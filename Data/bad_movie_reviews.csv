"Another let-down in the 'Conjuring' universe. Who would've guessed? Apparently, just having creepy looking villainous characters isn't enough to make a strong horror movie. 'The Nun' is a very creepy looking character, there's no doubt about that. But these films do not seem to know how to use her properly.The funny thing in these films to me, is when it's a minor character in danger - instant death. But when it is a major character in the movie - seemingly all 'The Nun' wants to do it jump out and scare you over and over again. It just makes no sense and really deflates all of the tension out of the movie.If you're a fan of jump-scares then there's good news. You're likely going to have a good time with this one. The movie is riddled with them. Some are well done, others not so much. The problem with horror movies based entirely around jump-scares is that they are instantly forgettable. Maybe you remember one jump scare if it was especially well done, but you certainly never remember the film as a whole.And I think that's the biggest problem here. There was nothing new, or unique about this film. Nothing that I will still be thinking about a week (or even 24 hours) from now. Just another forgettable experience and $22 down the drain. 4.5/10.",2023-09-07
"Given that The Nun (2018) was nothing more than a polished-looking series of loud noises and nonsensical happenings, I was not looking forward to the sequel.And even though The Nun II has its share of cheap scares and a few unintentionally funny moments, I was shocked by how much better it is than the first film.Flashes of greatness are seen here-more often than not it's directed with considerable skill and far more restraint than the first movie was. It's quieter and more patient at first, fleshing out its characters before things get insane in the third act.As for these character dynamics, they're actually interesting this time around. The dialogue is sometimes cheesy, but there's a sincerity to the humans in this story that gives a gripping quality to the film's perilous moments.There's certainly quite a bit of bad to be found here, but I actually liked more of this than I didn't. Hopefully these movies will get back to being good.",2023-09-08
"Sister Irene and The Nun is back in this most anticipated sequel from The Conjuring universe, and after watching this, you know what, just give up, stop making unnecessary sequels, or if you do, do something that really will put things on a different level. Taissa Farmiga as Sister Irene feeled more important, she did more, less useless, something I feeled from the previous Nun movie. But that doesn't mean that this made this movie better, because it didn't make it any better. Now I will tell you what was the few pros, and what made this movie to a disappointment. They had to stop The Nun, but they had to find out what it wanted and how they were going to stop it. They got clues, and the clues was a good thing in this movie. The clues were greatly detailed and unexpected. Sometimes they also made interesting ideas for a jump-scare, that was made in an interesting and creative way. But beside that, this movie was overall just very, very boring. It missed the suspense and the adrenaline that for example the previous one had. It was also many scenes that I feeled was just there to fill up the time and make this movie longer. Some characters had backstories that suddenly appeared in from time to time, but later they never really explained more of it.The last act was just too much. Some devils just come and gone, and it was too much mess here and there, the action was either entertaining or interesting in any way. The Nun II did have so many devils, but The Nun did appear only a few times in here, so I wondered if it could be better if they changed the title, for example to Tales of The Nun? It could have been so much better, and I could understand the idea better. From my point of view this is only called The Nun II only for the sake of the sequel reputation. But god, how disappointing. This is probably one of the most boring movies from this year that I have seen so far. To summary, this was a totally waste of time. It missed entertainment and suspense, and just so many details that could have been fixed. If you liked the first one, I don't know if you should watch this one. I had so high expectations, but well, not every movie is as good as they are showing on trailers, unfortunately. I can safely say that the trailer was much better than the movie.",2023-10-03
"Demons live and do their dark evil work in abbeys and churches, it would seem that churches are holy places - but no, not this time.👻👻👻 Probably, there is something wrong with the modern holy churches...even the senior priests, the characters are repulsive, soulless, deliberately strict - dubious ""parallels"" - don't you think? The subsequent destruction of teenage characters doesn't seem like a good idea, and it's not scary. The appearance of a demon nun is completely unimpressive, despite the excellent performance of the actress. Everything is predictable, all conflicts are formulaic. It takes effort to watch this tall tale, I don't have such titanic opportunities 😒😒😒",2023-09-22
"In my opinion, the character ""The Nun a.k.a (Valak)"" was best portrayed in the movie ""The Conjuring 2"". I didn't like its first solo movie. The atmosphere wasn't bad, but I didn't like it anyway. I didn't like the second movie either. It could be better. In terms of atmosphere, it wasn't as good as the first movie. The plot of the movie was poor. There ara lots of horror movie clichés. There were many jump-scare scenes. I thought it was out of fashion nowadays, but they used it too much in this movie. This spoils the viewing pleasure. There were a few scenes that I liked very much. Even though it was a jump-scare scene, I liked the goat scene. The acting was good, of course, but the weak script. BTW Bonnie Aarons was great again.",2023-09-09
"My dedication to the horror genre leads me to seeing a lot of films at the cinema that I fully expect to be rubbish. Like the Nun II, which I had very little real interest in watching since I couldn't remember much about the first one, other than the fact that I didn't like it. And for a long time, the film is just as bland and generic as I had imagined it would be, director Michael Chaves taking matters far too seriously, with a dreary pace, gloomy cinematography and all of the religious horror clichés he can cram in.Then, just as I was about to give up all hope of being entertained, Chaves seems to remember that, hey, horror films can be fun! After the introduction of a demonic goat (Satan himself?), the film really picks up, with action, excitement, and a few well-crafted scares (I think I actually jumped a couple of times, but that was probably down to the extremely loud noises that accompany the jumpy bits). If only there had been some of this liveliness during the earlier parts of the film - The Nun II could have been really good instead of just okay.My rating: 6/10.",2023-09-08
"I think I need to shift my perspective on what The Nun movies are supposed to be. The Conjuring films are great, full of scares, great writing. Annabelle is also pretty freaky. The Nun... feels more like Indiana Jones or a Disneyworld ride. Made-for-amusement-park action, props, and themes. Each time I go in expecting to be freaked out by ""the greatest evil in the Conjuring Universe"" just to walk away feeling like I went through a haunted house at Six Flags. The Nun II was not scary, barely interesting, and quite honestly boring at times. Conjuring Universe I love you, but let's send the Nun back to hell for good.",2023-09-09
"In 2018, this movie had so much hype but was disappointing with a cliche of jump scares. Fast forward to this year and it's actually a decent little horror flick that's much better than the first. There's a little more back story to it all that explains even some of what was going on in the first movie. No spoilers but I found the third act to actually be scary and kept my attention.This time around there are better make up effects for fans of gore. Thankfully it's not just gory either for the sake of gross but actually kinda scary. The movie opens with a murder mystery but the audience thinks they got stuff figured out but the big payoff was like, wow! This is one of the rare horror movies that's actually scary. Jump start the horror season and sit back for two hours of a good time being scared.",2023-09-08
"So, I was actually quite looking forward to this one. I wasn't expecting much from the original since sequels, prequel's and spinoffs often times are not up to par with their predecessors. However, I was quite pleasantly surprised with the first Nun and still think that it is a wildly underrated horror. So, after viewing this one, I must say that I was pretty disappointed. It was not a bad film by any means, but it did not live up to the quality of the first one and really landed in a very mediocre place.It had a quick start and didn't waste any time, throwing us into the action. Yet, even then, I stopped and thought ""well, that could've been cooler "". This same sentiment persisted throughout the majority of the film. It gave us some fun and creepiness, but then proceeded to move at a snails pace for quite some time. It felt like we were about 45 minutes in until I got any semblance of a real story line or something particularly intriguing. It really felt like they were going through the motions, an outline for a horror movie. As if they were following a map with very similar chain of events as the original.It is no secret that this franchise loves a jump scare. The first one was full of them, however, it was also balanced out by genuinely creepy and cool effects with a general effective spook factor. This one had a bit of that, but was mostly just riddled with cheap, unnecessary and superfluous jump scares. Even most of the kills, while still entertaining, were pretty basic. At the same time there were also some effective imagery especially in the third act, some gnarly effects, and some pretty awesome stunts that stuck out.I think my biggest issue with this is that the first one felt very deliberate and purposeful in many ways. It felt planned out and detailed... whereas this one felt like it was thrown together with the very bare minimum they could get away with as far as storyline went. Again, not a bad film, but nowhere near the quality of the first one for me. Would recommend, but not vehemently.(Also, what's up with all these fake reviews? Weird. Lol)IG - howlingatthemoonreviews.",2023-09-08
"In this nun outing, the scariest part of the story isn't about her... it's a goat.But even though there were some run-of-the-mill parts, the second nun movie is actually good, if you like the first movie. Some great scenes should be experienced in 4d cinema. Although, bring the jacket, because the wind is blowing in most situations!I liked that it got a little bit deeper in mythology. The scenery is great, as it was in the first movie - good directing. A lot of scary scenes, especially the one on the staircase. The things I didn't like - it's a little bit awkward with those annoying children and some dialogues seem forced.Overall, it's definitely worth seeing. This year is not really a good horror year so far unfortunately, unlike the previous few. So, so far this is one of the highlights.",2023-09-11
"""A Divine Disappointment"" falls miserably short of delivering the spine-tingling experience it promises. From a horrible story to a laughably predictable plot, this film stumbles into a realm of disappointment that not even the most devout horror enthusiasts can overlook.The most glaring issue with ""A Divine Disappointment"" is its inability to evoke genuine horror. Despite the promise of demons and supernatural elements, the film fails to deliver any real chills or thrills. The supposedly terrifying demons are more like caricatures, and their antics are about as scary as a children's Halloween costume.Adding to the litany of issues is the film's predictability. From the moment the opening credits roll, it's painfully obvious where the story is heading. There are no twists or surprises to keep the audience engaged, leaving them with a sense of unfulfilled anticipation.One of the most absurd elements of the movie is the notion that you can combat demons with wine, provided you believe in it. This absurdity not only stretches the boundaries of believability but also adds an unintentional comedic element to a film that desperately needed a dose of genuine horror.The central plot point of a nun residing in someone else's body and traveling across Europe that it becomes just another element contributing to the film's overall failure. The film lacks depth and fails to explore this concept in any meaningful way.In the end, ""A Divine Disappointment"" is a film that falls flat on all fronts. It's a horror movie without the horror, a plot without substance, and a story that leaves you wishing you had spent your time elsewhere. Save yourself the agony and skip this one; there are far better horror films to spend your time on.",2023-09-12
"So, 5 years after the release of The Nun, we get the The Nun 2, which after watching wasn't as great as I'd hoped!The film is set in France, 1956 where a Priest is murdered! An evil is spreading as Sister Irene once again comes face-to-face with Valak, the Demon Nun!I found the film to be ok, but a damper in comparison to its predecessor which is miles better than this! The film takes a while to get going & doesn't half drag & drag to the point where it you find yourself nearly falling asleep due to boredom!The film is 1 hour & 42 minutes in length, which a mid credits scene! The pacing is bad & the story is boring! That being said, the film does redeem itself with some scary visuals, jump scares & sinister goings on to be had in this film! The ending finale wasn't bad & pretty good!The characters aren't that interesting & that doesn't help with the mundane story & directing, which brings me to my next point, the film was Directed by Michael Chaves, who directed The Curse Of La Larona, which was ok, but nothing special & The Conjuring 3: The Devil Made Me Do It, which sucked! So of course, it shows his cursed directing shines through here as it was like those films, boring, flat & lacking in anything meaty & impact like!I see many people on here claiming this to be better than the first, it's not, not by a long shot! The first wasn't bang on perfect (what films are, seriously), but at least it was to the point & we saw the Nun Valak far more than in this to where we only see the Nun Valak for 5-10 Minutes of Screen Time tops!Overall, it's ok & not a bad watch, but I seriously couldn't get into this one due to the mundane story & flat characters! The Nun Valak was great in this despite being used too sparingly, as with the jump scares, visuals & spooky goings on! The film dragged too much, was overly long for what it was & felt pretty disjointed! It's not better than the first by a long shot! The first film is still the better film!5/10.",2023-09-08
"Please don't hand another conjuring-project over to Michael Chaves again. He slaughter them.This movie is officially the worst movie in the Conjuring universe so far. Everything were to much and at some point I started to think about what I would do when I got home since we all know that Maurice still would be possessed by Valak at the end of the movie.There were too much special effects, it would have been better to just keep some scenes simple. The scenes that were suppose to be scary either gave away to much before hand or were dragged out before the scare came that the suspence went away. It was a shame, some of them had potential.The actors did great job, I thought that the plot were okay and it had potential.I have to mention that the magazine-scene were really cool. Very well done.",2023-09-08
"Let's face it. The first Nun was the best one and it should've been just left to THAT! The first had far better scares, a far better storyline and sent off an unforgettable ending to where we understood how Valek came to the Warrens in America years later. With The Nun 2? I saw absolutely no reason as to why there should've been a second one, because we knew that Maurice became possessed in the first, the footage at the end showed us that he was older when he was with the Warrens and Maurice is honestly not a great character that you can count on to carry most of a movie. Which unfortunately, he did mostly lead it in this one, as the focus was mainly on him and everything was just super repetitive in this. It was dumb and not scary at all in the slightest. Although Valek is Valek, the actress, Bonnie Aorons, has always done a good job being this imposing figure and I've always respected her performances as Valek. That's that, but still doesn't the change the fact that this was stupid. You couldn't root for Maurice nor root for others. Hell not even Sister Irene you could root for. THIS was most of the movie: Let's run to a dark corner, then there's a lame scare. Lets explore with our light in the dark, then there's another lame scare. Let's run away while being chased and nothing else happens after that. Let's talk about how we can stop Valek. Let's look at something, then someone jumps out. Let's talk more about how we can stop Valek. Let's hide, think that we're safe, but then another ridiculous scare. I'm actually surprised I managed to get through this movie, because I really wanted to stop on the halfway mark. Luckily I wasn't watching this at the movies. Rats....just wish this had never been made.",2023-09-22
"Sister Irene is called upon by The Church to look into several strange and gruesome deaths of people attached to The Church. It is clear that The demonic Valek is back, and searching for something.Better than the first movie, but then I would say that was below average in terms of quality, I do however enjoy the franchise. I don't honestly think prior knowledge of the first is essential here, for anyone unsure, you could pick this one up easily.Plenty of jump scares, there's enough here to keep horror fans entertained, but if you're looking for an intricate and deep story, that's not really what this film is about.Some great use of lighting, they got it spot on, it's very atmosphere and sinister, the subtle visions of The Nun appearing look great. The streets of France look amazing, and that array of classic cars was incredible.There's some truly imaginative and atmospheric imagery, the scene with the magazines for me was the best of them, the trouble is, they showed all of the best bits in the trailers.The nun itself, she was well used, the didn't make the mistake of over lighting her as they did in the first, she presented a real menace.Several well known faces to watch out for good to see the likes of Suzanne Bertish and David Horovitch, for me it was Jonas Bloquet who stood out as MauriceOverall, this was a lot better than I expected, I really would recommend it.7/10.",2023-09-19
"I had low expectations for this, especially since I had just walked out of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3"" which was a total bore. But The Nun II surprised me. The story was genuinely gripping, and the movie sent shivers down my spine at times. Sure, it had some clichés, but it was executed well. Considering how saturated the horror genre is, specifically surrounding nuns and demons, it's tough to imagine what new tricks they could pull off here. While it didn't reinvent the wheel, it somehow managed to feel refreshingly eerie. I appreciated the dropped hints throughout the film, and they all came together beautifully in the third act, making it feel like a well-thought-out, cohesive story.There were a good number of jump scares, but they weren't haphazardly thrown in. I loved that the movie didn't rely solely on jump scares for its horror. Instead, it had entire sequences that had me on the edge of my seat, particularly in the third act, rather than just quick, cheap scares. The pacing was spot on throughout, and some of the scene transitions were masterfully done.The cast delivered solid performances. The characters felt well-crafted, and their chemistry and connection felt real. The actors skillfully conveyed the emotional depth of the movie. Horror films often prioritize jump scares and building an eerie atmosphere, so it was nice to see a strong emotional element here. I particularly appreciated that they didn't force the romantic subplot, even though the chemistry was evident. Taissa Farmiga delivered a stellar performance, but she wasn't carrying the movie on her own; the rest of the cast held their own and delivered decent performances too.My main gripe with the movie is that it still didn't explicitly explain Valek's origins, leaving it more as a theory. I did enjoy the introduction of another monster, the goat, which I found scarier than Valek himself. Valek's overexposure in the film, with one too many close-up scenes, made him lose some of his initial fright factor, becoming more familiar, less terrifying. Valek wasn't as scary by the third act because of this. But, again, that goat stole the show for me man. It was an incredibly terrifyying creature, especially to be chased by. What didn't sit well with me though was how easily the characters could thwart demonic elements by simply closing a door behind them. These are my criticisms: too many close-ups of Valek's face and demons being stopped too conveniently by closing doors.I haven't enjoyed a horror film purely for its horror in a while, so I'm a bit sad to hear some didn't share my love. Personally, I believe it's a significant improvement over its predecessor and a genuinely frightening addition to the horror genre. It stands well on its own and also fits seamlessly into the Conjuring franchise. And stay for the end credits; loved how fiendish and eerie they were; plus there's a credits scene that's more just a set up the next installment in the franchise. Probably a Conjuring movie, not Nun iii. I think The Nun definitely deserves another movie to round up a trilogy.",2023-09-09
"Good heavens! My cousin and I ventured into the crowded theater to catch ""The Nun 2"" today, and let me tell you, it was an experience of biblical proportions. The theater was bursting at the seams, with people snapping photos of the screen, heated debates over stolen reserved seats, and amidst this chaos, my cousin and I found ourselves in the heart of the theater, eagerly awaiting the film's commencement.When the film finally unrolled its eerie opening, I was initially captivated. The lighting cast an immaculately creepy ambiance, the setting sent shivers down my spine, and the subtle yet effective scares had me perched at the very edge of my seat. However, just when I thought I had this horror masterpiece pegged, it took a sudden turn. The opening scene transformed into an outrageously overt action-oriented visual spectacle, and from that point onward, the film shifted gears from horror to full-blown action.""The Nun 2"" barely qualifies as a horror film; in fact, it feels more like a disjointed compilation of scenes and set pieces that go from bad to worse, ultimately spiraling into the realm of the utterly absurd. From the inclusion of random goat monsters to the reliance on bombastic, quick-cut, shaky-cam edited jump scares in virtually every horror sequence, ""The Nun 2"" serves as a textbook example of what not to do when directing a horror flick.Yes, Taissa Farmiga is attractive - as is Storm Reid - but their sex appeal doesn't a good movie make. I was utterly shocked at how much the ball was dropped here; it was like the director forgot he was making a horror picture. Set pieces start promisingly and end ridiculously with predictable jump scares that, for some reason, have to include CGI visuals - have you ever wanted to see crows fly out of the mouth of a demonic nun? If so, you'll get your wish here! Everything, and I mean everything, is so pedestrian and run of the mill that you'll find yourself more scared by the whispers and comments of the audience then you will of the actual movie.And with all that said, I can't write anymore - this movie sucks. Don't see it!",2023-09-09
"Holy cow in RPX this was so satisfying! Sure part 1 wasn't a masterpiece yeah almost no terror based film is but this is so well filmed and ups the ante on everything especially in the last half I was very happy with way everything played out. Micheal Chavez created a well grounded sequel that would make Nun/Conjuring fans very happy! I was quite surprised there was only a handful in the audience for a 5:05 showing that's ok though me and the guy behind me were appreciative of the film. The cast was great, the flow was just right, and the horror elements hit the spot more than I could have imagined.",2023-09-13
"It is safe to say that with or without a writer's strike, american horror films as of late are the absolute pits. You can easily add the nun 2 to the not scary, no horror, no real story but massive CGI overkill to give the viewer something to react to genre. I'm just so very glad that I stop doing theater twenty years ago, cut my cable five years and watch everything and I mean everything online for free. And thanks to the govt funded ACP program, even my internet service is free. I just downloaded and watched MI dead reckoning yesterday and I gotta say it wasn't that great but ok popcorn. Tom Cruise is definitely the goat but I hope part two makes uo for the lackluster part one film. Back to the Nun 2, if you like CGI effects with no real substance, then have it. The Pope's Exorcist is another film of mindless dribble.",2023-10-04
"...but I can only blame myself. Usually it's ""fool me once...,"" but this time I went ahead and watched the sequel even though the first was abysmal.Valak the Nun was spooky and the concept worked, but only for its introduction in The Conjuring. The standalone movie was so dark and boring, I fell asleep. I don't blame the actors, just lazy writing and jump scare tactics.Here comes the sequel, and I thought, ""Surely it can't be as bad as the first one,"" so I got suckered once more.The sequel is boring, you can see the jump scares (if you can call them that) coming a mile away, and all it taught me was
1) Trust my instincts when choosing whether to spend money on a Conjuring-inspired film.2) Now you have to have a Caucasian and an African-American as leads because, well, it's 2023 (almost 2024). It's a non-written rule, I guess, that you have to pack a movie with every nationality possible or you'll get flogged.3) An ugly, white-faced Nun isn't scary when she/it never speaks or does anything but show up in every shadow from which you expect.",2023-10-04
"This movie is so poorly made, I couldn't believe the writers and director would stoop to this level! It's like they didn't even know what scene transition or story transition means. And forget about proper sequence or character buildup!Seriously, there's this guy who gets possessed and decides to visit chapels in every country in Europe to kill priests and nuns. Talk about a unique vacation itinerary!Then, the Vatican, in all its wisdom, asks this squeaky little nun, hiding away in some obscure monastery, for help. And guess what? She gets a useless sidekick straight out of the Minority section. Apparently, the Vatican's recruitment process needs some serious revamping.Out of nowhere, our little nun becomes a genius detective and figures out that the demon is after the eyes of a fire-resistant dead woman. Because, you know, that's a totally logical thing for a demon to want.So, off they go to France to find the ex-boyfriend( the possessed person). Just when you think things can't get any weirder, a goat breaks free from some colored glass and becomes a goat-man. Yup, you read that right.And let's not forget about the grand climax! The demon, who apparently resisted the blood of Jesus Christ, meets its demise at the hands of... wine. In a wine cellar. Brilliant, just brilliant.Honestly, this movie has no relation to the Conjuring franchise whatsoever. It's like they took a horror script and threw it in a blender with a bunch of random, idiotic ideas. Save yourself the trouble, even if you're a die-hard horror fan, and avoid this flick like the plague. It's a horror show in all the wrong ways.",2023-09-07
"Knowing that Ed is present for the exorcism of frenchie and that's technically a pivotal moment in the relationship of Ed and Loraine (according to the films), and the look Irene gives Frenchy at the end of the film makes me certain we're due for a 3rd Nun film. I had a feeling this movie was going to be a bit stale. The design and appearance of the Nun creeping in dark shadowy halls in the film has lost its shock factor. And the increased exposure of the creature has decreased the menacing creepiness of the Nun. It always was more terrifying when all you were able to see was a silhouette of the Nun and the pale face. I give them credit as they've built a pretty solid story building to the exorcism of Frenchy. They've also found creative ways of adding these religious relics to the storyline as weapons against the demon. When they first released Annabelle people were really creeped out by the dolls lore. In 2023 it's looked at as a new age Chucky doll attached to a major film franchise. It feels like the Conjuring Universe is building to something huge. I have said for years it's building to a Amityville Film as a grand finale. But after this film and the inevitable third film, it's clear that the franchise might want to find a new horrific creature from the cases of the Warren's to add to the library of horror.",2023-09-18
"We love these movies. We have watched every one and we had high hopes for this one. My husband enjoyed the first nun. I was not impressed because as fans of the conjuring universe we know what they're capable of and I felt like both could have been much better. Our kids were not even impressed. I think one of our daughters screamed once when Valek made the first appearance but after that, meh. This was not worth watching in theaters in my opinion. I'm getting irritated with these movies. I get it. Everything has been seen and done but wow. This was awful and a poor attempt at a sequel at best. It was boring. I barely made it through. Don't waste your time.",2023-09-10
"A demon nun sounds great on paper, and if properly written, might even be quite scary. In this sequel we are once again treated with the same jump scares; nun images appearing anywhere (as long as the person is alone) and the nun itself replacing the image with a jumpy sound on top, grabbing the person by the throat or just opening its mouth. Then someone enters the room and the nun vanishes.Anyone could write this stuff. There's nothing new or original here. You don't even need an actor to play the nun. Just throw some average cgi of a face with rotten vampire teeth on a painting or a wall. There's no story either. It's just a compilation of scenes I mentioned earlier.Also the black nun wasn't believable at all. She acted like a modern teenager who does what she wants.People are grabbed by the throat, bones cracking and lifted several feet in the air, but they appear completely fine soon after. What's up with that? A free fall doesn't cause brain or organ damage? Or being thrown on the wall doesn't make your heart completely stop?Not funny. Not scary. Not interesting or intelligent. What the hell is this? It's nonsense.I can't recommend this to anyone. 1/10.",2023-10-28
"This was really bad! The moment I saw a black sister smoking at the parish or whatever, I knew this wasn't going to go well. But I was hopeful so I kept watching thinking there was some sort of rich story behind what's going on. I was wrong. The story didn't make any sense. And to make it even worse, now, the Crucifix isn't enough to stop a demon, you need the eye of Saint Lucy. But as it would seem, she didn't even need that, she just had to pray and barrels of holy wine would blow up, splashing all over the demon and that was the end.It's so bad, I actually found the end credit more sinister than the whole movie put together.But I must say as usual the performance was amazing, the costumes were great, the acting spot on, I loved the kids screaming every chance they go haha. But the let down was the horrible script that went nowhere.",2023-10-07
"4 years after the events of the first film, Valak is now on the move and dropping bodies at the holy places. As these mysterious deaths catches attention of the church, they suspect Valak to be behind it and approach Sister Irene to investigate. However, Irene figures out that Valak is on a treasure hunt and she takes it upon herself to stop Valak once again. How will she stop Valak and what miracle she needs this time around to help her out forms the story.Not to spoil much, the ending reveal of The Nun clearly shows what happens to Maurice which in turn makes this sequel more like a filler episode. Keeping that in mind and setting aside the slow narrative, the film resorts to the generic scare tactics and the narrative too is uneven. As a result, this film fails to provide a single character to connect to and the returning characters of Irene and Maurice fail to evoke enough drama.What works for the film is the final act and Valak unleashed at the boarding school. The proceedings does get intense here and to be fair, it is the final act that saves the film. The dearth of scares is somewhat made up in the last 20 odd minutes which elevates the predictable ending to an extent. Though it is not as dull as the first film, it doesn't add anything new to the Conjuring universe. The post credit scene is just fan service.",2023-09-07
"For a movie about a demonic nun, this contains very minimal nun.The Nun 2 is a dreadful movie. The kind of film which relies on quiet, quiet, bang! (To quote the good doctor) to see it through. The more Conjuring Universe movies they do, the more they eat themselves and make little sense.The movie is 1hr 50m and feels every minute of it. It takes Taissa Farmiga over an hour to reach the boarding school and by then all interest has waned.There are some scenes that have potential, like the scene at the newsstand, which could have been really good but is executed so poorly and drags on too long it loses all effect.The title character gets a little over 3 minutes screen time (mostly coming in the climax) and that is the films biggest issue. They introduce other form of demons and forget all about The Nun.The Nun 2 is far and away the worst movie in the franchise and sadly it looks like we'll be seeing more of Maurice in The Conjuring: Last Rites. Oh goodie.",2023-09-17
"""The Nun II"" (2023) skillfully sustains its momentum, escalates the suspense, and delivers some genuinely terrifying moments. The narrative is tightly woven, with each scene expertly building upon the last.In comparison to its predecessor, ""The Nun II"" is significantly more accomplished. It may not be ready to ascend the ranks of the greatest horror films, but when it hits its stride, it's a truly chilling experience.The film's direction is coherent and articulate, a significant improvement over the first movie. Each scene is purposeful, driving the narrative forward while developing the characters and building suspense.The film invests time in character development, adding depth and soul to its characters, unlike the first installment. For instance, the scene where Sister Irene confronts her past presents an emotional depth to her character, making her more relatable and her struggle more palpable.The performances are commendable, with Taissa Farmiga standing out. Her portrayal of Sister Irene is both powerful and deeply emotive, further solidifying the Farmiga sisters' stronghold on the Conjuring Universe.However, the horror element of the character Valak is somewhat diluted due to its familiarity with audiences. The anticipation and fear gradually build up scene after scene, only to result in the familiar sight of Valak, leaving audiences longing for more unpredictability and diversity in the scares.Nevertheless, ""The Nun II"" has a cleaner narrative structure compared to the first movie, and the final act offers an aptly exaggerated dose of horror.The movie's technical aspects, including set design, costume, and art direction, are top-notch. The haunting beauty of the abbey, combined with the stark contrast between the nuns' white habits and the decaying surroundings, creates a visually stunning and deeply unsettling atmosphere.In conclusion, the movie is a significant improvement over its predecessor, offering a more focused narrative, stronger character development, and a better-executed horror experience despite the familiarity of its main antagonist.",2023-09-12
"I wanted it to be better...it started off pretty well...seemed to have high production values...and things were being set up well...i hadn't seen the first one, the Nun, but from the reviews saying that this one was better, i'm sure i didn't miss anything.After the first half of the movie it seemed to go steadily downhill... like the writer could write a good 'straight' setup but had no imagination when it came to horror parts...it seemed cut and pasted from previous schlock movie ideas, which is a shame because it seemed to have potential. But that potential went unfulfilled. Real weak second half...",2023-10-10
The story is uninteresting and boring. Valak popped up here and there and was only present at the end for about 5 minutes. This defeats the purpose of having this movie because people want to see the nun not a guy possessed for the entirety of the movie. This film felt like one of the typical exorcism movies that come out every year except they just called it the nun. The characters were very basic and forgettable.The ending was crap. There wasn't anything particularly scary about this film.The end credit scenes were creepier than the actual film.Just wait until it streams and save yourself the disappointment. This is by far the worst horror movie of the year.,2023-09-13
"Not sure why the high rating the cgi may be was good, otherwise they insist to insult the conjuring universe with this, just jump scares every now and then, the story isn't that much connected, I felt many times to quit, but my Love to wan kept me sitting, it's not better than the first one, it's just the same, and I think that the climax didn't really respect our intelligence, they wanted to finish it and they were helpless so they invented the matter of inheritance, also the poor demon who can burn and kill priests disguised day and night wandering the whole movie around the relic but unfortunately he can't discover the secret that was buried beneath his eyes, please stop this sequel or bring wan to fix it.",2023-10-26
"Now i'm actually one of the very few people who actually really like The Nun (2018), i thought it was as close as it gets to being as good as James Wan's Conjuring movie, with The Nun II i don't really have a high expectations especially knowing that the director of the movie was the same director who made The Curse Of La Llorona which is one of the worst horror movie i've ever watch, and i'm glad to say that Michael Chaves directing has been improved in The Devil Made Me Do It and now The Nun II was overall a good enjoyable scary sequel that takes things i don't really like in the first movie which is Jonas Bloquet as Maurice, not only he's one of the main lead in this movie, he also a complete attitude opposite from the previous movie in a good way, and the thing that i really like from the first movie which is the straight forward fast paced movie, The Nun II takes more time that could've been work even better if the stuff was really interesting and to be honest most of the time it wasn't and i just need to get back to get scared again but it's not like every single time, the relationship thing was whatever but i don't hate it, Storm Reid character also whatever but i also don't hate it, the jumpscare most of the time works just fine and there is some couple of really interesting and one particularly good build up, unfortunately there is one very cheap jumpscare that i don't like, but Valak was really just the most badass and one of the best evil in horror movie ever, and there is one new demon combined animal in the movie that are just creep the hell out of me and it was great, performances were all good, the story still overall works for me, the movie set and looks also pretty good, there is literally couple of really cool and beautiful shot in the movie, and it's surprisingly pretty brutal, overall i really enjoyed The Nun II, it's another entertainingly good intense scary entry in The Conjuring universe, and i'm also surprisingly pretty hyped for that mid-credit scene and i'm still interested for the future of the franchise.",2023-09-06
So I saw this movie yesterday and the movie was awesome scary and very intense with a great twist at the end and the mid credits scene was good and this movie is definitely a better movie for the director Michael Chavez who directed the last two movies of the Counjuring Universe and he did a better job at directing and making the jump scares scary the movie does kind of slow down but the acting in the movie was good and I would definitely recommend going to see the movie and avoid spoilers. I give this movie a 8/10. If you have not seen the first go see it before the this movie because there are spoilers for that movie.,2023-09-08
"The Nun II is a super solid horror sequel. It has two good stories that come together with a great third act. It has incredible scares and effects, the scene in the magazine store is my favorite, as is the final scene, which is really epic, the atmosphere is very good and chilling, and sister Irene is really incredible, just like Bonnie Aarons, Storm Reid stays on I stood with a great performance throughout the movie, Anna Popplewell was the one that surprised me the most, she showed that she can express the fear and despair of the character, the soundtrack is unique, they really did an amazing job, I really enjoyed this movie and it has a small post scene -credits that fans of the franchise will surely love.",2023-09-06
"The movie is better than the first but still very generic. Same ol jump scares, everything is always in the dark, which makes the scares predictable and it's just not very intense. Took my son who gets very scared watching horror movies and he was bored. The themes that it evolves around have been done better before and you get the feeling that you've seen it all before, because of the way the movie is written and handled. I'm a big Horror fan and I love the conjuring universe so I really got excited to see it but these spin offs don't really do it justice. It's sad to see that they just can't make a spin off in the same caliber as the first two conjuring movies. You can watch it on a Sunday but it's really nothing exciting at the movie theaters.",2023-09-25
"The Nun II takes its time building the narrative and delving into character development. Unfortunately, the Christian relic's relevance and backstory, especially concerning Sister Irene, remain underexplored. While the film is well-crafted and directed, the resolution of the mystery and subsequent events feel somewhat rushed compared to the extensive setup.Taissa Farmiga delivers a solid performance, but one craves more depth in her character beyond the initial portrayal. Jonas Bloquet's likable character arc from the previous installment is a highlight. However, Bonnie Aarons as the titular character lacks the expected menace and terror, except for a memorable encounter with Maurice's young friend, Sophie.The Nun II boasts occasional atmospheric brilliance but falls short of consistently delivering in the vast Conjuring universe. Its low scare factor, uneven pacing, and reliance on horror cliches hold it back from reaching its full potential. While it somewhat redeems its predecessor, it still doesn't meet overall expectations.",2023-10-26
"Judging from the end-credit scene (at about 1:44:30), with the appearance of Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, I don't think that there will be a The Nun 3 - but you never know.Taissa Farmiga (Irene) is back in this sequel to 2018's The Nun (2018). Jonas Bloquet (Maurice), as the lovable handyman is also back, but, not on his own.Usually, sequels suck and never capture what the original did, in this case, it was better done than the original. Is it a masterpiece, no it isn't, but it is an enjoyable movie experience, well above average. Some scenes do let the movie down, but the better ones out weigh these. I would recommend this.",2023-10-07
The NUN wasn't something I expected to be groundbreaking. While it definitely wasn't it was still much better than it had any business being. A solid origin story spin off for Valak with a nice more religion focused story. Also with some surprisingly well done settings and visuals. This sequel does basically everything the same but adds more visceral imagery and slightly more depth to the characters. There's also plenty more depravity and evil lurking around presented in more intense manner. While it won't do anything truly innovative it serves as another solid entry in the conjuringverse. Some may be sick of it at this point but it's a nice kick off to the Halloween horror season.,2023-09-07
"Honestly, I don't usually write movie reviews but I just got out of this movie and I feel obligated to comment.Just a few days ago I watched the first movie again to refresh my memory. At the end of the first movie, Ed and Lorraine introduced Maurice (Frenchie) in a video where he is being exorcized. Where was this scene throughout the second movie? If in the end the demon is expelled from him (at least this is the assumption at the end of the second movie, unless there is a third movie where this will be explained) then who filmed it and when did it happen??Also, in the scene where the ""Satan"" (in the form of a goat) chases the boarding school girls, one of them got a pitchfork penetrated her through the door and a second later she ran as if nothing had happened (?!).In the scene where the nun sets Irene on fire, Irene remembers a flashback of her mother telling her that she got her eyes, but her mother has blue eyes and Irene has brown eyes. It was not clear.Overall I gave a score of 6 mainly for effort and effects because they were pretty good (I especially liked the ad wall scene)I have a sense this is gonna turn into a trilogy, but we'll only know further on.",2023-09-06
"I've been a dedicated fan of the Conjuring Universe since the very beginning. Turning out to the theater on premiere weekend for each Insidious, Annabelle, Conjuring and Nun movies. I really enjoyed the first Nun movie, great actors, scary setting, cohesive story, great build up, heart and scares of course. But I have absolutely no idea what happened with this sequel that is The Nun 2. I'm in utter disbelief at what I just saw. Every part of the story was jumbled and rushed with too many unimportant things thrown together. Nothing about this story worked or flowed. There was no build up or genuine horror/scares. It was so corny and I could not wait for it to end. They ruined Insidious with the The Red Door and now the Nun 2!? What on earth is happening to this franchise?! We need James Wan and Leigh Whannel back asap. Someone with a vision who can write a decent script and movie! Yikes! Also I'm so bummed about this review ugh...",2023-10-28
"From the start till close to the end, this movie relies heavily on jump scares. Which is a very annoying thing to do when that's the only scary thing about the movie. Valak in this second movie was very disappointing to me. Kinda seem weak, relying on the meat suit to do his dirty work. And that ending was very convenient. I mean, what if sister Irene's not the descendant of Saint Lucy? Game over?! Bah! I hope the next installment of Conjuring series will do better than this one. And please try to make good jump scares, not the cheap ones like the ones that are made in this movie. I added another star from my initial rating to give the writers some encouragement.",2023-10-10
"The Nun 2 reunites us with sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga) and Maurice (Jonas Bloquet), though they have gone their seperate ways with sister Irene now serving in a convent in Italy. Maurice works as a handy man at a boarding school in France, where he has befriended a young Irish student named Sophie (Katelyn Rose Downey) and her teacher and mother, Kate (Anna Popplewell aka High Queen Susan).The movie follows the resurgence of Valak once thought destroyed and defeated, but apparently not as the movie soon shows us. The movie while still scary is not as scary as say The Conjuring 1 and 2 as while those are based on real events and documented cases The Nun 2 is purely fictional. The Nun 2 does have a nice little side romance to it between Maurice and Kate which Sophie actively encourages and helps to take place.I for one definitely think the storyline is solid, it is scary and well done with a nice romantic twist to it that I wouldn't have minded seeing more off.The cast is brilliant and do superb jobs of bringing their characters to life on screen. Taissa Farmiga aka Sister Irene is a younger, prettier version of her older sister well known for playing Lorraine Warren. While Jonas Bloquet does a marvelous job as Maurice going from kind, quiet man to possesed scary demon. Anna Popplewell is a absolute gem in the film and even with the limited screen time her character Kate gets you can see why Aslan chose her as a High Queen or Narnia. Katelyn Rose Downey who plays Sophie is only 14 but she is adorable in her role and gives us a lovely on-screen performance, can't wait to see her in future movies especially within the horror genre.The VFX and SFX are brilliant, which for a film like this is very important. The scares were cool, the visual effects for Valak were terrifying and is just a all round good job!Overall a well deserved 8/10 from me, I enjoyed it and will definitely like to see another especially since at the end of the film for all intents and purposes Valak is gone but we all know that at the beginning of The Conjuring 1 the footage that is shown by the Warrens is of Maurice possessed once again!P. S. As you can see by my lack of any mention of Storm Reid's character the nun Debra, there was literally no need for her character to exist. No clue why they added her in as her character brought nothing useful to the storyline and her and Sister Irene's early interactions only slow down the development of the plot which is why many reviewers said it took a while for the plot to get off the mark. It's also the reason I gave this a 8 rather then a 9 out of 10, due to the story dragging just a bit there at the start and the fact that Kate, Sophie and Maurice could have done with some extra screentime instead!",2023-10-05
"The Nun II was nothing new! Well, first time I walked out on a movie, but not because it was that bad! A couple was talking so loud in tagalong we could not watch. Told them to pipe down, went to front and the couple just got louder! That was the sacrist part of the movie. Before, the walk out, I found the Nun 2 had usually jump scares, boring C G I, and formulated evil present following the same guy. The same woke type cast characters behaving in the flat character non imaginative character arches! My wife wanting to see part 2 and the mystery was part got her attention. I found the mystery or plot twist so transparent it would be anti climatic. The only mystery I found during the experience was the questioning was that couple having a fight/break up, or just incredibly ignorant? From the 45 minutes I saw I did not miss much of an ending, unless there was a vast improvement. 4 stars.",2023-10-07
"LIKES:Atmosphere:
-A strong use of shadows that adds horror elements, the theater of horror is a believable world where the Nun can pray.-The light is again used to put the air of safety, but those pockets that show where she can attack when the time is right.-And the elements that the Nun used to bring horrors are the focus, integrated into the story and that gets points in my book.-To always use the avenues and some natural scare settings, that was the best use of the environment that I've seen in a while.The Sound Editing:
-Nun's second adventure is one of those that does so much with so little.-It's all about using the silence to build up and try to fake you out, adding that calculating terror that I do quite enjoy in how your comfort is robbed.-But then the movie goes and adds some other components to help add the more exciting moments including: steady pounding on doors, subtle shifting of textures like wood and stone, and those roaring moments that top it off.-To then add the theatrical music and screams to the mix of the victims, only further helps to add the illusion of horror and the belief of the actors facing these monsters.The Pace:
-The movie is quicker than some of the others, and from the mystery/thriller elements of the story, that's not a bad thing
-This movie may be nearly two hours long, but it doesn't feel that way, and is quite enjoyable in how they keep things moving, but still accomplish the build-up and adding some story elements in the process.-As such, it's an engaging pace and that makes for a fun tale to join in the theater specks.The Acting:
-It's a horror and it's about making characters to follow this dark journey through with them.-Reid as a new side character is both fun and endearing. Her tough attitude with compassion is a fun addition to Irene's skills, but has a little shakeup that they can play with in the future.-Bloquet's reprisal of his role is wonderful in terms of how he took the baseline characteristics, but evolve them to the latter part of his life. Another level of etiquette, mixed with goofiness, adding to a deeper role that makes for a fun character you care to find the answer to.-And Farmiga is wonderful. Her charm, beauty, and that fervor are in her performance and to act the way she did was fantastic.-They all know how to convey horror. They know how to act possessed or tormented by the demons, and they know how to show injury, and their chemistry is still tight, though a tad stiff this round.The Story:
-Conjuring may have started with scares, but there was a story element that helped you pull into the tale and have stakes.-Nun II is still working on that story element, helping take the characters form the first film to give more light, fill in most of the gaps, and push towards where the prequels keep going.-There is some good character integration, some lore that has spiritual ties that this movie is thriving on, and overall just a decent horror element that is comfortable, but yet deeper.-And giving the Nun a little more spice and layers helps give the continuing series more backbone, especially when she now has an objective over just usual possession.-All that works to make this movie have a little more bite than what you might find on a Netflix special.DISLIKES:Predictable:
-The story is still a tad cliché and gets too caught up in trying to connect the dots that something gets taken out of the picture.-Suspense is kind of gone when you know the ending is coming and will only go so far, so that suspense and mystery is kind of gone leading to some boring moments.-For viewers like me, the familiar breadcrumbs are being laid out, the familiar foreshadowing, words, and out of the way lines that you know are leading you the path.-By this point, these films are hard not to be predictable, but this at least buffers the scares. Which brings me to my next point.Not Scary:
-I'm probably desensitized, but these movies don't really do much for me in scare departments once you get the tricks.-The Conjuring movies, and even Annabelle Creation had these moments that push the boundaries and really scare you. Subtle gestures, unexpected jump scares, the surprises, and the stakes... they all worked.-This movie kind of has lost this, so caught up in the drama elements that it buffers the scares and makes them kind of boring. More melodramatic than anything else, the scares are just excessive screaming and have lost some of that discomfort.-And for a movie that is known to be creepy and scary as its main bite... that really was not as much fun as I had hoped.Too Many Genres in One movie:
-When a movie tries new things, it can be a breath of fresh air, or just the right touch to make things better.-However, when going too far that you stray from your genre too much, you get some of the dislikes I mentioned.-By going so heavy into Drama and Thriller, the scare again felt diluted for me. The shorter run time means the mystery is buried by the attempts at scares and lots of elements and the mystery is rot of bland.-Add the more dramatic elements further and you get those horror filled finales and climaxes feeling cheesy, over the top screaming, and often too much than what the original did, which seems to be the modern trend.-There is a lot of things that can be worked but either more time was needed or we needed to get the group together sooner and have a more engaging mystery on our hands, alongside making a fight that doesn't feel like WW84.The VERDICT:
The Nun II is great for being a thriller/drama, whose story and atmosphere are the niche things for watching. It ties the story together, redeems our characters and adds more to their story, and still finds ways to help expand the universe in a positive manner. With shadows and an environment that is about doing a lot with more realistic and little stretching, you really have those elements that pull you back into the messed and bizarre adventure and seeking the truth of this demon's journey. And yet, the movie still has some work to match the splendor of the original conjuring movies that started this all and keep to the roots a little more. The scares need less set up and more spontaneity. They need to be a mixture of tactics and really find that natural flow they used to have, but are now gone to the modern day theatrics. And continuing to find that storytelling with horror are not quite there, but I found this better than several of the other movies like the third installments of Annabelle and Conjuring. Is it worth a theater visit? I don't think so , as there are other movies coming up that might be better for your viewing pleasure of horror. Thus my scores for this film are:Mystery/Horror/Thriller: 7.0
Movie overall: 6.0.",2023-09-08
"I'd never thought a new installment in this franchise could make me say this but this one is absolutely the most terrifying, the darkest, the most successful and profound movie of the whole universe - keeping the original, The Conjuring (2013), off of the topic 'cause OGs can never be replaced.I am so proud of Chaves that he's put his name, talent and vision out there and become an immortal name in horror cinema history. Hardwork always pays off as it did so much here!! You are awesome Chaves!The visuals, the sound design, the make-up, the costume designs, the set design are absolutely over the top with so much hardwork and commitment behind.I congratulate everyone till the fullest. The whole cast did a phenomenal job. The commitment by everyone made The Nun II (2023) an amazing, superb much enjoyable movie without a doubt from my pov at least.I already can't wait to binge rewatching for the next few days.",2023-09-08
"Taissa Farmiga's is back as the nun ""Irene"" in ""The Nun 2"".It's rare to find two talented sister actors in the same filmic universe, but her sibling (who's 21 years her senior) Vera Farmiga, is one of the great 21st century Scream Queens who plays ""Lorraine Warren"" in ""The Conjuring"", ""Annabelle"" etc.Jonas Bloquet resumes his role as as ""Maurice""...no relation to my Radio & TV mate Ian Maurice.Bonnie Arrons is back in the make up chair transforming herself into the Demon Nun, ""VALAK"".They say, ""The Nun 2"" is the greatest evil in the Conjuring Universe.I beg to differ.""Annabelle"" just creeps people out without even trying, whereas this sequel to ""The Nun"" felt very try hard, however is still way better than the original.What I loved: The Panavision cinematography and the seamless segues from one scene to another in a different place without any linear connection.I also loved the scenes in the third act with the young child and the possessed man that paid homage to hauntingly spooky films from my youth involving staircases and steeples.What I hated: Corny jump scares and sheeted ghosts...the stuff of R L Steins ""Goosebumps"" for children not the Conjuring Universe and the overwhelming number of characters at the beginning of the movie springing up all over Europe.More characters than a Tolstoy novel is hard to wrap your head around, especially when the action shifts place from one dark old building to a similar one in a completely different place.Pet hate: It's set in the 50's and even though electricity was definitely a thing they rarely turn on a goddamn light switch.Watch out for: The Magazine Page Turning scene.It was so complicated to film, but totally worth it and stay alert for clues of letter's spelling out the Demon Nuns name in various places.Goofs: A power cord in one scene was not available in this post war era. It's like a character accidentally wearing a smart watch, it stood out like dogs testes.Director Michael Chavez is now officially the most used director in Aussie James Wans' CU and with good reason.His movies are very stylish, they just need some more substance and stop treating audiences like morons with so many flashback clues...we get it!Alright already.Having said that it would pay to see the original ""The Nun"" on #Netflix prior to watching this because 5 years have lapsed between productions and the sequel does not stand alone well.For the finale who knew sacramental wine otherwise known as ""the blood of Christ"" could be so damn powerful?I'd drink it daily if I knew it could battle demons.Wait for the end credits and a bonus Easter Egg scene that will pull all of this into the CU.Considering I gave ""The Nun"" 1 star (mostly for young Taissa Farmiga's impressive performance as the nun ""Irene"") this sequel has come well up in my estimation.Some images will haunt you long after you've left the cinema.",2023-09-08
"Watched it on the 1st midnight screening and I can say.. THE TRAILER DID NOT DISAPPOINT!! The climax kept me on the edge of my seat I couldn't finish eating my popcorn. Valak was more evil here than before. The cinematography was great, the scares were good. I would really watch it again on cinema if I had the chance but with lesser and quieter crowds. The crowd was kinda annoying though, I can hear them talking, laughing, and making jokes which probably is their way of comforting themselves during scary parts. Overall, THE NUN II is really worth it to watch on the big screen.Looking forward to the next movie!",2023-09-08
"In The Nun II, everything deserves praise. The story, performances of the cast, creepy, tense, and frightening atmosphere, direction, screenplay, cinematography, horror sequences and sound effects, ending, and symbolism, are all great and have nothing to be said against them. If the person wants to compare these elements to the ones of the first movie, they will easily notice that they are a significant improvement over its predecessor.Regarding the flaws, what I didn't like in the movie is the mid-credits scene, which was vague, and its meaning is not understood, and some story elements. Other than that, everything else was great. That is why when it comes to the score, I gladly give The Nun II 9 out of 10.",2023-09-08
"Plot :
Lame and Boring, There is no plot twist, every characters have neither intention nor motivation. Just 2D Characters. Rely Solely in Jumpscare

Shallow characters,
the main characters doesnt push the plot but pushed by the plot
Maurice doesnt go better, he didnt try to fight back the nun but just rely on main characters act.The demon just 2 D characters, didnt have any motivation didnt have any intention, just scare aroundConclusion :

"This is Chaves' third Conjuring universe film and likely his best. Much like its predecessor, The Nun II does a fantastic job with the brilliant atmosphere it establishes. It's also backed up with great performances from each member of the cast, and there's some very creative sequences and camera work throughout the movie. Also loved how they used the characters of Irene and Maurice with this one too, where they felt underdeveloped in the last film.However, this film doesn't have enough of the freaking titular Nun. It also has too many slow buildup scenes that lead to multiple unnecessary jumpscares, some questionable moments, and a few parts of the story that aren't well established. I expected more from Akela Cooper on this front knowing her stellar writing on Malignant and M3GAN.Overall it's still very solid. It's a massive improvement over The Nun (2018) and serves as a nice entry into the Conjuring universe, even though it doesn't quite live up to the standards that were established with the demon nun character in The Conjuring 2.",2023-09-07
"Well... alright, not exactly ALL female cast... there are a small handful of background noise characters, but that's all they are so you can just ignore them. The only... and it even makes me sick to type this word, but.... male ""star"" is pure evil, so... thank the gods we can ignore him too!We all know that the cast of the original ""Nun"" was way too light, if you know what I mean. Thanks to the award requirements, they were finally forced to add some color to this franchise. I guess the filmmakers figured one girl would be enough, but at least (within the first five minutes no less!) she WAS able to work into a conversation that her family was driven from their homes in Mississippi and ended by the why-teaDevils in hoods. That helps to make up for the fact that she is the only one of our sisters in the whole movie, but not much.I was really glad to see that they were able to work into the plot a subtle swipe at the Catholic faith, from the mouth of a nun, no less! That one nun (not our strong, brave sister, though) was on the train trying to justify her faith when she said ""as Catholics, our beliefs are only real because we believe."" lol...My only real gripe with the movie is the fact that they couldn't afford lighting :( There isn't a single light bulb in the whole convent or in the girls' school. There are a few nightlights in the Vatican's archives, but they are so dim, that they don't even light up the books, much less the scene. There is a small lamp on each desk, but it just barely provides enough light to read by. The strong, brave, independent sisters in arms surrounding the desk can't even be seen!",2023-10-30
"Seriously disappointed with this sequel as I really enjoyed the first installment. Here, however, the story was pathetically put together, failing to capture attention for more than the briefest of moments. Completely disjointed. Struggled to stay awake. Worst film of the year so far, and there have certainly been some strong contenders. I would advise saving your money for something else, that is, unless you've been struggling to sleep and need something to help you nod off. Not a single jump scene provoked even a muscle twitch from me, my sentiments were echoed listening to others as we walked out of the cinema. An all round snooze-fest of the highest order, so terrible it inspired me to write my first ever review here.",2023-09-11
After seeing the first nun 5 years ago 2018 . It did have some jump scares . But this one was more terrifying. The nun tempting the French man since the first movie was really really scary and very exciting. The kids were really good . The one who really nailed it was Anna Popplewell who was know for Narnia 18 years ago really enjoyed working on a nun who was trying to tempt the people of France . The demon goat was so terrifying and who ever played him win definitely be in the next conjuring movie or nun 3 . The filming in France and Italy was the perfect story for the nun since it's known for ww1 ww2 Wars .Congratulations everyone for working so hard on the nun 2 . I hope Universal Studios does a horror maze next year.,2023-09-10
"I went in thinking I would like this, and I did for a while, then I started to hate it, but I ended up more or less fine with what I got. First let me explain the hate.The movie starts well, has creative scenes and suitable jump scares early on with solid acting and silky cinematography, but then you get the creepy feeling that you've seen all this before...the slow pans, the light flickers, the sudden drop in volume leading into a jump scare...and not even in other movies-just a few minutes earlier, in this movie. The first rate performance of Farmiga began to be eclipsed by the redundant use of fear tactics, despite the lovely locations and masterful camera work. Couple that with some frustrating inconsistencies in the risk factor the characters were facing, and it began to pull me out of the moment.The plot, let's be honest, is only salvaged by the convincing actors and the pacing and scares, but that's not terribly uncommon for possession movies. Read it off a page and it sounds hokey as all get out. Throw it into scenes and it sometimes works, sometimes just feels like horror-flick fodder from the recycle bin. But the real sin, to me, was how powerful these spirits were, until it mattered, and then suddenly they can't seem to effectively hurt anyone. They can chase a hidden relic across multiple countries by what? Intuition? But can't locate a loud group of people hiding in a silent building two feet away?Character development was minimal and some true ex-machina was required to stitch up the plot, so much so that we get a flashback montage at some point near the end that is supposed to explain something, but felt woefully lacking.But, let me digress from the hate and explain why this is in no way a 3 star movie:First, there's Taissa Farmiga. This woman has skillful mastery of emotion on screen and acts with a frenetic energy that pulls this convoluted plot along nicely. The urgency and piercing cadence of her on-screen persona feels to riveting and authentic that I'd gladly return just to watch her in another installment and I'd recommend the movie just for that. She reminds me of what i loved so much about Eddie Redmayne in the movie Black Death . The other actors lent their own skills to varying degrees, but Farmiga was the star for a reason.Then, the filming. The locations, lighting, camera work and sets were all rich and expertly crafted, immersing the viewer in the dusty glory of post-war Europe. Visually, the movie was very effective and up there with anything that's come out in the last few years. I enjoyed watching it, in the literal sense of the word.Also, I like catholic horror, and despite the quirky plot and weird risk inconsistencies, the general vibe of the film was something I enjoyed, although that is very much a preference, as sometime who consumes a lot of these kinds of films.So, maybe I'm being too harsh. Maybe I just need a little faith and shouldn't have to explain things, but man, these demons are so limited by plot convenience it feels like the devil himself can't foil this lazy writing, much less sniff out sobbing school girls in small confined areas, and no matter how many times you get choked, burned, slammed against stones, bashed in the head or casually tossed across a castle, if you've got God (AKA plot) on your side, you won't even limp in the next scene. Maybe I missed some important point about how God works that the movie explained during one of my long eye rolls.",2023-09-27
"An origin story going back to the 50s and a dark ambiance all round made ""The Nun II"" run like a worthy sequel to the first instalment.Bonnie Aarons' performance as Valak, the demon Nun herself, was extraordinary. It was scarier than ever before. Everything Taissa Farmiga brought to her role as Sister Irene was amazing. She carried the plot in more ways than one.The idea of Valak returning to her old ways and Irene - who'd initially dealt with the creature - being brought back to apply her experience was a neat and elegant way to go about this sequel. In a story typically driven by men (i.e., a pair of male priests), it was nice to see two young nuns take the reins.The year was 1956 - in Tarascon, France - and that's when everything went to hell. Or rather, a demon stepped out of it. They amplified the horror this time round and made Irene go head-to-head with Valak who, by this time, started using the sister's old friend Maurice like a carrier and puppet.This creature isn't a female entity per se, but an ancient male (supposedly) demon that took on the twisted form of a nun to spite the 'workers of god'. This is classic demon psychology, to take what people consider sacred and blaspheme it just because it can.The plot was eerie in all the right ways and frightfully fantastic. They dealt a lot with faith this time round in deep, almost theosophical, ways.They also gave the demon an actual aim to pursue. It was after an ancient relic - belonging to Saint Lucia, the patron saint of the blind - that would grant it power to fulfil some dark agenda.Captivating back-stories (in keeping with the times) made the plot feel well-rounded. I also liked the 30s/40s/50s European aesthete. It made the whole story seem compelling, almost historic.Also, there was more than one demon in this movie - that satanic goat entity was an outstanding addition.Notable Catholic overtones blended beautifully with hints of macabre sacrilege, defining the character of the titular demon nun in scary and unforgettable ways.The magazine rack page-turning scene was of particular interest to me. I hadn't seen something like that in a horror movie before. It felt fresh and original (to an extent) and created an intense sensation of imminent danger. This scene is under-rated and needs more appreciation.The way the team manipulated sound effects and 'dark spaces' was clever, almost ingenious. It truly felt like watching a yester-year cult-classic horror flick.They leaned more toward silent-terror anticipation than taking the easy way out with jump scares. They didn't skip the action either. Some of the face-offs were so physically violent.I was also impressed by how simplistically they connected Irene's ancestry to that of the saint herself. Irene's ability to perform 'miracles' made more sense. The lore around this was impactful, and provided timely clarification in the movie.Apparently, the demon nun's victims were all descendants of Saint Lucia, whose family line was scattered following her escape from persecution.Granted, with stories like this there is only so much wiggle-room to get creative, let alone original. But the team made do with what they had and delivered a strong tale rife with creepy suspense and demonic delights.The idea that belief in something can make it so, and thus make the impossible possible, was well portrayed in ""The Nun II"". This concept has been the crux of nearly every demon-based movie that contained Catholic elements.Be sure to watch the first movie before starting this one, because they connected some relationships and moments that took place in 2018's ""The Nun"".And remember to catch the post-credits scene in ""The Nun II"" where the team connected this movie's events with the ""Conjuring"" universe, as seen through the eyes of Ed and Lorraine Warren.",2023-10-05
"""The Nun 2, while receiving some praise, falls short of its predecessor (my personal opinion). It grapples with a somewhat underdeveloped plot that barely scratches the surface. Its leisurely pace, while aiming for suspense, often left me struggling to grasp the unfolding events and their significance.In contrast to the first installment, the Nun 1 relies more on mood and suspense to produce the horror. The Nun 2 leans heavily on jump scares and gruesome scenes to get it by. The intricate sets and rich locations that added depth to the original are replaced with a more minimalist approach, such as using just a couple of sets to shoot the majority of the scenes is a potential letdown for fans of the series.One disappointment for me was the limited screen time of the titular character, who instead possesses another character to carry out her sinister deeds. This departure from the first film's focus on the Nun's malevolent presence left me wanting more.The film introduces a perplexing element with the enigmatic saint's eyes, leaving me questioning their purpose and the Nun's motivation. This ambiguity adds an unnecessary layer of confusion.Additionally, The Nun 2 struggles with narrative inconsistencies, presenting potholes that detract from the overall experience. The supporting cast, unfortunately, fails to leave a lasting impression, making the film's characters easily forgettable.While The Nun 2 has its moments, it ultimately lacks the depth, atmosphere, and coherence of its predecessor, making it a somewhat uneven addition to the franchise.""",2023-09-17
"'The Nun' was released in 2018, almost five years back. I can't remember much about the story other than that I objected to it and considered it one of the weakest additions to the 'Conjuring' universe. This is partly why I kept my expectations in check for this sequel.And maybe that's also why I ended up enjoying it. To me, this second instalment feels more sophisticated and more refined in almost every aspect compared to its earlier iteration. The scares are more effective and staged with plenty of conviction and confidence. It also maintains the eerie atmosphere quite well.However, there are still some issues that need to be addressed. For instance, the pacing is inconsistent; as a result, the screenplay seems to stretch at regular intervals.Then, there was this messy final act, which, following two relatively nuanced junctures before, transitioned into an exaggerated culmination, which kind of put me off during the concluding moments.Last, but not least, Sister Debra feels like a wasted opportunity. There was plenty of scope to develop and nurture the sisterhood, the bond between the sisters, Debra and Irene, or they could have easily made their collaboration bear more significance.Alas! That wasn't meant to happen, and they ended up having a non-meaty, inconsequential coalition that had brought no notable output and had no significant role to play in the script.",2023-10-05
"""Nun 2"" falls short of expectations, leaving audiences disappointed and feeling like they've wasted both their time and money. Despite the potential for a thrilling sequel to the 2018 horror hit, this film fails to deliver on multiple fronts.One of the most significant letdowns is the lackluster plot. It lacks the depth and intrigue of its predecessor, offering a clichéd storyline that feels recycled and uninspired. The scares, which were a highlight of the first film, are disappointingly predictable in ""Nun 2,"" relying on jump scares that no longer have the same impact.The characters also suffer from underdevelopment, making it difficult for viewers to connect or empathize with them. The talented cast, including Taissa Farmiga and Bonnie Aarons, is largely wasted on one-dimensional roles that offer little room for growth or complexity.Moreover, the pacing feels uneven, with long stretches of the film feeling tedious and slow, only to be interrupted by moments of chaotic and confusing action. This inconsistency in pacing disrupts any potential tension or suspense that the movie could have built.While the cinematography and production design maintain a certain level of visual flair, they cannot compensate for the fundamental flaws in the storytelling and character development. It's evident that ""Nun 2"" attempts to capitalize on the success of its predecessor without delivering the substance that made the original so compelling.In the end, ""Nun 2"" is a disappointment that squanders its potential. It's a lackluster sequel that fails to capture the essence of what made the first film memorable. Save your time and money and skip this one.",2023-09-10
"The long-awaited sequel to The Nun transports us to France in the 50s, where Valak continues to spread terror using Maurice as a guest and this time the new setting is an old sanctuary turned orphanage. It's a pretty intense thriller and it's well produced and well acted. It has interesting scenes and Valak seems to become more powerful in this sequel. The only detail is that as good and interesting as the plot is, there was still more to add. More could have been explored about young Sophie and her relationship with Maurice, as there is good chemistry between them. What is fascinating is Sister Irene with respect to her visions and her past because it seems to serve as a clue as to who was her possible ancestor and that Irene is possibly related to Lorraine Warren. It is even curious that the actresses of these two characters are sisters. It is also necessary to mention it¿s way of reflecting religious terror, according to the Catholic faith that existed at the time, and he fulfills that part well. The Conjuring franchise leaves different sensations in the public because of the love or hate that some may have for the movies. The only thing that makes us want to continue watching this franchise is because it was based on real cases of supernatural phenomena or demonic possession. To conclude, The Nun 2 is not a bad movie, but it still had more to offer. My final rating for this movie is 8/10.",2023-09-09
"The Nun II is the second Nun and newest film in the Conjuring film series. This second Nun film is directed by Michael Chaves, who also directed The Curse of La Llorona and The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, previous films in the Conjuring film series. With this film, Michael Chaves currently has the most directed film in this film series under his name.The film is set in 1956 four years later after the actions of Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga), who managed to stop the demon Valak (Bonnie Aarons) in Romania.When a priest is murdered in France in a similar manner to what happened in Romania, Sister Irene is asked by the church to investigate the murder. During her investigation, she learns that Valak is back and tries to figure out what she's trying to do before there are more victims.Apart from some other places and new characters, this second Nun film offers little new. The Nun just has different, dark plans this time. The film can quickly come across as repetitive and remains predictable. As a viewer you can stay ahead of the story. Especially if you've seen the first Nun film.Most horror moments also remain a bit on a recognizable or predictable side. They often use simple jump scares, but most of these you can see coming. There are some creative jump scares in the film, but most of these can already be seen in the trailers, so you know approximately when and what is coming when you watch the film. Furthermore, most characters also commit the standard horror clichés, such as investigating mysterious things alone or going for strange noises. When they are in an empty, dark room, they shout hello or ask if anyone is there.The writers of this second Nun film have also opted for two more separate storylines, which eventually come together again. Yet these separate storylines feel largely disconnected from each other, sometimes making it feel like you're watching two different movies. The Demon just manages to pop up again and again without any real explanation. Because of these predictable and unclear aspects, the film does have its long-winded moments.Taissa Farmiga knows how to perform well again, but ultimately she deserved a better story and final film. This also applies to the rest of the returning cast members. Bonnie Aarosn, who plays the Nun, unfortunately gets less time in this film. The shape-changing demon unnecessarily chooses to take other forms. These forms are just not as terrifying as the Nun himself. Some of the younger actors in the film are still at the beginning end of their acting careers, which unfortunately is reflected in their acting in this film.",2023-09-09
"Superb natural sets - Couvent des Prêcheurs, Aix-en-Provence, Bouches-du-Rhône, France - highlighted by quality cinematography.Combined with remarkable performances from actresses and actors, especially the youngest among them (Katelyn Rose Downey...), make this follow up to The Nun (2018), and eighth installment in 'The Conjuring Universe', a film that is both frightening and pleasant to watch; preferably on the big screen.I must admit that I had a little trouble falling asleep, alone, last night with the images of this atmospheric and effective gothic supernatural horror film still etched in my mind - ha ha.",2023-09-19
"The Conjuringverse, a horror franchise, lacks phases, chapters, and shared prayer. Instead, it relies on patience and the haunted house built by James Wan. The Nun II, a sequel to a prequel, is a delightful exercise for the franchise, showcasing the elements of The Nun that worked and improving what didn't. The sequel brings back Sister Irene and Frenchie, who were the best parts of The Nun, for another round with Valak, the demon nun. The screwball chemistry between Irene and Frenchie is a key factor in the story, but they are separated for most of the runtime. Sister Irene investigates a series of violent deaths in Catholic churches across Europe, and Valak is stowed away in Frenchie's soul. The series ends with Valak escaping the Abbey of St. Carta, but Irene doesn't know all the details, making the story more engaging and challenging. As the Conjuringverse enters its 10th year, it has plenty of frights left in it. The Nun II features likable protagonists Irene and Frenchie, with Irene's confidence and faith bolstered by Farmiga's sensitive performance. The film fleshes out Irene's traumatic past through flashbacks, adding new meaning to her fight against Valak. The family's past is integrated into the new additions to Conjuring mythology and the McGuffin at The Nun II's heart. Frenchie, a groundskeeper at a girls' boarding school, becomes close with Kate and Sophie. Although Irenchie and Bloquet's performances are enjoyable, his bigger role feels like a double-edged sword. The film ends with a re-surfacing of an early scene from The Conjuring, highlighting the character's fate. Frenchie's growing affection for Marcella and Sophie adds tension to the story, especially when Valak's attacks put the students in danger. The plot armor takes some of the air out of the character's peril, but the growing affection for Marcella and Sophie adds to the tension. The Nun II, a horror movie, has moved its action to a more populated French village, specifically a boarding school, allowing Valak to plague characters beyond the leads. This results in more creative and unexpected scares from mid-century European architecture. Director Michael Chaves and writers Akela Cooper, Ian B. Goldberg, and Richard Naing use the first act to set up forbidden locations and cursed games, including the debut of a scary goat. The movie's back half is made unpredictable by an out-of-left-field attack on a kid, which has zero impact on the story. The Nun II is Michael Chaves' third film in the Conjuringverse, following The Curse of La Llorona and The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It. The film showcases Chaves' strong visual sensibilities and humanist interests in a funhouse of terrors. The mythology-heavy plot is too fast for the movie's weight, but it's inventive and reverent to Valak's menace. The action moves to a boarding school full of scared kids, with no character feeling completely safe. Taissa Farmiga and Jonas Bloquet star as Irene and Frenchie, and Chaves keeps the heart of Valak's reputation in focus.",2023-09-11
"***Spoiler Alert***The beginning is decent(1st 45min) The rest is just ok, a few mediocre jump scares...And the actual Nun is maybe in the movie for a total of about 10-15min for a movie that's 1hr 50min...it's very similar to Halloween Ends...It should've been called The Possession of Maurice...I have a few questions in the last act how the hell did the girl get off of the ledge with no stairs or ladder in sight that is really baffling for that matter the entire last act is baffling, like when Maurice could have easily killed Irene multiple times he just tossed her aside, and what was the point of the goat demon besides a time killer...I have so many more questions...lol.",2023-09-10
"This was a movie that I wasn't shocked to hear about coming out. I also wondered why it took so long. The original synopsis I saw called it a worldwide hit. Financially yes. From what I've heard from most everyone, it was panned. I didn't mind it but it also felt like another of the mindless, popcorn Conjuring universe films. Regardless, I did end up seeing this in the theater to support horror.Synopsis: 1956 - France. A priest is murdered. Evil is spreading. This follows Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga) as she once again comes face-to-face with Valak (Bonnie Aarons), the demon nun.We start this in a church in France. I believe that we have an alter boy who loves soccer, named Jacques (Maxime Elias-Menet), entering. He is told to get the wine from the basement by the priest. Father Noiret (Pascal Aubert) then leads Mass. After it is over, they clean up. Jacques is scared in the basement when there seems to be a figure in the dark and the bottle of wine explodes. He runs upstairs. Together, these two encounter the evil nun, Valek. It ends up with the priest burning alive. We see a man with a suitcase walking away from the church after.This movie then splits into two stories. Also in France is a boarding school for girls. Working as the groundskeeper and maintenance person is Maurice (Jonas Bloquet). I'll be honest, it took me a bit to realize that he is from the previous movie. He takes a liking to Kate (Anna Popplewell) who is a teacher here. Her daughter also attends, Sophie (Katelyn Rose Downey). She is bullied and Maurice stands up for her. The principal is also messed with by the bullies, Madame Laurent (Suzanne Bertish), as they release cockroaches in her office from an abandoned wine cellar at the school.The other story starts at a convent. Sister Irene has taken up residence here. A newer nun here is Debra (Storm Reid). We learn later that she is from Mississippi. She is defiant, not necessarily wanting to take the holy vows. She was pushed into this by her father. A story is told here by the nuns, which is about Irene. I'm not sure they know that.Irene is then called back into service. There have been deaths across Europe, starting in Hungary. There seems to be a pattern involving a saint, St. Lucy (Kate Colebrook). Irene puts together that Maurice could be part of it. We also see that Valak has followed him to France. Irene catches and train. She is joined by Debra, who snuck away. Irene warns her of what they'll face. Debra is dealing with a crisis of faith and this ordeal could help her there. It also could cost her everything in the process.That is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. Where I want to start is with a problem that I had. It is with me and not necessarily the movie. I've seen the original one when it hit theaters. I hadn't seen it then and nothing pulled me too. I didn't even revisit ahead of this rewatch. This movie moves fast and I was lost for a good section early on. It didn't help that I had a bad theater experience. I'm not going to hold this against the movie though. I'll give credit that you can watch this without seeing the previous one as it does fill it in which I appreciated.Let me start with the positives here. This is a violent movie. Seeing the priest caught on fire early set the tone. We then see things throughout that I wasn't necessarily expecting. They went with an R-rating here so that makes sense now. I figured this was PG-13. The lore that we get here is good as well. There isn't more backstory for Valak, they're building on what we got in the previous movie, alluding to what she is looking for rather than exploring more of her past. What they're doing here is giving a purpose to what seems like random attacks on churches across Europe. I do think this is a bit far-fetched. Knowing the rules of family trees, which would be possible though. I am going vague here to not spoil things.Something else that I thought worked was the atmosphere. Having this set mostly in this old monastery turned winery and now into a school was good. There is this great room with a stained-glass window. I liked how the girls play a game with it and this is to set something up later. There is that old world, European darkness vibe I appreciate. I'd also say that the soundtrack here helped that foreboding feeling. That is another plus for me.Continuing to build then, let me go the rest of the filmmaking. I thought the cinematography was good. What surprised me is that this seems to rely less on jump-scares than other movies in this series. That's not to say that we don't get them. We still do. It just isn't only that. What I like about the cinematography as well is the framing. I love where there are things that we see that look like Valak. There are times that it doesn't amount to anything. There are others where it leads to scares. I'm a fan there. I'll also say that I'm not the biggest jump-scare fan, but what it does with them here was fine.All that is left then for me would be the acting. I liked Farmiga and Bloquet reprising their roles. That helped to build the story as we have the built in history there. Reid was solid as our newcomer and side kick to Irene. I liked what they did at the school with Popplewell, Downey, Bertish and the rest of the students. They don't use much of Aarons as Valak which surprised me. It is more of just a cameo there. I do like the religious stuff that we get to build the story. This just feels lacking there.In conclusion, this is a fine sequel to a popcorn movie. We're building off what we got previously. I think that this is just interesting with Valak being a perversion of good. There isn't a lot of depth to this one and what we get is surface level though. The best part is the atmosphere and the score. I'd say the acting works well in bringing the characters to life, but none necessarily stands out. I'm glad this doesn't solely rely as much on jump-scares. It also goes brutal at times. This one is a fun movie to watch once and then move on, especially if you like The Conjuring series.My Rating: 6 out of 10.",2023-09-22
"It seems the evil Nun spirit is not dead yet and is making its way west. We see a priest get toasted in the first scene. Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga) is reluctantly called back into service where she plays detective and exorcist. The trip goes to a Nun's girl school. Kate (Anna Popplewell) has left Narnia to work there as her daughter Sophia (Katelyn Rose Downey) who is bullied by the other girls also attends. She is friends with the groundskeeper Maurice (Jonas Bloquet) known as ""Frenchie"" in the first film. He had saved the life of Irene. Sister Debra (Jonas Bloquet) who lacks faith travels with Irene.They decided to film it at a school of screaming girls. My biggest criticism is that the film was dark. There was this full screen in front of me and for most of the film, all I could see was a small circle of a flashlight. I understand this adds to the atmosphere, but when you do it constantly, it loses the effect. You are given a film one plot recap with a nun telling a story and at about 65 minutes you get a full plot explanation in this one. Really don't need to have seen the first one to watch this one.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",2023-09-17
"The Conjuring movies have made their fortune by being uncomplicated and simple horror films, essentially the scary equivalent of a Marvel movie. Nothing is wrong with that necessarily, sometimes you want to turn your brain off and enjoy some silly jump scares. The Marvel comparison grows stronger when you consider that the Conjuring movies are the only horror franchise to successfully pull off the coveted Cinematic Universe. Unfortunately, the Conjuring movies only seem to grow worse over time.Having seen the first Nun movie, I knew not to expect much from the sequel, and even still my hopes were too high. The Nun 2 is enrtirly devoid of subtlety. The monster follows no rules and is all powerful right up until it isn't. The plot is a wacky mix of the Exorcist and Indiana Jones and feels more like anime in tone than horror.If you're looking for something creepy that will get its hook in you keep you thinking about it long after it ends, watch Hereditary or the Witch. If you want something loud with repetitive jump scares and comical acting, the Nun 2 could be a good way to spend your evening.",2023-09-21
"While The Nun is a overhated but fun spin-off, this sequel is a huge improvement and is up there in quality with the first two Conjuring films and Annabelle: Creation as one of the franchise's best. The two main leads, Taissa Farmiga and Jonas Bloquet are back and gave it their all with their performances and of-course Bonnie Aarons as The Nun/Valak still terrifying as she should be as well the entire cast gave realistic performances. The terror and scares are better here and are less predictable and well timed. Michael Chaves, I owe you an apology because you 100% delivered here especially with his eye for visuals and aesthetic. I guess third time's a charm. Overall, The Nun II is a welcome addition to The Conjuring Universe and hopefully we'll get a trilogy.",2023-09-07
"It's a Good Watch with Great Visual Moments.Elements of the Film -1. There were 1 or 2 Particular Shots Which Did Have Suspense, Mainly Because you are looking in the Dark off to the side and You See the Form of the Nun Possessing this Man, and Partially you see Her Dimly Lit Eyes.2. I Loved the Visual Ideas and Dynamics of the Nun Appearing Via, Wall Patterns, Statue, Newspapers, 📰, Paintings etc.3. The Main Plotline was Solid with little Sub things Going on with the 2 other Main Nuns.4. The Visual of the Nun being able to Fully Materialize through gaining the Eyes, and Floating and it Going Super Bright and then Super Dark was such a Brilliant Visual Moment.

"Compared to The Conjuring 3 this movie was better from The Nun part 1. The characters were well written and the continuation was good. Taissa was done her role perfectly. Jumpscares worked well.. but compared to first part jumpscares are low. BGM and sound effects was perfect. The horror theme was well executed. Not that much gore in this movie, but it was predictable. The climax was little disappointing similar like the first part. Overall, just go without any expectations and you will be satisfied. Also there is a mid credit scene that will be the reference for Ed and Lorraine's next chapter.",2023-09-07
A very uncomplicated and simple storyline. Actors were good. Was expecting to have Valak back with all her glory but was disappointed.In the second half there was a creature with horns. Couldn't see it properly. They called it the devil but it's fate was unresolved.The climax wasn't impactful enough as the previous so I was a bit disappointed. It could have been prolonged a bit more. While watching the climax I assumed it was just a warm up before the final big bang but then realized that is it.It was a boarding school and the class had several children but the climax included only around six. Was wondering where the others were when so much distructon was going on in campus.The name of the movie is The Nun. I assume it refers to the bad nun who should be given more screen time.Finally It was not a bad movie but nothing that magnificent either. I hope the next sequel is better than the trailer.,2023-09-08
"Sister Irene was the sole survivor of a demon attack some while ago. It appears the demon is still at it, and is homing in on what is now a boarding school for girls, in the persona of likeable gardener Maurice, who is possessed without realising it.This is not so much a horror film as a suspense mystery with a horror climax and a few jump scares along the way. The story is quite good, albeit there are some seeds sewn which don't grow into anything worthwhile (the bullying schoolgirls subplot never really goes anywhere). And, overall, the film works quite well.On the negative side, a lot of it takes place in almost total darkness with, perhaps, a single miilion-watt torch beam illuminating proceedings. And the final climax has poor possessed Maurice, a vaguely seen devil goat, a reanimated dead priest, and the creepy titular nun all bashing about at the same time, which puzzled me somewhat.",2023-09-14
"I absolutely loved the first Nun movie. It was fast paced and had many scenes that were genuinely hard to watch due to its nature but what on earth was this Nun 2? Firstly the story was such a slow slugfest, it never really mounts onto anything. The characters weren't really thought out and as an audience I completely felt uninvested. The acting of most actors were so terrible that it felt like a cheesy SciFi budget horror movie. Although the main two actors did phenomenal in the first movie but the story and screenplay was so bad in this one that even they couldn't carry this movie. And it was so stupid on how they briefly mention that the Priest from the first movie has just randomly passed away and no one seems to be surprised or wants to investigate, he was such a good actor and his character was so compelling in the first movie.It was really hard to imagine this sequel tied to Conjuring series. I really really hope they don't make anymore of these Nun sequels. I'm going to pretend the first movie was the main Nun story. Overall this sequel belongs in trash bin unfortunately.",2023-09-11
"First of all, when I first watched the official trailer of the movie I really liked it and I was so hyped about it. Eventually, it was as good as I had imagined and I really enjoyed it. The plot of the sequel was very interesting and mysterious, even though it was similar to the previous movie. Also, the storyline was well-written and well-explained. The characters were very interesting, well-developed and really likeable. The filming locations of the movie were some creepy, abandoned churches. The casting of the movie was nice and their acting was really good. In my opinion, it was a very scary movie and there were too many jumpscares. The killcount of the movie was very bloody, even though most kills were done off-screen and nothing explicit was shown. Moreover, it was a very intense movie and there were too many action-filled scenes. The opening scene was very creepy, promising and I really liked it. The ending scene was kinda predictable, even though the 3rd act was definitely enjoyable. The ""Valak"" was definitely terrifying and way more brutal, than the previous movie. Overall, ""The Nun 2"" was an enjoyable sequel, scary, intense and I would definitely recommend it to my friends. Last but not least, I'm definitely looking forward for a third movie...!",2023-10-25
"Okay, Imma be honest here. Near the end end of the movie I was almost asleep at my seat in the cinema. What was that.?! Really. So... The plot of the movie was okay, like it's having a plot which is great, because most horror movies nowadays are just for the kills and jumpscares. My problem is tho- it had TOO many filler scenes, 20-30% of the scenes were so unnecessary and boring. Another problem I really have (which I have with a lot of horror movies) is the jumpscares... Is it that hard to make an unpredictable jumpscare, just once?! If you can't make it, just don't add jumpscares to the movie, it's that simple. If you're a fan of The Conjuring and you think this one is probably similar, well it's not- It's much more boring and I wouldn't watch the movie again.",2023-10-22

". . . NUN II is as good as the 2010 convent epic, NUDE NUNS WITH BIG GUNS. Unfortunately, the action here pales in comparison to BIG. Other than a couple of levitation scenes, the activity during NUN II is pretty down-to-earth, and leaden at that. While this 2023 picture occasionally hints that the locales depicted are fertile ground for potential Roman sects crimes, it generally pulls its punches and fails to spell out rampant iniquities as do better flicks including SPOTLIGHT, AGNES OF GOD and GUNS. Similarly, featured Sister Irene seems too unaware of her surroundings to insure any longtime survival in such a foreboding milieu.",2023-10-07

"The Nun II surprised me. The story was genuinely gripping, and the movie sent shivers down my spine at times. Sure, it had some clichés, but it was executed well. Considering how saturated the horror genre is, specifically surrounding nuns and demons, it's tough to imagine what new tricks they could pull off here. While it didn't reinvent the wheel, it somehow managed to feel refreshingly eerie. I appreciated the dropped hints throughout the film, and they all came together beautifully in the third act, making it feel like a well-thought-out, cohesive story. There were a good number of jump scares, but they weren't haphazardly thrown in. I loved that the movie didn't rely solely on jump scares for its horror. Instead, it had entire sequences that had me on the edge of my seat, particularly in the third act, rather than just quick, cheap scares. The pacing was spot on throughout, and some of the scene transitions were masterfully done. The cast delivered solid performances. The characters felt well-crafted, and their chemistry and connection felt real. The actors skillfully conveyed the emotional depth of the movie. Horror films often prioritize jump scares and building an eerie atmosphere, so it was nice to see a strong emotional element here. I particularly appreciated that they didn't force the romantic subplot, even though the chemistry was evident. Taissa Farmiga delivered a stellar performance, but she wasn't carrying the movie on her own; the rest of the cast held their own and delivered decent performances too.My main gripe with the movie is that it still didn't explicitly explain Valek's origins, leaving it more as a theory. I did enjoy the introduction of another monster, the goat, which I found scarier than Valek himself. Valek's overexposure in the film, with one too many close-up scenes, made him lose some of his initial fright factor, becoming more familiar, less terrifying. Valek wasn't as scary by the third act because of this. But, again, that goat stole the show for me man. It was an incredibly terrifyying creature, especially to be chased by. What didn't sit well with me though was how easily the characters could thwart demonic elements by simply closing a door behind them. These are my criticisms: too many close-ups of Valek's face and demons being stopped too conveniently by closing doors.Overall very underrated sequel its one of those so bad it's good films director Michael Chaves did better than LA Llorona.",2023-09-13
"I finally get to watch The Nun 2 with my mom, and I gotta admit, it was pretty much better than I thought it would be. I even tried to understand it, like I tried to understand the first movie, but some of it got pretty confused. Not too much, but some of it.The Nun 2, takes place in 1956, after the event of the first Nun movie in 1952, because it's recently connected to multiple timelines in The Conjuring universe. The jumpscares were interesting, some of it are campy, and the story was pretty well done.Taissa Farmiga still did a pretty good job with her part, and Storm Reid did a great job too, and from the director of The Curse of La Llorona, and the Conjuring 3, did a pretty good job directing this movie! Not bad at all. It was pretty scary and enjoyable when it comes to James Wan as the producer of his best work for his horror movie making industries.",2023-09-13
"I wish I had watched it next week. The lunar seventh month isn't over yet, and I'm still feeling a bit uneasy. The Conjuring 2 is definitely much better in terms of its scare factor compared to The Conjuring from five years ago. Although both involve exorcisms, this film focuses a lot on how the ghostly nun appears unexpectedly at any moment. Even though the female lead isn't the type to get easily scared, perhaps it's because she's a nun, but the audience's terrified expressions are even scarier than the lead's. This just goes to show how much bang for your buck you get in the cinema, clutching your partner's hand throughout. I highly recommend the special effects when the ghostly nun makes her appearance, especially the part mentioned in the trailer where the pages of the bookshelf turn to reveal her. That idea is just brilliant.",2023-09-13
"I saw The Nun 2, starring Taissa Farmiga-The Gilded Age_tv, The Bling Ring; Jonas Bloquet-Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, 3 Days to Kill; Storm Reid-Euphoria_tv, A Wrinkle in Time and Bonnie Aarons-The Conjuring 2, Drag Me to Hell.This is the second Nun movie but her third appearance-she made her debut in The Conjuring 2 in 2016 and her second was in The Nun in 2018. Taissa-a newly graduated Nun-is called upon to investigate a trail of strange deaths in the clergy that are occurring across Europe. She discovers that Bonnie/Valak the Demon Nun is responsible and heads on the road to try and stop her. Storm, another Nun and friend to Taissa, decides to tag along for support. When the trail leads to a Catholic school, Taissa meets an old friend, Jonas, who is sort of a handyman at the school. You learn what Bonnie is searching for and why Bonnie's eyes glow like they do. Hint: It has something to do with what she is looking for. There are a few jump scares-as can be expected-but Bonnie is just creepy as heck. It is also a little slow in parts. As the end credits start, there is a scene with a familiar couple from The Conjuring Universe but there isn't anything at the very end.It's rated R for violence, terror and some mild language and has a running time of 1 hour & 50 minutes.I liked it better than the last one-and I liked that one, too-and I would buy it on DVD.",2023-09-09
"The Nun II is a marked improvement on its predecessor, as the winning duo of Taissa Farmiga and Jonas Bloquet reward the faith of Conjuring fans with a scarier, meatier boarding school nightmare that makes great use of Valak the Demon Nun, even if the mythology-heavy plot specifics get a little lost along the way.If you're expecting a totally original horror flick, you'll be disappointed. But if you're looking for nothing more and nothing less than a film where a barbaric nun slaughters everyone in its sight, then this one ought to be watched. Directed by Michael Chaves, the one who helmed La Llorona, The Nun II is an improvement, although an unnecessary sequel, that improves on jump scares even though the storyline could have been way better.My Rating : 6/10.",2023-09-17
"Woh, this is one rollercoaster ride of horror, suspense, trepidation and mind-blowing effects. A lot darker than the first instalment. Set in a boarding school, Valak has returned with another rampant reign of terror.As an avid fan of The Conjuring, Insidious, Annabelle and The Nun franchises I was excited to watch The Nun II. Having avoided spoilers I had no idea what to expect. Sister Irene returns, as does Frenchman Maurice and they both steal the show with super strong performances. The setting is dark, creepy and atmospheric within a girls boarding school.There is character development with Sister Irene, which ties in with this current instalments storyline. It was very satisfying to get to know her a bit more.We see more of Valek in this one too, played by the phenomenal Bonnie Aarons, who is incredible and a horror icon.After watching this movie I felt like I had been through a mangle. It is a horror fans delight. Fans of the franchises I mentioned earlier will be very happy and excited that there is a post-credit scene.I highly recommend this movie but not for the faint-hearted!",2023-09-26
"I have to admit I was honestly very impressed with this sequel to what I consider to be an utterly dire film The Nun. There is a complete step up across the board in terms of story characters, cinematography and pacing.Much like Annabelle Creation having children in the mix (played incredibly well by the young actresses involved) helps to add genuine tension and scares, particularly in this genre of horror. The fact that the young school girls are in genuine mortal danger and are being rag dolled around rooms and impaled is just straight up frightening to watch. Again massive kudos to the young cast involved for really stepping up to their roles. Tassia Farmiga also seemed a lot more alert and emotive compared to her stale performance in the first film.I really enjoyed the more spectacular style plot it worked really well to inject life into the film and the pacing was much better this time around. It didn't really drag for me at any point which was another welcome surprise.Overall this is a massive improvement on the first film and coming after Annabelle Creation in chronological order it's another hit for me in my Conjuring universe journey and genuinely makes me more hopeful for the rest of the series.",2023-10-04
"The Nun II: Sister Irene is back in an Italian convent but Fr Burke is dead so she gets a sidekick, Sister Debra, a novice from the US. Frenchie is also still around working at a girls school in France. The Demon is also back, leaving a trail of dead nuns and priests across Europe as it travels westwards, We see Father Noiret in Tarascon, France being confronted by the Demon in the form of a Nun, he is levitated and bursts into flames, Demonic activity also takes place at the girls school. A Cardinal sends Irene forth to investigate the deaths and Debra sneaks along as well. Their quest involves strange visions for Irene, some harmful others help them on their way. Much of the drama at the girl's school is soapish but the tinges of horror continue, Eventually these narrative strands will combine. The Demon as a a Nun often appears in from within pareidolia, emerging from/retreating into stains on walls, sculptures, even a rack of magazines whose pages are stirred by a breeze. The Demon also takes on shapes of friends or relatives to confuse it;s victims. At one stage it becomes even the Devil in goat form attacking and goring people. This film is quite disturbing, plenty of shocks and violent deaths and possessions along with psychological horror. Surpasses the original and it is a worthy contribution to The Conjuring Universe. Directed by Michael Chaves, from a screenplay by Ian Goldberg, Richard Naing, and Akela Cooper. 7.5/10.",2023-09-13
"As it is known, these movies have great stories, will get you very stressed and nervous but the scary scenes never land as they should. Anyway, it is enjoyable if you like the genre.I was worried I couldn't remember what happened in the first movie but there's no need to rewatch it haha, it's pretty simple and a bit explained in this one.If you're a fan of The conjuring and Annabelle, this is definitely for you. I would say The nun is not better than The conjuring and not as bad as Annabelle, so it's pretty likable. And the actresses bring this movie to life; love seeing Taissa Farmiga in this saga.",2023-09-07
"An ""R"" rating works very well here, the visceral demonic Carnage starts off from the very first scene of the film which set the ominous tone . I new straightaway director of The Nun II was going to bring it , so I strapped IN ! The Nun 2 achieves some very interesting and violent death scene and ramps up the Terror. Filmmaker Michael Chaves swung for the fences and it paid off .Do you like a good ""period piece"" because that's what this horror film is .The film was very visually atmospheric with some excellent set design props and period accurate wardrobe.The acting was very solid all around.my only criticism is that the some of the lead actors lacked the proper accents for their roles. This was a bit distracting taking of the immersion of story; Suspension of disbelief is the avoidance--often described as willing--of critical thinking and logic in understanding something that is unreal or impossible in reality, such as something in a work of speculative fiction, in order to believe it for the sake of enjoying its narrative. This being said I can over look it due the solid acting performances from Taissa Farmiga, Jonas Bloquet and an impressive standout role from child actor Katelyn Rose Downey.The Nun II is visually appealing with excellent visceral horror elements , superb cinematography creepy sound effects and film score.Is there a credit scene in The Nun 2? End Credits montage?Yes, there is one mid-credit scene and it's something that avid fans of The Conjuring Universe will likely enjoy. So make sure to watch to the end .End Credits montage.The Nun II offers great scares and expands the highly entertaining Conjuring universe.Summery :
It's 1957, and trouble has come for a boarding school in France. The demon Valek (Bonnie Aarons) has returned to power, with the vicious Nun terrorizing the children and the staff, including teacher Kate (Anna Popplewell) and Maurice (Jonas Bloquet), who previously had a run in with the terrifying evil power. Called into action by the Catholic Church is Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga), who defeated Valek before, tasked with investigating reports of the return. She's paired with Sister Debra (Storm Reid), who's new to the scene, with the twosome setting out to find evidence of Valek's presence and research her new mission of mayhem, trying to understand how The Nun's return is even possible. Answers are difficult to come by, but violence is immediate, with Valek returning to power, stalking the shadows, taking lives as she searches for an ancient relic that could make her a permanent resident.",2023-09-10
"I was a somewhat fan of the original Nun films so I was looking forward to watching The Nun 2.Overall it kept me entertained, however I have to complain the need for the film maker to throw everything at the screen and go over the top.I think its the glowing eyes that get me, it is just not scary. I think keeping things understated works far better than going overboard.All the acting was good. I loved the fact that it was actually filmed on location. I liked the concept of the story line.But towards the end it kind of felt that they were needing to fill in all the blanks and just throwing something in there to finish it off.It has obviously been left for another in the franchise due to who Maurice is in The Conjuring franchise and it won't make sense
unless they drag the Nun out again.Like I said, it was enjoyable to watch.",2023-10-07
"I went into this movie without much expectation and came out pleasantly surprised by how good it turned out to be. Director Michael Chaves salvages the elements of The Nun that really worked and enhances what did not hence the marked improvement on the predecessor. Taissa Farmiga shines as the recurring Sister Irene solidifying her status as a scream queen. Her courage and perseverance are on full display and she carries the movie ably as the lead actress. Jonas Bloquet does a commendable job as Frenchie/Maurice though I missed the comic relief he provided in The Nun. Both he and Irene are the heart of the movie and we cannot help but root for them. Bonnie Aarons gives a delightfully scary performance as Valak the Demon Nun. Among the new characters Storm Reid plays Sister Debra who is practically Irene's sidekick. Katelyn Rose Downey portrays the child Sophie and Anna Popplewell is Kate, Sophie's mother and Frenchie/Maurice's love interest(!). They do a good job as well in their new roles. The storyline is decent. The chilling score adds to the atmospheres and enhances the overall experience.",2023-09-08

I liked this one a bit more than the first one, but i also liked the first one (i didn't understand the hate for it). In the first movie, valak didn't had much screentime because she was more mysterious. And in this movie she had more screentime and i liked that. I also really liked the newspaper scene.I definetly recommend this movie to others. I liked it so i give it 7,8/10.Rated r: supernatural content, violence, gore, language.",2023-09-16
"I find myself and perhaps the only one, surprisingly preferring the first installment. In the first part, everything was new, less predictable and thus more interesting.The second installment, although better in some ways, was too predictable, resulting in less excitement.Despite everything, the Conjuring series remains my favorite horror movie franchise and it is doing quite well so far. I hope the original Warren couple will be back and this time in a much better movie than their last edition.If you are a fan of the series, do watch it. However, if you are watching it randomly, it might not make much sense.",2023-10-08
"Some irrelevant and superfluous plot lines float around inside a convent school loaded with formulaic bog standard jump scares which are loosely tied to the first movie.Is it me or does James Wan not like women very much? Why is the recurring vengeful female a recurring presence in his films?Expect long dark corridors, loads of negative space, creepy music, creaking doors and that annoying pause that indicates something ""scary"" is about to happen.A good horror film for people that don't watch very much horror. I mostly hated it. I liked the magazine rack scene though, that was sort of clever.",2023-09-10
"2.5 out of 5 stars.The Nun 2 is a pretty bad supernatural horror film that tries the predictable of building tension and scares by having character's walking in dark hallways. And corridors with something that may jump out at them. Or seeing strange dark shadows. The direction is losing its touch in building scares and thrills.The plot is boring. It continues with the demonic nun which is possessing a new church and characters are trying to find a way to stop it.The acting is decent. Has the same two main characters and a couple of new additions.The film spends a lot of time with characters walking in dark hallways and trying to build tension. Which is boring. The climax is thrilling at least. And will have you on edge of your seat. But you have a sit through hours worth of boredom.Overall, it is one forgettable horror film. There is a mid credit scene hinting for another film.",2023-09-12
"The Nun 2 was a masterpiece but largely varied from the first. Irene is back as well as Frenchie after their epic show down with the demon Valak. This time sister Irene is happily living in a nunnery with another young nun who likes to smoke pot on the balcony. Sister Irene is shown to have no emotional trauma from the events at St Carta Monastery. Frenchie is now living as a handy man at a boarding school harbouring a dark secret or should I say someone's harbouring a dark entity. Irene and Deborah travel to the locations of supernatural events only to Leah back to Frenchy and the school. The scares were great but the location wasn't so well done. The first offered an isolated abbey, inescapable and haunted as well as a big ass twist. The fact that no one can hear u scream scared me. The movie was great and well excuted and would watch again.",2023-09-08
"Five years after Sister Irene miraculously defeated the demon nun of St. Carta in Romania, she is once again approached by the church in the hope of another miracle. This time, she is tasked to investigate the mysterious murders happening across Europe that are linked to the demon nun 'Valak'. With a new companion Sister Debra, will Sister Irene succeed in repeating history or Valak win the game this time?The Nun (2018) is considered one of the weakest films in the Conjuring franchise. Where the first film was directed by Corin Hardy, the studio trusted the hands of Michael Chaves this time, who previously helmed The Curse of La Llorona (2019) and The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It (2021), for the studio and the franchise. The sequel brings back Taissa Farmiga and Jonas Bloquet as Sister Irene and Maurice and of course Bonnie Aarons as Valak, with the addition of a few fresh characters played by Storm Reid, Katelyn Rose Downey, and Kate Anna Popplewell.Learning from the criticisms of its predecessor, The Nun II tried to improvise a lot. Undoubtedly, it's better in almost every aspect than the first film, but at the same time, that was not the real challenge for the makers, was it? The good thing is that the film is actually well-made and has some incredible sequences that facilitate keeping the viewers engaged the whole time. The film gets better treatment in terms of cinematography and set pieces, with a more cohesive storyline compared to its predecessor.The film effectively uses sound to scare and create a haunting atmosphere when combined with fantastic cinematography. Not all the jump scares work but a few do and none of them feels cheap this time around. The opening scene raises the bar high. The addition of the goat demon was an excellent choice. That's it for this new monster, won't reveal much about it. The film has enough emotional weight to make viewers feel more attached to the characters this time. The performances are likeable, especially that of Taissa Farmiga, who is my absolute favourite in this film. The rest of the cast is great as well and does a wonderful job.Keeping the ups and downs of the first two acts aside, the third act of the film is surprisingly menacing. It's grand and spreads a sense of vulnerability. A scene within the film and the mid-credit scene once again tries to establish a tie with the conjuring films, although it's not clear how and up to what extent. Still, post-credits are always a delight for fans.Coming to the negatives, my biggest criticism is the overexposure and closeup shots of Valak, which do not necessarily invoke fear but make her less effective as the story advances. That doesn't mean that the demonic Nun have a lot of screentime. Once again, the film doesn't give much insight into Valak's origin, which leaves us a little bit unsatisfied at the end. There are little to no surprises in the film's storyline. Chave's direction is improving with every outing, but still, he has not completely mastered the art of using jump scares with greater effectiveness.In conclusion, The Nun II is an enjoyable entry in the Conjuring universe that exceeded my expectations. The film is visually rich and better than many other films of this universe with a more intriguing storyline. It's not the scariest film of the year but it's worth a watch. If you are invested in this spooky universe, you should definitely check it out. The film leaves us with a lot to intrigue about the future of the universe as well as how Valak ended up in The Conjuring 2 after all this.",2023-09-17
"I actually was not a fan of the first ""The Nun"". Far too predictable, cheap scares, and quite frankly boring. This installment was a welcome surprise!I was not expecting anything spectacular, but I was pleasantly surprised. The story isn't anything to write home about, but it's passable. Great tension building for the scares, good set design, and excellent kills.There are some beautiful shots in this movie, which I was really surprised by. The acting is fine. I do have a few issues with the third act of the film, though. The macguffin is a pretty silly, and the climax is sort of a letdown.Overall, a much better installment than the first.",2023-09-18
"Shot in near darkness for the most of its length, ""The Nun II"" has nothing much going for it aside from the iconic face of the mysterious nun that serves for a few good jump-scares. Most of the film though is semi-visible rooms with girls screaming their heart out for no real good reason.The director, Michael Chaves, throwing us into scenes that challenges us to decipher whether they are really happening, some sort of a vision or a glimpse from the past, but not in a way that gives flow to the movie, but in a rather torturous way for the viewer. Adding to that the fact that most images are extremely dark it is really not an entertaining watch.There are some scenes where a glimpse of originality and interest is sparkling, but they are soon faded into blackness and cheap jump-scares, up until the ""Big fight"" in the end which leads to a very predictable and mundane ending. That's too bad since the lead actors are doing a decent job here, but there is not much these actors could do with this kind of sub-par story and direction.If that was an attempt of a film-noir horror it had failed on both accounts. It's not original and not scary at all. I'm not sure who would enjoy this movie, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone I respect. Exact score: 44 / 100.",2023-10-19
Great character building. Some scares you know are coming yet they manage to make you jump anyways. Gross Roaches. They repulsed me the most with the surround sound clickings of all their little nasty legs. Some good Action chase scenes. Extra creepy Catholic Church lore concerning Martyrdom and holy relics. Awesome Devil-Demon-Goat-Beast. I wanted to see more of him. Overall a pretty good movie. Had a good back story that made sense for the franchise. Had some Exorcist like moments. Would be interesting to see a crossover with the Excorsist. Some good gore and special effects. Worth the watch.,2023-09-13

"Some of my mates get pretty excited about this and together we go for this. Except for some nice building architecture and beautiful face, sad to say... just junk, like some B class movie. Some settings seems out of the era and feel weird. Just for curiousity sake, I sit for an hour, giving a little hope, but it's really boring and I just google, read the summary then exited the hall before I get myself bored till death. Scary? No, just the silent then sudden sound combo and which is kinda predictable. Maybe for kids, but I would not recommend so, because it's really junk. Better off watch Paws Patrol.",2023-10-04
"Well the first Nun was not that good either, but this one felt even flatter. Mediocre script with nothing interesting happening and extremely predictable.Sound was a HUGE disapointment. The movie was Atmos (which was noticable in exactly 1 scene near the end, ""steps from the upper level"") , but you feel that even the normal surround here was non-existing. I mean yeah, there is a surround, but it's more like ambient sound, nothing really happened there, nothing to make your head turn back to see what's crawling behing or anything.... The surround sound was worse than many B-movies i've seen. Even the bass was meh in many scenes where it could have been much better (and for anyone who'd say that i need better Subwoofers - dual SVS PB1000 Pro can give enough punch for the whole range down to 18Hz). Someone just have decided to cut money on sound even when sound is dirt cheap nowadays if i rely on the results that many cheap movies have.One good thing? Sure - cinematography was not bad, pretty dark but properly lit , and with nice color tones and editing. VFX are as good as before i.e. Not bad but nothing impressive.Definitely one of the weakest movies in the franchaise, but it's not surprising - you can't milk this to infinity.",2023-10-08
"A sequel to a prequel may not sound enticing. In fact it may sound downright dreadful!Thanks to the solid script, spot on direction, and excellent cast ""The Nun II"" is focused, engaging, and honestly frightening at times (and I am a vet of horror films since a boy and do not say that lightly).Taissa Farmiga is once again perfectly cast as Sister Irene. Tucked away after the events of the first film into a small convent by the Vatican (while her male co-exorcist is given a Bishop's title!), she lives humbly and never speaks of her involvement. That is until the Vatican comes calling on her again to investigate what appears to be a return of the demon she helped vanquish.Toss in Maurice from the first film and a perfect continuance is underway.New characters shine. Nice to see ""Chronicles of Narnia"" Anne Poppelwell in a big screen project. Her and her daughter, played by a wonderful Katelyn Rose Downey, makes for a perfect pair to connect to where the demon nun has set her sites on.As prior, a rare holy relic is sought and required to do it's supernatural work. It is the only thing that makes me concerned for the future of the franchise. If there is to be another sequel and the formula of Christian relics is employed, what are they going to use?? A saints heart? Liver??",2023-10-07
"This was a predictable paint by numbers horror movie. Which was completely unexpected and disappointing. Usually the quality in this series is above and beyond. It's one of my favorite series... Not this time Despite the over abundance of jump scares in this movie I only jumped once. That being a moment when something slid across the floor after falling. It was the second jump scare in two seconds that surprised me, but that's not exactly fear.Now Spoilers:
The main problem this movie had was its predictability. A boy pushes the ball into a dark room, turns his back and a few seconds later the ball comes back. Everyone saw it coming. Knowing what's coming isn't scary. It's the unknown that's scary. If the ball had rolled into the other room and something else had rolled back like a bottle or a piece of chalk, that would have been interesting and helped build suspense and curiosity. Especially if it hadn't shown the Nun.That was the other thing they did wrong. The Nun was everywhere. In every other scene. It was like, ""Hey in case you forgot, the nun is the one haunting them and causing creepy stuff to happen. This is the Nun by the way."" Only the only creepy things that happened were with the Nun in view. There was honestly only one scene I liked where the little girl was following her up the steps thinking she was her mom and then she turned into the wall fungus painting thing. That was actually nicely done. I also liked the magazine racks but it was a little overdone, that was one scene where shortening it might have helped. It got to this point where I was like, ""I get it, you're going to shoe the Nun, get on with it already."" It took so long it was boring, and again the Nun didn't have to be looming over her shoulder as she watched it appear on the pages. Going back to the beginning with the ball, having her appear before the boy was like saying, ""Oh, in case you didn't know, it was the nun that rolled the ball back."" It was unnecessary. The movie is called The Nun 2, we know who did it. It's like Stephen King says, once you see the monster it loses its power over you, and this is one monster that wouldn't stop showing her face.There was a lot more physical interaction in this movie than there were in the first one. The Nun threw things across the room, bludgeoned someone, knocked over statues, and was downright overpowered all while possessing a guy. The original move was all about the psychological aspects of horror, and while it wasn't the best in the series, it was suspenseful and still better than most other horror movies out there. It tested the nuns faith to see how strong it was. This one felt more like, Hulk Smash. It's the difference between the Superman in the comics vs. The Super Man in the movies who solves everything with his fists. To simplify that: Very little thought went into this one and it shows. Example: Having the nun take the form of the little boy to kill his mother was predictable from the moment they mentioned he died in there. When it happened it was more like, ""Oh, it finally happened."" There was no tension built up, no suspense, and it wasn't a very creative way for her to go. This could have been better if: 1.) she'd been slammed around by the demon and taken away by people in white coats the next day. This could have also added a contracting moment of amusement where the bullies think they've driven her crazy and reflect on their actions and or celebrate. Or 2.) She has a story arch involving finding faith again and uses it to protect the bullies who have secretly been tormenting her. Thereby giving the bullies a chance at a redemption arch that can leave the audience feeling satisfied once it's complete. In case this isn't understood the bullies would need to apologize for what they've done wrong. This could even happen after one is injured to add a little drama, but that might be laying it on a bit thick.Which brings me back to the lack of horror in this horror movie. Every jump scare was preceded by silence which brought me all the way back to early nineties horror movies where you knew something was about to jump out at you because it got super quiet. One of the main things I love about this series is how it teased at these things but never spoon feeds them to you in the way you expect. They usually have a creative twist. I'm going to state this again in case I forgot: Jump scares aren't scary. Being surprised is not the same as being afraid. Yelling Boo! Is not equal to a slow tension build up. I get they happen in horror movies, but it shouldn't be the go-to thing where every minute there's at least one. It's like getting punched in the same spot on repeat, eventually it's just going to go numb.Then there's the injuries. One of the bullies takes a horn through the door. This might have been more impactful if we actually cared about the character, it would have built tension in seeing someone likeable or loved in pain. This could have been solved in a couple different ways. By, having the bullies see the head mistress being carried out and showing remorse for leaving the little girl in there. Maybe even getting a genuine apology out of them so they seemed more like people and less like caricatures. Then when she gets the horn through the arm we'd actually feel something. In this case, I literally just sighed and rolled my eyes because of course it was her.I know I just touched on this but, there was also poor character development, at the end I was wondering why the other nun was even there. There was a nice arch lined up for her to discover her faith, and a great set up for her to stand up to the devil while she was protecting the kids. To use her faith to keep them safe, but it didn't happen. Instead, we got this weak moment after she sees the nun put the fire out where she states, ""That was a miracle."" Cue internal screaming. This should go without saying but witnessing a miracle does not mean a person has faith. Showing a person something doesn't mean they believe in it. To quote the elf from The Santa Clause, ""Seeing isn't believing, believing is seeing."" Not finishing this character arch properly left her with no agency. Basically you paid a great actress to be there and say lines for no reason.The next issue was that it spoon fed us everything. At one point a guy in the library asks them, ""Did you ever think it might be a fallen angel?"" As if the hint of the goat and the fact they've run into Beelzebub in other movies wasn't hint enough. The more you know about a thing the less scary it becomes. When I was a kid I always covered my eyes during scary movies, but if I had been brave enough to look I would have found out that it was never as bad as the things I imagined. Let your viewers use their imagination a little.I feel like I'm being really hard on this movie, but this is one of my favorite series because I am a particularly difficult person to scare normally, and this series has crafted some of the few movies that have been able to frighten me. They keep one foot in reality and that was where this one went completely off the rails. It was so much in the fantasy world that it didn't feel even remotely real.Another note, there was a little bit too much fake blood in the teeth. Unnecessary teeth weirdness. It hit a point where the nuns teeth weren't creepy or scary but just weird. I'm going to restate this but the less we saw of the nun the scarier she was, so long as we were seeing the influence she had on the world around her. Horror movies should be sublet in nature until they aren't.I certainly hope these mistakes aren't repeated in the next movie, and I volunteer as tribute to watch and critique it before it's released to the public. Please don't make these mistakes again. This series is better than that. It's one of the only two, possibly three movies series out there that are actually scary... or at least the majority of them are at this point. 8 out of 9 are scary.",2023-09-08
"Go watch this in premium format! And if you're a bit apprehensive like me, consider watching it during the day. Let me share a little backstory - I'm not usually a fan of horror films at all, so you might wonder why I decided to watch it in the first place. Well, a few years ago, when the first Nun movie was released, my little sister didn't have anyone to accompany her. So, I was voluntold. I ended up sitting through it and, to my surprise, enjoyed it. The audience in the theater that day had a blast, and popcorn was flying everywhere.Since then, I've become a fan of this cinematic universe. As you can imagine, I was a bit lost initially because that was the only film I had seen. It was like jumping into the Avengers without watching the previous movies that led up to it. So, I decided to dive into this series, watching all the movies that came before it and catching the newer releases on opening weekends. Now, I am fully invested in this series, and watching 'The Nun 2' was an absolute delight! The crowd that was with me was totally into it as well.It was a creepy, creepy, creepy delight, I must admit. While I found the first Nun movie slightly better, this new entry did not disappoint. It was more brutal and unsettling, but there was something about the nuns and their actions in the first one that was truly disturbing. 'The Nun 2' continues to build on the lore of the characters and their universe, making it feel like an event movie, like the Avengers or Star Wars films. I cannot wait to see what happens next.Oh, and there's a surprising mid-credit scene that you shouldn't miss. Overall, great flick!",2023-09-12
"No pun intended - the Conjuring universe gets bigger and bigger. And this is a direct sequel to the other Nun movie. With returning character/actors. I assume you have seen the other movie at least (maybe even be savvy in the CU as some like to call it).If you are the latter, you will realize that the main character here, looks a lot like the main one in the Conjuring .. surprise surprise: they are related! I thought it might have been her/Veras daughter ... but apparently it is her sister! She is not the only returning character though! And even if you have forgotten about them, the movie will remind you.The effects are good, the shockers are well placed ... and it seems it hits a chord with a lot of folks. Box-office wise that is. Stick after the end for a bonus scene ... which hints at something ... and maybe if you have a keen eye you will be able to see some easter eggs across the movie ...",2023-09-28
"Michael Chaves did an exquisite job putting together the writing of Ian Goldberg and Richard Naing. This team of creators has definitely taken The Nun to the next level. Mr. Chaves also, did a far better job developing the jump scares in this movie compared to his previous work with The Conjuring: The Devil made me do it.I definitely enjoyed The Nun, but I did feel it dropped the ball delivering on the scares. This however has a great balance of scares and storyline and it of course is left open for a third movie if they choose to make one. I personally hope they do make a third movie because like everything else in The Conjuring universe... I'm in love.",2023-09-09
"I was really disappointed by the first Nun movie, but I'm glad I watched this one. It offers a decent story, some thrilling jumps, and a couple eerily-cool and original-feeling sequences that stay with you after viewing. I think leaning more heavily into Catholic lore and history was a great choice by the writers that made Valak feel more ancient, more plausible, and more menacing. This is easily the best of (director) Michael Chaves' films in The Conjuring universe to date. His eye for the disturbing and his ability to create a cohesive and compelling tone have gotten keener. The film is also elevated by some solid performances from the cast, particularly Jonas Bloquet (Maurice) and Suzanne Bertish (Madame Laurent.) The Nun II is a sequel worth your time.",2023-09-15
"The 2018 horror movie ""The Nun"" utterly failed to entertain me, even though the movie's premise was rather interesting and the trailer looked really great. But writers Gary Dauberman and James Wan, as well as director Corin Hardy failed to deliver a rather interesting movie. So I have to admit that I was by no means looking forward to ""The Nun II"" when I initially saw the trailer for it in the cinema.And I was in no hurry to get to watch ""The Nun II"", and thus only got around to it now.Writers Ian Goldberg, Richard Naing and Akela Cooper delivered an amazingly boring and utterly pointless script and storyline to carry on the legacy from the 2018 movie. It was actually every bit as boring and bad as the 2018 first movie was. But hey, at least they carried at the same level as the first movie.Sure, the acting performances in ""The Nun II"" were fair enough. And while actress Bonnie Aarons returns to reprise The Demon Nun character, then it should be said that she was almost hardly in the movie at all.You have to wait 80 minutes into the movie before anything worthwhile and interesting happens. I kid you not; 80 long minutes. And truth be told, by then it was just simply too little, too late, and the movie had totally lost its momentum and scare power.Visually, then I will say that ""The Nun II"" was okay, at least that was something that spoke on the movie's behalf. But visual effects could do only so much for a movie that sank faster than a ship in 1912.I was not entertained by director Michael Chaves' 2023 sequel ""The Nun II"" to the 2018 movie ""The Nun"".My rating of ""The Nun II"" lands on a three out of ten stars.",2023-10-05
"""The Nun 2"" had a lot of potential, but it ultimately falls short of the expectations set by its predecessor. While the film offers some genuinely spooky moments and maintains a consistent atmosphere of dread, it struggles to live up to the high standards of modern horror cinema.One of the film's strengths is its visual presentation. The cinematography is excellent, with dark and moody shots that effectively create a sense of foreboding. The eerie and gothic setting is well-crafted, and the film makes good use of religious iconography to build a sense of unease.However, the story fails to fully engage the audience. It feels disjointed at times, with a plot that meanders and relies too heavily on jump scares to maintain tension. The characters are underdeveloped, and their motivations often remain unclear, making it difficult to invest emotionally in their fates.The titular character, Valak, still manages to be a formidable and menacing presence, thanks in large part to a stellar performance by the actress. Yet, even Valak's appearances become somewhat predictable, and the fear factor wanes as the film progresses.The script also struggles with pacing issues, as it takes a while for the story to gain momentum, and the climax feels rushed and lacks the impact that it should have had. Additionally, some plot twists and revelations come across as contrived rather than genuinely surprising.On a positive note, ""The Nun 2"" does try to expand the lore of the ""Conjuring"" universe and shed more light on the origins of Valak. Fans of the franchise may appreciate these efforts to connect the dots, even if they are not executed as effectively as they could have been.In the end, ""The Nun 2"" is a decent horror film with some redeeming qualities, but it fails to capture the same level of terror and intrigue as its predecessor. It's worth a watch for fans of the series or the horror genre in general, but it falls short of becoming a standout entry in the ""Conjuring"" universe.",2023-10-05

"Well, well, well,....
I really like the first Nun....so lets keep this in mind. It was original scary and new. Many times we struggle with sequels and this is no exception. All I remember is maybe Spiderman 2,,can you tell me of another ?Anyway, I wasn't expecting so much so I kinda wasn't that disappointed! It tries to expand the Nun universe but does it work? Is it needed? Ummm.....is it even scary? They tried but there's nothing new here. I dont think the cgi is better here,neither. Yes, we know more about the nun demon ,the actors are doing their best and the cinematography is beautiful but there's something missing here!",2023-10-20
If you want some better jumps and scares watch something like drag me to hell. Or ust something else anything else. Through all this hoopla for 2 and 1/2 hours The demon was going to become all-powerful and unstoppable. If it got the eyes. Don't let it get the eyes. The eyes of St Lucy or something. And of course gets the eyes and then they defeated by praying and throwing wine on it. They could have done that from the very beginning. What stop them from praying and throwing wine. Why not acid or something that sounds more lethal? But in the end I'm sure there will be part three. Oh boy can't wait.,2023-09-08
"One of the most enigmatic demons in the Conjuroverse is undoubtedly The Nun. She first appeared in The Conjuring 2 and is a disturbing character with a lot to eat.Her first film, About Her, is frankly very bad. A weak script narrated clumsily. Despite having solvent actors like Demián Bichir and Charlotte Hope.The producers, aware that the character deserved a better movie, made an effort in this sequel and delivered a worthy product. Which could not be described as a horror film.Rather, it is a supernatural thriller with a good narrative rhythm, good locations and great cinematography.It is the nun Irene, the only survivor of the previous installment, who is entrusted by the Vatican to face this demon in human form that has moved from Eastern Europe to France, leaving death, desolation and fear in its wake among the parishioners. For his attack on priests.Taissa Farmiga, sister of Vera Farmiga who plays Lorraine Warren in The Conjuring films, makes the saying well: ""for the wedge to tighten it must be of the same suit.""
Her work is credible. She is a fragile nun in body but strong in will, moved by her faith.The script has an interesting aspect worth noting: the evil entity has arrived in France, looking for a relic of spiritual power, the eyes of Lucia of Syracuse. Patron saint of the blind. This saint was burned alive by the pagans in times of strong persecution of the Christians in the year 304, before doing so they gouged out her eyes. Despite the fire and burning wood, her body remained incorrupt. She without any injury. Later then, her eyes were hidden in a monastery as a symbol of spiritual strength.That is why the devil, like a fallen angel, longs to have them. Looking maybe for some light.The film is not a masterpiece by any means, but it manages to make up for the poor and lousy first installment, providing quality entertainment.There is a post-credits scene. Taking a look at what's to come for the Warrens.",2023-09-08
"""The Nun II"" is a superior film to the first part released in 2018, but not outstanding, only vaguely better. The script has positive and negative moments, the film starts well but from the middle it becomes tedious except for a couple of scenes, the most notable scene is somewhat unnecessary and out of place in the story, this aforementioned scene is that of the devil in the form of a goat that manages to capture interest, on the other hand the short scene of the Warrens does not add anything to the plot and also includes an illogical and not very credible ending. The cinematography is good, the atmosphere is gloomy and it takes advantage of the filming locations in that abbey turned into a boarding school. The music composed for the film does not achieve tension and goes unnoticed. The cast puts in good performances. The work of the director of the film could have been better. A strong negative point are the digital effects that look unrealistic and poor quality. A film with a promising beginning but then it goes into a tailspin, managing to give one or another salvageable scene.",2023-09-07
"This movie gets a better fundamental narrative, by introducing two stories that emerged during the end with a good action sequence of terror.First we have the nuns, the good ones of course, and their encounter with the mysterious deaths that they pointed of a problem unresolved.Secondly there is the boarding school of girls that keeps another mystery, with a strange fellow in their midst.So here it's fine, the big problem is the ""bad"" nun, and I mean BAD, because it is very obvious when she's going to appear, every time, and the worst part is that she always do the same thing. It's predictable and annoying. This movie has been so much better without the screaming nun.",2023-09-24
"""The Nun 2"" immerses viewers in iconic Catholic imagery with every scene, reminiscent of a dark and eerie version of Sunday School that might just send young children running back to church. Ironically, the predominantly school-aged audience I watched it with reacted much like a spirited crowd from the 1950s, with hoots, comments, and even the occasional yell. It was a unique and enjoyable experience, almost like reliving ""happy days.""One standout aspect of the film was the appearance of the devil himself, depicted as a large goat-like creature. Personally, I found this character to be a highlight and wished for more of his presence throughout the movie.The movie succeeds in delivering genuine scares, thanks to its blend of nasty Catholic schoolgirls, a zombie-like leading man, and an assortment of ghouls and other terrifying creatures. It truly serves as an effective scare fest that keeps you on the edge of your seat.However, I deducted one star from my rating due to a minor inconsistency: the nuns in the film seemed remarkably unscathed after enduring what appeared to be quite a lot of physical punishment.Overall, ""The Nun 2"" offers a chilling and captivating cinematic experience, particularly for those who appreciate macabre tales intertwined with Catholic imagery. While it may not be without its minor flaws, it succeeds in delivering the scares and thrills that fans of the horror genre seek. If you're in the mood for a dark and eerie cinematic journey, this film is worth a watch.",2023-09-10
"The use of so many horror tropes you could see them coming a mile away. I could almost nap during this movie. The acting was good but plot was super thin and had more holes than Swiss Cheese.When the girls at the school pointed out the wine and then the nuns are talking about miracles in the train, I called the ending and then it took forever to get there.However, the ending makes no sense if the demon was defeated how does it show up in the conjuring? Other than maybe Loraine warren is a descendent like sister Irene is, just jumbled and feels stuffed into the franchise. Glad Frenchy finds a family though and grows tomatoes. Good for him.",2023-10-07
"While the movie itself isn't terrible, there's too many clichés and formulas, and repetitive tropes from the first one to make it stand out. They try some new things here as well, and I believe some of them work at face value, but, you'll have to judge for yourself. Also, STOP shoehorning in black characters JUST BECAUSE. It's stupid, it doesn't make sense, especially in the setting and in the timeline, and literally within the first five minutes of the movie, we get to hear about how bad white people are how and racial injustice is. I am sick and damn tired of hearing about it, and I am guaranteeing you 90% of moviegoers are as well. Enough already. Maybe the social justice nonsense should stop and the creativity should start. The movie isn't a failure, but, unfortunately, with the predictability and pandering, this can't exceed an average rating.",2023-10-11
"The Conjuring Universe has never been known for putting out masterpieces, but with each installment, the quality falls further and further. The Nun 2 is the newest installation of the franchise and it stays par for the course. Taking place in 1956, we are treated to another boring adventure for our Nun hunters. While there are some interesting moments, the titular Nun maintains her role as a 2002 Youtube jump scare and fails to achieve any memorable moments for herself. The best moments in the film come from the Devil, in the form of a terrifying goat, hellbent on murder. Aside from that, the rest of the film consists of dry conversations and exposition that feels forced down your throat with incredibly stiff dialogue. This is all topped off by a laughable mid-credit scene that just exists to remind you that the Warren's exist and will unfortunately return. Another forgettable installation to a franchise which should've taken itself more seriously or quit long ago.",2023-10-02
"I really didn't enjoy the first Nun film very much. It wasn't terribly scary, well-written, or necessary. Of course WB, attempting to milk the Conjuring franchise for every last drop, commissioned a sequel. While I did find this film to have a little sturdier foundation, it still doesn't amount to much by the end. It all feels quite meaningless, especially when the scares don't exactly skyrocket one's heart rate. The horror aspect is slightly better, though I still wouldn't call it exemplary.I'm sure there will be another sequel given the ominous ending, but maybe it's time to stop making spin-off films solely off of one note villains and objects.",2023-10-06
"...but the first three quarters of the film was well done. The ending was a little too wild for me. Too much display of power on the part of the demon. The actors were wonderful, the back ground was awesome and the storyline had potential. But they just went a little too far with the ending. Some creative ideas were incorporated in the sequel, but for the most part it reminded me of the action adventure superhero movies where too much razzle dazzle show of strength can ruin a film. It wasn't a creepy nail biter like 'Lights Out', and according to testimonies from real exorcists, no demon can do that many 'show of strength' stunts. It was fun to see in the theater, but I can't recommend renting it some day for those that haven't seen it.",2023-09-23
"Wow, what a 180 compared to its predecessor.Aside from (most of) the returning characters, much of what made the first film an underrated gem is missing: Good pacing, character building, mix of jump scares and atmospheric suspense, a good ending, and so much more. The first movie compares very much to IT or Sinister, whereas this movie is very forgettable, like Sinister 2 or La Llarona.Yes, there was a Sinister 2, and no, you don't need to see it.I gave the Nun2 a score of a 4/10 because there were still some scenes that were shot nicely, and the main cast did a solid job acting out the screenplay and vocalizing the dialogue, for which both were dryer than the sahara, so a chore they were.Missed opportunities include: Building a better connection between the nun and Irene, building a better connection between Irene's past and the climax, adding new character arcs (like Father Burke dealing with his bishop-title and having an Icarus moment, or Irene dealing with her first major encounter with a demon and now considering joining the church as an exorcist/specialist like Lorraine Warren), or having Debra (new nun side-kick) do anything substantial.Regarding Debra, I'm pretty sure they had more for this character to help contribute to the plot, maybe even a character arc with her reclusive attitude towards the structure of confession. Unfortunately, in the final cut, you can take this person out of the movie and nothing even mildly-substantial would be effected, and that's a massive shock as she's somewhere in nearly every scene with Irene or the boarding school girls.Frenchie and Irene are solid characters and are good complimenting personalities and professions, but the script gives everyone a bland sandwich to work with, so they could've shined even brighter.The connection to St. Lucy was outta nowhere. I'm pretty sure a different Saint/Relic could be used that fit the story/Irene's background better. I liked the eyes and some homage to the saints, but it doesn't fit as well here.Every suspense scene was finished with a jump scare. That is not good, and a cheap horror trick. The entire Conjuring Universe was built off the heroes'/demons' character-building, the Warren's part in the stories, and a great mix of jump scares and suspenseful build-ups. Make every one of those build-ups a jump scare, and you keep losing the audience's investment in the movie.The best part of the movie was the mid-credits scene. I'm excited that Ed and Lorraine (Patrick and Vera) are coming back! They're great actors and fill the characters' statures nicely, both with dialogue and screen presence.",2023-09-07
"If you're looking for a movie that makes you spill some of your popcorn, this is a good one for you. This is definitely a good movie, but maybe not as ""horror"" packed as most would like. It's horror in the sense of jump scares and intensity, but not much ""terror"". My main issue is that The Nun didn't have nearly as much screen time as much as I would have liked, and the appearance of a special someone made no sense to the plot. The movie is entertaining and the cinematography is amazing, but it's definitely a slow builder. I'd watch this again to understand it some more, and it's a definite improvement over the first film.",2023-09-09
"Watched the Nun 2 on first day. Loaded with lot of jump scares, and Last 30 minutes with some real horror.Screenplay is bit slow , but thats what's expected with a movie that is based on atmospheric view. Sets and locations are really good and totally sets of 1956 mood, however it takes some time to build up , and thats where I felt it could have been much tighter. But nevertheless, some scares in between were really good. Starts off like an investigative thriller.All the characters are well played, and goes with the flow.This Nun 2 is much better and spookier than earlier one, with last 30 minutes of horror. Recommended !",2023-09-09
"I absolutely loved this movie. I am sad Father Burke died . The Characters are awesome, frenchie did a fantastic job. This movie started off strong and kept you in your seat the hole time. Everyone did a good job in their roles. Good solid scary movie. I am seeing it back to back today. I think it's that good I wanted to see it again. I hope there is a nun 3 . I really feel like you out did yourself. This was so much better then Nun1 . I feel in love with the Nun character she is my favorite even though that sounds bad. LolI owen all conjuring movies and I can't wait to buy this one. Love it, keep making Nun movies.",2023-09-07
"Another Spinoff from conjuring universe is here and this time it again takes the story of Nun ahead with different type of storyline including with same old characters.One thing I like about this film is that this time director has make sure to present a different story with including many characters and make a proper large scale storyline not like the previous one which just had a small amount of storyline with few actors.TAISAA FARMIGA shines throughout the film her screen presence is a delighito watch with rest of the cast performance was good.Well talking about the main point is this most violent film of conjuring universe ?Answer is NO. Yes it has some cool jumpsacres scenes but that does not makes the movie great because storyline is just average as many typical horror films.The way James Wan has presented the Nun in conjuring 2 I'm sorry to say director has not matched the level with that film infact they connected the same scene with this film which is good to see..
All n all it's an enjoyable horror flick and a lot better than the previous one but still don't expect much.....",2023-09-08
"My love for The Conjuring films is what lead me to watch the first Nun movie. Getting to know & understand the characters behind the stories of other movies can be rather interesting. Unfortunately, the story & the acting lacked a bit in that one. Definitely wasn't a movie that I would care to watch numerous times but still just enough to keep me interested in the sequel. I went into this movie not expecting too much differently but as it kept going I found myself more & more interested. This one was definitely better than the first. It starts off slow but it really starts heating up from the halfway point on. The slow beginning is still interesting enough & helps build the story. Like I stated before. If you liked the first Nun then there's No reason you shouldn't like this one!",2023-09-27
"Way better than the first one in my opinion, some good scares, script is ok. Acting is actually really well executed by the guest actors. The devil is pretty scary portrayed in the movie, the scenery and the setting is nicely done in mid 50s France. The horror genre shifted throughout the years and the makers behind the franchise of the conjuring did a good job in my opinion, with finding a balance between; partly; reality and fiction. The opening scene is quite gore and unexpected for this kind of movies. I saw it in a theater with RPX sound, which was immense! You're going for entertainment, so go see it!",2023-09-12
This movie is absolutely fantastic especially because it's 4 years after the first events and 15 years before the conjuring. We have everything from demons to dead kids to the whereabouts of Maurice and the Sister... it's way better than the first and it actually does pickup where it left off while going full circle back towards the conjuring... that alone made this movie GREAT. People come here giving unrealistic reviews and scores and that pisses me off... if you're an avid horror fan and a fan of the conjuring universe than you will appreciate this movie more than the conjuring 3... this did have the scare factor to it. I always found the nun to be scarier than all the conjuring except for the first 1.... Go watch!,2023-10-04
"I've had a pretty muted response to most of The Conjuring movies overall but I seem to have liked to spin offs more than the main series and I actually liked the first Nun movie more than most so I was interested in this film. Having said that though I hated The Curse of La Llorona, Michael Chaves' first film and thought his Conjuring movie was a pretty drastic step down from the first two films (both of which I don't love to begin with) so his involvement didn't do much to bolster my excitement.Overall though, I actually really enjoyed the Nun II for what it was and I think it's a pretty big step up from the first Nun. Just like the first film I really like the whole gothic aesthetic and religious imagery, it's relentlessly creepy and I actually quite liked the visuals on display. I liked the fact it was a bit more of a mystery than a straight up horror film and since wasn't done all that well for me in The Devil Made Me Do It I thought Chaves improved on that idea a lot more with this film. I think Taissa Farmiga is a pretty underrated actress and I think she's great in here as is Storm Reid as a newcomer and the best part of the first film; the Frenchie character is great once again.The issue lies with some of the pacing. It's essentially 2 films in 1 up until the 3rd act and I think it took a bit too long for both of the plot points to come together. The balance between them wasn't always the most even and it sort of made the film feel directionless for the longest time. I also think there were a few too many scenes that dragged on longer than they needed to. I get the sense that the idea was to build tension but I usually felt a bit more exhausted than gripped when a lot of these scenes reached their climax because the scares just started to lose me after a while. I wouldn't call the first 2 acts grounded but I thought the final third went a little bit too of the rails with what was being set up and it felt a bit too much like a video game boss battle in all the wrong ways.These movies don't always work for me but when they do I do have a fun time with them. The Nun II is imperfect but I absolutely enjoyed myself watching it and I was never bored, something I can't say for Chaves first two films. I would rank this pretty highly in my Conjuring ranking and it has, for the time being at least, reinvigorated my enjoyment of these movies.",2023-09-09
"The Nun 2: Better Than the PreviousThe Conjuring universe expands more with the latest release of The Nun 2. The Nun first appeared in the Conjuring 2. Soon after it got its own movie called The Nun, now comes the sequel to that movie. The Nun 2 is Directed by Michael Chaves, who previously directed The Curse of La LLorona and The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me do It. Returning cast include: Taissa Farmiga, Bonnie Aarons, and Jonas Bloquet. Joining them is Anna Popplewell from The Chronicles of Narnia franchise.After the events of the last Nun movie, everyone thought they defeated Valak. Unfortunately, he's still alive, and possessing someone else to get the eyes of Lilith. Together Irene (Taissa Farmiga), and Debra (Storm Reid) must prevent the Nun from retrieving the eyes and becoming powerful.The first movie was pretty bad, so expectations for this sequel most likely won't be very high. With this sequel having some substance to the plot, it makes the movie at least better than the previous.The mystery that Irene and Debra have to solve involves figuring out who and what the Nun wants, was interesting enough to watch. The other storyline involves Sophie (Katelyn Rose Downey) in her school, where the Nun and the eyes of Lilith are locked away in a forbidden room. In the end both storylines come together and connects the movie to the Conjuring universe. The Nun 2 is better than the first movie yet it's still forgettable.",2023-09-11
"I give 5 stars just because I love Bonnie Aarons. But seriously there where moments that I was thinking, "" where is the nun?"" I wanted more Bonnie Aarons. I want a nun move that is actually about the nun. Give us her story how she turned from angel to demon. We want more of her. No one cares Tessa Farmiha. People go to the movies to watch the nun. Give us her story. I feel a bit disappointed also seeing how they turned this movie into a monster movie rather than keeping it suspense like the conjuring movies where the stories are so personal and you actually see yourself in these stories. I wish THE NuN 3 will actually be The Nun's story.",2023-09-09
"When it comes to horror flicks, few things that should be considered aside from the plot and character development are scary scenes, jump scares, the music, the timing and how scary the movie really is. Did this movie live up to those expectations? Yes and no.No in the sense that some scenes are already expected to be scary and most of the jump scares are already expected to come in like you already know that the next scene will be a jump scare. The whole movie though was quite a scary ride. And it could be better if you'll watch it with a faint of heart.And yes it did live up to the expectations because the design, the setting, the sound mixing added horror to this movie. The ensemble cast was good too and the story was able to explain how the movie would go. Although one thing to point out is that this movie could have been a mystery movie and not a horror one if the elements of what makes a horror movie was omitted. Overall, it was still a good horror movie and way, way better than the latest chapter of Insidious.The Nun 2 is 7 (or at this point, 7.5) over 10 for me. Worth watching in the cinema.Plus notes to seeing Anna Popplewell again and the ending showing that prayer in Christ is the most powerful tool is an amazing touch.",2023-09-17
"Yesterday I went to the cinema to watch the new ""THE NUN 2"" movie, and I was surprised, to say the least!The movie is quite good, for a few reasons. It gives a good recap of the first movie (THE NUN,2018) and it does so in a way that doesn't feel as if you're recycling scenes, unlike the other movies where a recap is quite monotonous.We get more backstory on sister Irene and the new cast is also interesting to watch.The kills in this movie are unique and logically connected to one another. None of the deaths are random (you'll realise why when you watch the movie).The pacing is great, although initially everything seems scattered.What I truly enjoyed most about this movie is how it, in a way, connects all the Conjuring Universe movies. We realise where Lorraine's psychic abilities come from; same goes for sister Irene. (insignificant spoiler: we realise that sister Irene and Lorraine Warren are connected)
We also see what happened to Morris (aka Francie). We also get a little history lesson which is always nice. As I previously mentioned, the kills are connected and when sister Irene confronts Valak we see a prime example that demonstrates Valak's intellect as it tries to kill sister Irene in a very 'special' way. (PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO ALL THE HISTORY SCENES THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE, THEY TRULY DO COME IN HANDY)
We also get to see how one of the most iconic and recognisable scenes of the conjuring is incorporated in this movie (once again, if you're a fan of the conjuring universe you'll realise what I mean if you see the movie)
As most movies that are part of this universe, there's never just 1 ""villain"" that you have to deal with. Let me clarify:
In The conjuring 2, we had to deal with valak but also with the crooked man.Same thing happens here. And this ""demon"" (obviously controlled by Valak) is actually terrifying!One of my favourite scenes is during the final confrontation when Valak seems to have won. There's a part where we get to see a sight of holiness and unholiness combined together to create the most terrifying yet, in a way, mesmerising figure I've ever seen on a horror movie.One other good thing is that there are some glimmers of humor sprinkled here and there, not overdone, though.The thing which I don't like about this movie is that sometimes it seems (towards the end) too fictional. I also don't like how Valak takes some ""dumb"" decisions making it seem less powerful when we all know Valak is ""the main boss of the conjuring franchise"".To sum up, I think THE NUN 2 is a very interesting movie and it definitely is a good watch!",2023-09-10
"I think that after spending time at Saint Carthas Monastery, working with sister Irene and the nuns from the Romanian nunury, I've learned so much about my third eye and the power of being apart of the church. Now I do feel that Sister Irene was under much stress during this process and that her time spent could've been put at better use, but she has to do what she had to do to safe Maureece.It was lovely meeting Sofia and her mother, but I felt so bad for all those children at the school whom are going to be severely traumatized following those horrific and tantalizing events that pool place.",2023-09-09
"The original Nun was a bit overhyped and boring so I thought they had a low bar to rise above; they lowered it further.The demon can supposedly kill people randomly from a distance, yet can't find a small girl hiding behind a barrel. Needs to possess Frenchie to kill some people but also can kill on its own. Is the greatest evil they've faced, yet is deathly allergic to alcohol.Don't even get me started on the fact that a tiny Nun could track down a person who was at every place a death occurred, but the police were baffled.It's upsetting that people prioritize jump scares and special effects over continuity and cohesive storytelling. In horror the biggest no-no is making the 'bad guy' unbeatable at the start and then too easily beaten.",2023-10-13
"I think the movie producers and directors saw alot of previous reviews for the first movie; stating that Valak didn't get enough screen time in the first movie. Boy did she show herself this go round! She was a straight menace to society and I just loved every second of it! The scary nun take is honestly the best paranormal horror out right now besides the other Conjuring movies. Her look is just everything, especially when you're religious and it's like throwing salt on a snail when looking at her lol. They enhanced her look in this one, just when I thought she couldn't look more terrifying! It's all in the eyes! They also did a great job with the 60s ish setting of the film. It really added to the ambiance that's necessary to these types of horror flicks. There were some comical parts for sure and I like how far they took the whole being possessed idea. It enhanced the film and gave the second movie the ummph the first one desperately needed. However, I didn't like how cheesy the ending was, but I'll leave it at that! Maybe in the next film, they can incorporate the Warrens into the storyline! I think that will take The Nun franchise to a different level! Overall, this movie did exactly what it was supposed to for me personally! Money well spent and my eyes will always be glued for any future movie in the Conjuring universe! It was also so good seeing the actor who played Lucy from The Chronicles of Narnia, that was a real treat!Atmosphere 6 Setting 7 Storyline 6 cast 7.",2023-09-09
"The Nun II continues with the story of Sister Irene(Taissa Farmiga), after the events of The Nun(2018). In 1956, in a town in France, many gruesome murders are taking place. Sister Irene has to once again go toe to toe with The Demon Nun(Bonnie Aarons), to put an end to her reign of terror.The Nun II is a pretty good film. However, it had the potential to be great. Director Michael Chaves has given us another movie in The Conjuring universe, with such wasted potential. The same thing happened with the Chaves directorial, The Curse of La Llorona(2019). His only good film in this ever expanding horror universe is, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It(2021). The jump scares are super predictable. There's literally only one creepy scene, in the whole movie. The last half an hour of the movie is just pure chaos & is unintentionally funny, at times. The visual effects are apt. Taissa Farmiga is spectacular as Irene. Jonas Bloquet is superb as Maurice. Storm Reid is awesome as Debra. Anna Popplewell is fantastic as Kate. Bonnie Aarons is outstanding as The Demon Nun. It's frustrating that after her terrifying debut in the brilliant The Conjuring 2(2016), Aarons' perfect portrayal as the titular character, should have been given better films in her solo franchise. Katelyn Rose Downey is good as Sophie. The supporting cast is impressive. The Nun II is worth a watch for fans of The Conjuring franchise. However, if you're used to horror movies, go for it with extremely low expectations.",2023-09-12
"Okay, I rarely give low scores because I want to enjoy movies but I found it hard to like this, definitely parts I liked but as a movie no,The story is about a girls boarding school in Paris, some creepy things happen and it begins to escalate, meanwhile at a nunnery we meet our 2 main Nuns, sister Irene and Debra. They go across the country to find out about why members of the church are being killed while suspecting a demon.What I did like first. About 1hr in a solid 25 minutes are really good, the nuns get to Paris and go through events while back at the school things start spiralling out of control, the acting is quite good and I liked seeing Anna Poppelwell and the last time I saw her was Narnia, she was very good, the acting all round was good, the end was kind of cool, and the reveal is nice too.I didn't like the use of CGI it completely takes you out of it, the first hour is build up, nothing else, anything ""scary"" is just a jumpscare and at this point I'm immune they suck, the opening one was good and the pages were cool, other than that boring. It just felt like they wanted to do SO much yet the movie felt dragged to bits. I think WB need to just give James Wan a massive cheque and let him do the rest, they taint the ""universe"" it's building with such bland and generic movies, not good, 5.5/10.",2023-09-13
"This Movie begins with Jacques, he arrived too late at the church. Father Noiret is on fire, The Demon Nun killed him. Maurice is working early in the morning at the garden of the high school. The Demon Nun killed a child. Sister Irene her nose is bleeding, something is about to happen. Sister Irene gives Maurice tomato seeds as a gift. The Demon Nun grabs Sister Irene her troath. Sister Irene fell down, she is unconscious
Cedric attacks Madame Laurent, she died afterwards. Maurice tells Sister Irene that The Demon Nun is back. Maurice turned into a monster, he is possessed by The Demon Nun. Sister Debra knocked down Maurice. Maurice chokes Sister Irene. Maurice fell down, he was chasing Sophie. Sister Irene tries to stop Maurice. Maurice brought The Demon Nun back. The Demon Nun set Sister Irene on fire. Sister Irene defeated The Demon Nun. Maurice tells Sister Irene that she saved his life. An Okay Movie, this was just okay. Not as exciting as the first 'The Nun' Movie. Looking forward to the next Movie of The Conjuring Universe!",2023-10-31
"Overall I would say this was a significant improvement from the first film. Instead of following a cookie-cutter eye-rolling plot, this story was a lot more expansive and ambitious. There was some new imagery introduced that was not only frightening, but captured the essence of the demon Valak and the lore that goes along with the character. Farmiga seemed to forget how to act, overacting at times and then under acting at others. She seemed very stiff and not quite immersed in the script. The child actors outshone her with little effort. All that being said, I think the Nun II benefitted from a larger budget and a longer runtime. The film wasn't anything special by any means, but it's enjoyed it more than the first Nun and some of the other films in the Conjuring universe such as La Lorena and the third Conjuring.",2023-10-29
"The movie got off to a great start with the appearance of the demonic entity. The mystery presented in the movie was good and simple, but the director was very advanced from what he did in previous horror movies. He wanted us to participate in the mystery and to know what the evil entity wants.The story was different from the usual horror movies in that there was movement and movement of places, but it was not much, but it was a new idea, because we see many horror movies that take place in one place, where a house is inhabited by an evil spirit, so one or two people come and take it out.The last one: Here the movie took negative ratings because the movie was not scary enough, but this kind of became good, as it contains a little bit of jumpscaries and took some of the features of the Conjuring world, and also because the ending was very expected and very bad, and there was no creativity in the end, but it is a step to make other horror movies with better endings.Rating of the work: 7/10.",2023-09-16
"Five years on from her first outing, Taissa Farmiga dons her holy robes to return as the nun who is a dab hand at facing down satanic apparitions. It's France in the 1950s and a priest is seized in his own church and brutally killed. Not by a person though - and that's where ""Sister Irene"" comes in. Fairly quickly her investigations take her to a girl's school where a previous tragedy has left a room completely sealed off and that's where she senses the source of this evil may be lurking. Can she figure out who this demon is and thwart it's ambitions - ambitions that really centre on the absorption of her own, true, spirit? Well, what do you think? We have a bit of eye candy from Jonas Bloquet's handyman ""Maurice"" but that's countered by far too many children - so often the death knell in horror films with their screeching, squealing and toxic effect on the jeopardy of any story - if only they would actually just do as they were told! To be fair, though, they are not the only thing that drags this down. It's all so very verbal, procedural and predictable. Even the visual effects are a direct descendent of the first film with a denouement that cannot be a shock to anyone. I know it's hard to reinvent the wheel in this genre, but films like this really offer very little by way of creative innovation, acting/writing skills or even providing the merest hint of scariness. Adequate for Halloween television, but no more I'd say.",2023-10-22
"More or less exactly what I expected from sequel to The Nun, directed by Michael Chavez. The Nun II, in many ways, parallels The Conjuring 3, Chavez's previous addition to the Conjuring Universe. The scares are decent and sometimes effective but overall rather tame, there are strong imageries, and the subpar and mediocre first half is elevated by the latter half. But that second half, while being watchable and mildly enjoyable in both films, neither of them really reach the level of actually being good or great.I got a few things out of the first one when I saw it five years ago. It was not really scary, the characters were weak, but the visuals were somewhat great. The sequel improves in some aspects, and takes a step back in others. Overall, I think this film stands above the first one, but not by far. The first movie was a full-blown gothic horror movie, and had an excellent atmosphere and production design. That gothic identity is mostly gone or altered here, and I'll say it is a step down regarding those parts. However there still are a lot of good cinematography in the film, with a standout being a shot of sister Irene and Debora catching a taxi in the crowded french street. It was so good that it feels like it belongs in a different movie.The characters are still underdeveloped, and this time it really pains me because in the end, as I finished a journey with these characters I felt a little spark of emotion in my heart. Something resembling care, satisfaction, fondness, whatever. I think I grew to like the characters as I spent two hours with them and almost got to actually caring deeply about them, but I still wish they got more characterizations. Like I said, the film is mildly enjoyable but the storyline and the characters could have been so much stronger.The relationship between Sister Irene and Morris is one of the more interesting ideas in the film, and I wish they explored that storyline a lot more, adding on what was left from the first one. But in the actual film they are mostly separated, and when they eventually reunite, the film has neared its final act and Morris's possession has taken over him, so there isn't time for that. What I liked tho, is sister Irene's secret that is revealed in the end & her connection to the film's main mythos.Michael Chavez isn't totally incompetent with constructing scares and building tension, but compared to other better examples from contemporary horror films, his direction falls flat. Many times the scares are too predictable, or the tension loosens too soon. Speaking of scares, some of the film's strongest scares being spoiled in the trailers definitely didn't help with my experience with the movie. I get that you gotta include some scares to make a good trailer and make people want to see the film, but the fact is that it was detrimental for my viewing experience. And I'm sure I'm not alone in this.The review reads a little to negative, but I still sort of enjoyed it in the end, and I'm just trying to emphasize that it could have been something greater than this. It's really mixed, on the verge of positive rating and negative. Anyways in the end, this is another Okay entry to the Conjuring Universe. The film includes a post credit scene that teases the next direction/entry of the franchise, but unless James Wan or David F. Sandberg returns, I don't think I'll be actually excited for a Conjuring movie again.",2023-09-28
"Goat Demon stole the show..! ""Nun 2, "" like its predecessor, is a mish-mash of so many genres that it's hard to pin down how good or bad it is because it doesn't fully commit to any single aspect: be it horror, action-adventure, sword-and-sorcery, monster movie, detective thriller, or just plain flat-out serious drama. With that said, we have a burgeoning ambitious popcorn movie with not quite enough ""pop"" but quite a bit of potential. I suppose my genuine gripe is that ""Nun 2"" is ""right there"" or ""almost there"" in being an amazing movie. Instead, it is just very likeable, due mostly to terrific and sincere performances across the board. But, other than the set up and actual presentation of goat demon, there is not enough unique scares (in my humble opinion) to put ""Nun 2"" over the top into classic horror tier...or horror action adventure detective mystery tier...or...well, whatever the heck it is...Ultimately, there's plenty of heart and sincerity in ""Nun 2"" which create significant poignant dramatic moments for the two leads Farmiga and the dude who plays Maurice (too lazy to Google his name sorry). The final parting shot with Tessa Farmiga as the titular last nun standing is poetic and bittersweet. Here's hoping ""Nun 2"" does well enough to justify a third outing with more nuanced scares and better defined stakes. We know Valek is evil, but why? So Valek is the villain, but, again, aside from a sheer appetite for destruction, what motivates Valek's villainy? Heck, what even is ""Valek?"" In the movie, Valek is only explained as a preternatural elemental evil which takes the form of a beatific servant of God to taunt humanity. There should be more to it. Hopefully, maybe, ""Nun 3"" will go there...!",2023-09-19
"For someone reason every time I watch these movies I get bored the first nun I didn't sit through it very well I can't even remember what the story line was but there was a lot of hype about the Nun 2 so I figured maybe it would be better than the first one and I could get into it more but nothing has changed soooo slow to start up poor jump scares, I'm BORED non the less they need to put these movies to rest and don't make anymore should of kept the story of the nun only in the conjuring movie she was scary there we didn't need a break down of her character same with the 50 different Annabelle movies that aren't even good! Annoyed.",2023-10-06
"The movie is totally good. But, the ending is kinda weird, because Valak-the demon is being died too quickly. The ending scene is kinda confused.Besides, the casts are still excellent, the plot is fine, and those scenes in the movie are amazing but the color of movie is quite dark and it is hard to see the casts and the characters. Furthermore, the volume of the characters are too low to hear but the musics are too loud to hear.Conclusion, the movie is great, the casts are great, the plot is fine, but its ending too quick, and not only me but also the other audiences do not understand the ending.",2023-09-08
"When are we going to get a really scary Conjuring franchise movie? I am really longing for a movie that can actually scare me. I am not saying that I am not easily scared, I am just saying that the conjuring movies are way too predictable every time we get a scene. I want a really unpredictable movie where there is a scene of somebody talking or doing whatever and then suddenly they cut to a really scary face (the Nun in this case) and some incredibly uncomfortable sounds that make me want to look away! I want a movie that has double the amount of jumpscares instead of a too hard to follow plot. The acting is good but they make it too hard to care about the plot like the mcguffin thing with the eyes and all that didn't really fit into the movie for me, like what was the point? She was defeated right after so what gives?",2023-09-20
"Firstly ,I loved about this movie is no unnecessary nudity and romance.....all Conjuring movies are family friendly. The NUN 2 comes out with great visuals and better closeup face shots of the bonnie's(valak) and the sound effects was amazing.. before interval it felt like they are just stretching the movie story.but after interval it was amazing.but this is a decent horror movie not too good not bad as the end of the valak is just same as the first one ...and without too much effort they killed valak at last ...just by naming god, a powerful demon died..which felt like fast story telling......",2023-09-08

That one is in the part 2 of The Conjuring!Need the feel of scare and think it might happen with the Nun 2 with its predecessor. The first one was quite good, so did believe to see something of that in this one.No, Sister. You are all alone from here and out.

"A sequel to the 2018 hit of the same name, ""The Nun II"" continues the travail of a terrified nun in her quest to end the infernal reign of some demonic Mother Superior. Sister Irene is a young nun residing in a rural convent in post-war France. Moving on with her life after her horrifying experiences in her past fate becomes an impish puppet-player as it manipulates events that'll send her reeling and screaming into the abyss she narrowly escaped from. Shot in way too dark overtones the film is a missed opportunity of a poor script, clunky scares, a lava-like pace and pc insertion all barely saved by fine acting. Wide-eyed and fresh-faced Taissa Farmiga delivers in the lead role as her efforts are sunk in the quagmire of poor filmmaking. Tedious and even amusing the millions who made this and its predecessor hits bequeath you a possible part III. Enjoy.",2023-09-27
"I really enjoy the main actress in this film and have since seeing her in COVEN from AHS, but I'm not sure if I really liked this movie. It had moments that had me curiously intrigued but I wasn't sold on the plot. Comparably, the POPE'S EXORCIST had me completely enthused and I guess I felt that this film may also exhibit some curious revealings from a Catholic Church element. I understand this is meant to show some details toward the rest of the CONJURING franchise, and I am wondering how that will tie together - but I'm not convinced this was one I'll be watching again as a horror fan.

"I have not watched a Conjuring franchise movie in theaters before so I was really excited to watch this. Also, I was a big fan of the first movie, maybe one of the only fans of the first movie to be honest. To start, I don't think this one was as good as the first movie. With that being said though, I still really enjoyed this one. It was really everything I would've wanted in a sequel to the first one. A creepy atmosphere, good characters, and some scares. I will say, the plot was the star of this movie, not necessarily the scares. The plot definitely improved over the first Nun movie. Of all the movies in the franchise, though, this is one of the weaker ones in terms of just the overall scariness. The directing choice was a little concerning for me because I didn't find The Curse of La Llorona or Conjuring 3 to be good at all, but I think he did a much better job with this movie. So, overall, I am happy with this movie and I'm very excited to see what comes next in the franchise.",2023-09-08

Lets add more wind "".I didn't care about any character. We knew who the ""bad guy"" was all along. I watched it because I read it was better than the first one. Well, no.

"I was one of the few people who really enjoyed the Nun (2018) and it was great to see characters like Sister Irene and Frenchie back. This time around sister Irene gets sent to a boarding school in France to stop the demon from killing and gaining too much power.The movie starts off rather slow and builds up tension during its runtime. Throughout we get several scenes of visions from sister Irene and Frenchie in the boarding school experiencing the demon showing off his power. The third act is pretty action-packed and jumps from one suspenseful scene to the next.For me this was kind of a mixture between Annabelle 2 and The Nun. Overall I liked the movie and think that is is a decent entry in The Conjuring universe, but like I said I was a huge fan of The Nun (2018) and think that this second part did not have the same strengths. But still the movie had some genuinely unsettling and creepy moments like the first one. It's no masterpiece but it does a fine job scaring and entertaining the viewer. [6,7/10]",2023-10-15
"Totally Underrated, i would give a 7.5 imdb score
Visually incredible must watch on cinema screen.Acting of Taissa Farmiga incredible +1000% confidence gain
The end give me non stop goosebumps.The Nun, sister irene, visuals, the fight and action at the end is worth the watch
all in all a very new step in the conjuring universe new style succeeded very well.Not boring a minute, scary depends how your level is
mine is very high, to scare me is nearly impossible
I think it is a beautiful movie, more story, no stupid sensless jump scares
The jumpscares were very well dosed not too intensive or level causing ptst
Very well written, interesting story, i could say one of a kind movie since it is not a regular cheap horror
Story may have its weaknesses but it is so good no story even the best imdb movie has no weakness
Enjoy the movie in theather since the visuals are high profile incredible nun
Acting of Taissa Farmiga was incredible she got very professional came as amateur and got a pro
The development to watch was incredible. Somehow people give 5.9 which is good for horro genre
But this movie is more than a 5.9 horro genre rating compared to other movies it is a 7m5 in my eyes
Since 7 is a must watch score and this movie is a must watch. Dont wait for the tv or stream release,
You will loose a lot quality visualt no tv can deliver still no nolan movie but worth for a cinema visit to watch in a big acreen

"I personally didn't like the first movie and was furious thinking why the second part is coming.The movie was a decent continuation of the first part and was also little bit better than the first part. The story starts slow, get's dragged and then it picks up in the climax. The screenplay was uneven, the direction was average and the performances were also okay. The runtime was too long, they could have easily cut half an hour. The pacing was also slow for first hour of the movie.Overall, you can give this movie a try as it is a decent horror entertainer but I don't think a sequel was needed for this one.",2023-10-05
"Somewhere on the internet someone claimed that the Conjuring universe has become something of a Marvel/Avengers of the horror world and it's hard to disagree with that statement with its dwindling returns also similar to the phase of the Marvel world right now where once bright beacons of the genre have petered out to generic and forgettable offerings that have little of the goodness that once flowed through their cinematic veins.Starting out in great fashion with James Wan's original Conjuring in 2013 and remaining steady with its sequel in 2016, there are now a total of 9 feature films in the extended Conjuring cinematic space with a further two already announced, meaning that a dilution of quality has been an ongoing problem for the name brand that once more here ventures back into the space of the worlds most nefarious nun with Michael Chaves direct sequel to 2018's The Nun.Thankfully a slight step-up from the terribleness that was Corin Hardy's original solo nun outing, The Nun 2 is saved only by a few neat sequences and a fairly entertaining schlock-filled finale that gives Black Philip a chance to shine as Chaves and his leading lady Taissa Farmiga struggling to actually make The Nun 2 a scary offering that far too often delves purely into the jump scare world of horror film-making that forgoes any real sense of purpose, any real logical plot movements or characters we care about as it goes for the lowest hanging fruit it can pick in giving audiences a scare-inducing ride.Bonnie Aarons the ""demon nun"" still remains a scary creation in her own right and the films 1950's European set locales certainly feel the part of a horror film but Chaves is unable to conjure up anything much of note here as Farmiga's Irene joins Storm Reid's pointless to the stories fellow nun Debra as the two are tasked by the church to track down the person/entity responsible for a string of gruesome murders across the region that suggests a far more interesting story than the one we actually get that just so happens to include Anna Popplewell's (grown up from Narnia) Kate, Katelyn Rose Downey as her daughter Sophie and Jonas Bloquet's returning Maurice, joining the gang on a predictable and stale set-up that could've been a whole lot more memorable handled correctly.Much like Marvel films there is now a ""Conjuring"" formula these core and off-shoot films stick to very closely, working with directors for hire to deliver run of the mill offerings that are low-budget and easy to make a quick buck from but if the brand name continues to follow this route they will quickly run out of fans willing to pay hard earned money to witness proceedings they have already seen and seen delivered in a more memorable fashion, suggesting James Wan's creation needs to either stop before it reaches the point of no return or do something unexpected to enliven the property once more.Final Say -A predictable and barely passable new addition to the Conjuring world that can only lay claim to being slightly more enjoyable than its dire original offering, The Nun 2 is another uninspired entry into the franchise that suggests the tank is well and truly empty when it comes to effectiveness and creative spark.2 tomato plants out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",2023-09-14
"Just watched it and I am very very impressed!!! I am a huge fan of the conjuring series but I must say the first Nun was fine, nothing less and nothing more...but the second one blew me away! Perfect mix of horror,storytelling,comedy & visual effects! Storytelling was perfect! Not to slow, not to fast. A very nice surprise for me as a visual effects artist were the shots and effects! Also worth mentioning are the actors! They were on point and had nice chemistry! Highly recommend to watch the movie in the cinema especially considering the sound effects! Overall 10/10.Oh I even got scared a few times, which rarely happens in modern horror movies to be honest!",2023-09-20
"At first when I watched the non-one I was a kid and I pretty much enjoyed it a lot and since that day I was waiting for the second part of the movie, and after that, I enjoyed every single storyline like the conjuring and the Annabelle and I enjoyed every single moment of it I know I wish the non-2was so good. That I want to watch again and I suggest for everyone to watch to an imax it's more interesting and the storyline for the nun 2 it was a very like it doesn't make sense, and it was like a perfect storyline from the start to the end, the scary s scene and the jump scare was on point. Thank you.",2023-09-07
"As a Conjuring franchise fan and a huge fan of The Nun, I can honestly say that I really enjoyed The Nun 2.We get to find out what happened to Sister Irene and Maurice after the first Nun movie. No spoilers at this point, but the scary scenes were REALLY terrifying. Valak seems a lot more angry and visceral. I am happy to report that there's more of a story in this one, and REAL characters this time. In the first Nun movie, Sister Irene is talking to people that we discover are not really there...that does NOT happen this time. All of the characters are real in this one.MILD SPOILERS:
Sister Irene has to solve a mystery, with a search for a holy relic that includes a scene that reminded me of the map room scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Sister Irene and Valak both want the power of a holy relic, which also reminded me of Raiders of the Lost Ark and reminded me of the search for the Holy Grail in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.Maurice develops new relationships and there is a satisfying ending (no spoilers).A cool connection is made between Sister Irene and Lorraine Warren.Overall I give it a 9/10. There were fewer scenes with Sister Irene and Maurice together, which makes me like the first Nun movie a bit better.But I liked The Nun 2 better than The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It and Annabelle Comes Home.",2023-09-08
Wonder why many are saying this second part is better than the first ? The first part is far much better with a better classic ending.The reapperance of Valak after being perished in the first part was not properly explained and the reason as to why the poor priest had been targeted in the beginning was vague as well. There are many characters involved in this second part making it look like a mess and the appearance of the evil goat was just ridiculous. The connection between the goat and the main evil character was uncertain and the reason they were going after for the eyes of St Lucy is something non logical and seems like an after thought.,2023-09-24
"It's 1956 France and the Nun is back. Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga) has been living in a quiet convent when the Vatican calls on her. She is reluctant to do it again but her new friend Sister Debra (Storm Reid) is eager to join. They are headed to a school where Maurice (Jonas Bloquet) is the new handyman. He likes young teacher Kate (Anna Popplewell) and the bullied student Sophie.This is better, but it's still problematic. Honestly, I don't remember the first movie. This needs a Previously On segment. It takes over an hour for Irene to get to the school. I do like Sophie and the mean girls. It's a pretty standard scenario. The donkey window is interesting. Here's my pitch. Maurice is the one who calls Irene. He notices the same things happening again. I would also hold back the reveal. This is a slight improvement, but it's still not scary enough.",2023-10-05
"The Nun 2 makes the bold creative choice to be even dumber than the first and the longer run time also hinders it but overall it's still a fun horror movie that finishes what The Nun started, completing the transition into blockbuster territory and seriously benefitting from a nastier Nun that takes way less prisoners than usual.Taissa Farmiga returns to a role that offers her almost the exact same as last time but thanks to a deeper exploration into her past still gives her something fresh to play with. Storm Reid gets way more than expected which is great and confirms when it comes to looking scared or sad she is one of the best in the business.Michael Chaves is becoming the go to filmmaker for this franchise so they're getting more formulaic but his direction continues to improve. The saturation here is generally a lot nicer and the scale never exceeds its budget. The scares still try to be inventive and benefit from an added nastiness here but the constant sound of bones crunching is getting so stale.",2023-09-08
"If you liked The Nun you will like this. This film has no sarcasm, stupidity, or fake jump scares. Totally serious evil horror, which was what I was hoping for. The acting was great, the atmosphere and story was good, and it was very creepy (with one really good scare). The pacing was great for a two hour film. Compared to The Conjuring, which I give a 10 star rating, this film is an 8 star rating.I believe this is the best horror film of 2023 thus far. Evil Dead was just old ideas rehashed with a lesser cast. The Demeter had some of the worse CGI effects I've seenin recent times. Insidious 3 was slow and lack scares. The Popes Exorcist could have been great but it was cliche and predictable. The Exorcist IV has yet to come out so this is the best horror film so far.",2023-09-10
"I have been watching the Conjuring Universe for nearly a decade now. I am so pleased with the setting varieties, audience curiosity, soundtrack, and amount of jump scares. The Nun 2 did a great job of camera work, suspense building, and acting. I saw the The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It when it came out in theaters. It was a long wait time for this next one, and well worth it! For your future reference, keep in mind that the sounds may be quite loud if you watch it in theaters, at least that was the experience at the one I was at. Don't watch trailers if you want the most authentic and eager experience with this one!",2023-09-13
"Finally this afternoon I got to see this follow-up to the 2018 first original one which made a lasting impact on me.Reading about it I got slightly intimidated by it and, which can be helpful with a horror movie, slightly scared and nervous in going to see it. As a fan of reli-horror this was totally up my alley.But boy, was I disappointed and turned down by this 1.Such clichés ( dark rooms and corners, only thing missing was thunder and lightning) very few jump-scares and WHERE was Valak?? I was so looking forward to Bonnie reprising her role but she barely came into view until the last 5 minutes. All everybody in this film was worried about was Sophie and those other stupid little girls plus a few annoying teenagers. Pity they did not get slaughtered. The goat was barely visible too ( completely underlit) and thanks to Google Images I know what he looked like. Even the music was a total disappointment. In the 2018 Nun the arrival of Valak was announced by a crucifix turning upside down and the swelling voices of a men's choir. Spooky and ominous. Where are they here? Totally missed opportunity. Cinematography was ok.",2023-10-15
"I was excited when I saw that The Nun II was going to come out. I like to go to the cinema often and I like to head to the ""coming soon"" section. There I saw that The Nun II was going to be released on the 8th of September.I feel this movie is getting a lot of attention. If I hadn't seen that it would be released in my local cinema, than I'm sure one of the many buses driving around town would have shown me.I watched this movie without having any idea of what exactly happened in the first Nun. Luckily because of a flashback it wasn't necessary that I still needed to recall the first Nun.Unfortunately my experience of this movie was a bit less at times due to a few seats way from us, 2 girls who were barely the legal age to watch this movie thought it was necessary to laugh and giggle throughout the entire movie. Whenever I used to watch horror movies growing up even though I was still too young, I would do the same, and I would blame fear for that. In certain movies like the Barbie one I saw a couple of weeks ago, I would not have cared as much but for a horror movie it took a bit of the experience away.Besides the settings of the abandoned church in France where part of this movie was shot, it were the special effects that truly made a huge impact on this movie. The newspaper stand for example? Maybe a bit predictable but breathtaking with how they filmed it. Same with the stain on the wall near the stairwell when the girls were on their way to class, truly mesmerising.Great movie I would say once again but I do not remember a lot from the first movie).",2023-09-11
"I loved the Nun and love the Nun II! It is very difficult to make a series where the second is as good as the first. This was!A great continuation of the story line, even if you hadn't seen the first movie you would know where you are with this one. A great continuation and stand alone.The story, the writing, the casting CHECK CHECK CHECK. Although the Nun's new assistant was a loose string. Who is she? Why is she of importance? I feel like a lot of that is probably on the cutting room floor. So that was disappointing. I kept waiting for something.Other than not understanding the Assistants role this movie was everything I hoped for and expected. Thank you thank you thank you for not disappointing me!",2023-10-13
"I went to the cinema to see this as I'm a huge fan of horror films in-particularly the conjuring franchise as it's so well put together.In regards to this sequel, I have to say it's an improvement from its predecessor. A lot more horror, the story is more thrilling & horror based than the its first film. I enjoyed the scares & the discoveries, & the realisation of the film series being tied in with the conjuring films. Very cleverly executed. Bravo!I would like to praise Bonnie Aarons for her superb performance as 'The Nun' - her acting makes it somewhat believable. Such a skilled actress.",2023-09-15
"I loved this one! It's a truly VAST improvement from the horrifying (and not in a good way) mess that was the first film. The characters, storylines, lighting and cinematography..etc are all absolutely phenomenal and creative which showcases Chavez's blunt spirit to create something new and unique. Both Storm Reid and Anna Popplewell have been such fine additions to the Conjuring Universe and that's of course due to their absolutely stellar performances. All in all, the movie contains many twists and turns that I know some will absolutely enjoy while others may not, it's an amazing film nonetheless.",2023-09-06
"Attrocious, they had a real, real opportunity to make a quality film, the nun 1 was well executed, plenty of jump scares and slid right in to the magic that is the conjuring/insidious universe! I had high hopes for the this film and was brutally disappointed, in the 1 hour and 45 minutes run time Valek (the nun) appears for all of 3 minutes as the shocking and frankly un-connected storyline thankfully comes to an end, the ONLY redeeming feature is the quality of the acting, the actors all play there role (however poorly directed) with perfection, but for me it is by far the weakest and most boring of all the films in the conjuring/insidious universe, not a patch what so ever on the first, honestly wouldn't waste time or money seeing it, it is in no way a follow on from the first or a lead up to anything... very very very disappointed as a huge James Wan fan. Nearly fell asleep half way through, doesn't even have any suspense scares, the 3 attempted scares are so predictable and obvious that it's almost cringey. 1/10.",2023-10-20
At first the slight 20 min of the movie was just the nuns slight same.The next 40-50 mins were slightly intersting cuz the nun returns.the character built-up of mouries could be better. Because he has the main guy instead of hime the focous was on slight the kids n their pranks.The plot could have been more better it all lied of believe. If you believe it happens. That was the part I felt that's it the movie is done. The nun was just horrific. They worked hard on edits which I loved ovarall I could say it's *good* not a word more than if decent movie to watch. At the end loot of JUMPSCARES which irritates a bit but could be less.,2023-09-24
"Good grief what a boring movie. It should not be listed as a horror movie. This movie is more for teens In my honest opinion. I'm certainly not a writer but I swear I could've written a much better story than this!!...not kidding. Not even one single jump scare, nothing scary at all or even interesting about this one. What a disappointment. Such a shame. I don't know why I even gave 3 stars. I guess I felt bad for the producers who spent whatever amount they did on this movie. The first movie was better than this and that's saying a lot.I'm glad I didn't pay to watch this at the theater.....",2023-10-28
"The issues I had with The Nun II (pacing, visual murkiness, overly busy plot) are the same as those that afflicted director Michael Chaves' previous outing, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It. Instead of building on the operatic style of The Nun, Chavez instead delivered a movie that looks and feels exactly like his last one. For most of its run time, The Nun II is a little more than a haunted house movie with creaky floors, creaky doors and things lurking in the shadows. The Nun succeeded because it was distinct from its sibling franchises (The Conjuring and Annabelle). Now that this franchise is stylistically the same as the others, its reasons for existing are almost nil. Farmiga and Bloquet are solid, but the movie that surrounds them is a tired slog. I'm guessing (hoping?) that Valak will finally meet the Warrens in The Nun III and bring this element of the Conjuring lore to a close. With that in mind, there is no compelling reason to see this movie. Not Recommended.Detroitcineaste dot net.",2023-09-26
"My biggest issue with both episodes of The Nun was the origin and cause of the story. The Conjuring was good because everything that happened in the main story made sense. However, in this episode, a continuation of the first, the inadequacy of the reasons behind the events of the story bothered the audience. If there was a reason, it was either very superficial or unacceptable.As we've seen in movies of this genre in the past, because few people were aware of the evil events, a double attraction was formed, but in The NUN, the whole churches of Europe knew about these events and it was as if it was a normal thing at that time.Compared to the first part, there was a good improvement in the scary and terrifying scenes of the story, but not enough to call it a masterpiece or the best horror movie of the year.",2023-10-03
"I gave this an 8/10 for the sole purpose I love Farmiga and Bloquet's acting, and EVERY scene they're in together, be it flashbacks or otherwise, is amazing. I won't spoil the ending, but you can tell they care deeply for one another, as Frenchie teases they're bounded for eternity together. Would love to see more of them in the next movie!!Now onto the new characters - I feel like Debra, in a sense, took place of the priest from the first Nun so she was alright, but Kate's character was a bit of a bore. Kate's kid, though, was a great addition to the plot.As far as the overall story, it was okay. A few too many jump scares, but I did appreciate the scene in the alleyway with the magazines (already spoiled from the trailer). I feel like there was also several storylines that should have intersected earlier in the movie. I know some give the first movie a hard time, but I actually enjoyed that one a bit more? Either way, I definitely think this is a rewatchable movie!",2023-09-10
"While attempting to incorporate every conceivable cliche (such as bullies in school and a girl being sent to become a nun in a Middle Ages-like style because, you know, the father decided it shall be that way), the writers seemed to have forgotten that they were supposed to create a horror story. The Nun 2 is not a complete failure, but rather your pretty tame and rather lame standard horror movie that follows the familiar scenario of ""Holy Church against evil demon."" On the positive side, the film got well-executed cinematography, solid production values, and solid acting. It's possible that a mainstream audience might enjoy this film more, but for true connoisseurs of the horror genre, The Nun 2 is too mild, relying mostly and heavily on worn-out horror cliches. Last words: I had the sense that the first movie was better, although like another reviewer mentioned, I don't remember anything about it, or at least not much, and I'm pretty sure that in a few months, maybe even weeks, I won't recall the story of this one either. The first one got 5 out of 10, this one gets a rate of 3.5.",2023-10-07
"My wife and I watched the Nun II (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline revolves around a series of mysterious murders occurring in churches across Europe, prompting the Vatican to send its most experienced exorcist nun to track down the culprit and put an end to the horrors. During her investigation, she uncovers an ancient legend and traces it back to a boarding school...Directed by Michael Chaves (The Curse of the La Llorona) and featuring a cast that includes Cardellini (Scooby-Doo), Raymond Cruz (Training Day), Patricia Velasquez (The Mummy Returns), and Ricardo Mamood (The Curse of the La Llorona).Overall, The Nun II feels like a typical Hollywood horror production. The storyline and backstory show promise, and there are some intriguing subplots woven throughout. The kill scenes are intense, and there's a fair share of jump scares to keep you on edge. Certain horror elements worked well for me, while others fell short. Notably, I enjoyed the depiction of possessions and demons, which were executed perfectly. However, it relies a bit too much on CGI, and there's a scene with a librarian that was annoying and cliche.In the end, The Nun II has more misses than hits. I would score this a 4/10, but I'd still recommend watching it once.",2023-09-16
"Definitely better than the first, more story and character build. I would definitely put this up with the first conjuring and the first two Annabelle movies. Obviously they are better but I would say this is the 4th best film in the universe. Not too many jump scares which for me is a plus since I find too much jump scares unnecessary and ridiculous.The only issue I had with the film is that it did not really connect to any other film in this universe especially considering this was set only a few years before the first conjuring movie. Don't get me there were a few scenes that did connect with the conjuring films but only glimpses, not story wise.Overall a good movie but not the greatest out there!",2023-09-12
"It's the same as the first part, even worse. Unoriginal story plot cheap jump scares and bad special effects- the story lost me after 30 minutes- i couldn't care less about everything. The nun was scary as hell in the conjuring2 - but here she's just annoying, so they came up with the goatman (who came down from the stainglasswindow- lol) utter nunsense!

"So here we are with yet another blasé attempt at a film from the overall blasé ""universe"" that is the Conjuring. Barring the first two Conjurings, and maybe the second Annabelle, this has been such a frustrating experience watching such a mediocre franchise that started with such promise. I feel like Wan is the only one who understands this world he created. I'm saying all this because I'm tired of complaining about the same things over and over again when it comes to this baseless nonsense. Boring storyline, uninteresting characters, ineffective scares, lazy direction, and many others make me wish they should've left the original Conjuring alone. The Nun II is the same things I just complained about. The only thing that saves this from being amongst the bottom, is the acting. Taissa Farmiga, Anna Popplewell (who was awesome to see in this, I haven't seen her since Narnia, so it was a nice thing to see), and Bonnie Aarons who kills it as the Nun as always. I do acknowledge the mythological aspects of the narrative, I just wish I cared more. When you deliver too much mediocrity, or just pure negative experiences it's hard to get invested in a film I can tell is really trying, even though it's still bombarded with the same old issues that plague this franchise. I'm not sure how much more I can take before I check out, my only hope is that this film is a trend in the right direction.",2023-10-21
"I'm a die-hard fan of supernatural horror... So with that in mind:The Nun (original) is the only movie that literally gives me chills, I mean every second of it. Maybe it's the low-pitched chorus or the music or maybe the dread in the eerie silence and the shadows.This one was not really scary. The story was just ok and it fell into place for me the second time I watched it. However the story was not very strong or symbolic of the devil, whereas in the original Nun evil symbolized war.I really didn't like the CGI nun face with sharp bloody teeth coming out of the wall. I thought it was silly. Just showing the nun staring scares the wits out of many. We didn't see as many creepy scenes in this one.It was an okay watch for us, but not nearly as scary as the nun.",2023-10-09
"I recently had the unfortunate experience of watching ""The Nun 2,"" and I can't express how utterly disappointed I am with this film. As a horror movie enthusiast, I had high hopes for this sequel, but it turned out to be a colossal letdown in every conceivable way.First and foremost, the plot of ""The Nun 2"" is an absolute mess. It attempts to continue the story from the first film but ends up convoluted and confusing. The narrative lacks coherence, and the filmmakers seem to rely on cheap jump scares and gore to compensate for the lack of a compelling story. It's as if they decided to throw everything at the wall and hope something sticks, but it all just falls flat.The characters in this film are one-dimensional and lack any depth or development. Sister Irene, who was somewhat interesting in the first movie, is reduced to a bland and forgettable character with no growth. The other characters are equally forgettable, and you never really care about their fates. Valak, the demon nun, also loses her terrifying presence from the previous film, and her appearances are reduced to predictable and formulaic jump scares.The pacing of ""The Nun 2"" is a complete disaster. It meanders aimlessly for the majority of its runtime, with pointless scenes and subplots that go nowhere. When the movie finally does attempt to build tension, it does so with cheap, loud noises and predictable scare tactics that feel more like a desperate attempt to jolt the audience than genuine horror.The cinematography and visual effects are uninspired, failing to capture the gothic atmosphere that made the first film somewhat intriguing. The film's darkness becomes a hindrance, as it's often impossible to see what's happening on screen, further adding to the frustration of the viewing experience.Perhaps one of the most glaring issues with ""The Nun 2"" is its lack of originality. It relies heavily on tired horror clichés and tropes, offering nothing new or innovative to the genre. It feels like a cash-grab attempt to milk the success of the first film without putting in the effort to create something genuinely terrifying or engaging.In conclusion, ""The Nun 2"" is a prime example of a lazy and uninspired sequel. It fails to capture the essence of what made the first film intriguing and instead delivers a disjointed mess of a story, forgettable characters, and cheap scares. If you're a fan of the horror genre, I strongly recommend giving this one a pass and revisiting the original ""The Nun"" or exploring other, more worthwhile horror films.",2023-10-03
"It's like a bad super hero movie but with jump scares. Jump scares we're super obvious that were incoming.Had big expectations on this movie and the movie was lame. The couple sitting next to us stood up and left in the middle of the movie.**spoiler** the jump scare of the bird made this one guy at the cinema scream and it was super funny.I feel technology is so advanced to make this bad effects. Trailer revealed a lot of jump scares, so you could see when they were coming and what to expect after watching the trailer.In my honest opinion, just skip this movie, not worth your time or money.",2023-09-09
"The Nun II is a sequel to the 2018 horror film The Nun, which was a spin-off of The Conjuring 2. The film follows Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga), who returns to France to investigate a series of mysterious deaths linked to the demonic nun Valak (Bonnie Aarons). Along the way, she reunites with Maurice (Jonas Bloquet), who was possessed by Valak in the first movie, and meets new allies and enemies.The film is directed by Michael Chaves, who also helmed The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It. And perhaps that's why Chaves manages to create an atmosphere more in line with what he had done in the Conjuring series, thus promoting continuity not only in terms of history but also in terms of cinematography. He proves that he knows how to create atmospheric and suspenseful horror scenes, especially in the dark and eerie church where most of the action takes place. He also makes good use of the gothic and religious imagery, such as the paintings of saints, the crucifixes, and the stained-glass windows.The cast does a decent job of portraying their characters, with Farmiga being the standout. Oddly I didn't know that she was Vera Farmiga's youger sibling, which I found interesting since Vera is the main protagonist in the movie where this spin-off was made. Well, but Taissa does a good job of bringing emotion and conviction to her role as Irene, who struggles with her faith and her destiny. Aarons is also fantastic as Valak, who is more menacing than in the first movie.However, the Nun II has some flaws, as expected. This sequel, well, a bit like the first one, relies too much on jump scares and loud noises that get repetitive and predictable after a while and also does not explore much of the mythology or history of Valak, which could have added more depth.Overall, The Nun II is in my opinion, an overall better film than its predecessor specially in terms of photography and cinematography.It is not a masterpiece of modern horror, but it is a decent and entertaining entry in The Conjuring franchise.6/10.",2023-10-11
"Jesus this film is boring, I fell asleep and just found it confusing and dull, the weird relationship with Maurice and the school girl was borderline pedophilia, the snobby girls were just taken out of mean girls.Super confused as I thought they're in France but English teachers, some have accents and the girls have different accents.May have zoned out to explain.The jumpscares were good but predictable. Problem with the nun movies, you just see her, then they cut away from the kill.Paranormal movies are about the unseen yet this is a slasher, monster and paranormal movie, it can't figure out what it is.The nun was dull the only decent thing was the post credit with him being exorcised, this I didn't even get to the credits as it's a slow slow burner.",2023-10-07
One time watch movie with good graphics...main nun role to shot actually.... but yes good direction with whole team work.. cinematography is really nice... good background score included with all scenes. Some creative scenes also in this with very nice unbeatable editing source. Actors doing really awesome team work with brilliant acting skills.some shots movements need to improve specially in middle and closeup shots . Wide angle shots are really nice... overall movie is really awesome watchable with family and friends.. Movie in good quality sounds with great clear screen pictures . I really love the movie 🎥 The Nun 2 🙏🏻awesome 😎,2023-09-24
"I've enjoyed all the Conjuring films, admittedly some are better than others but I always have a good time watching them. The Nun 2 is no different. As far as sequels go it does its job brilliantly in expanding on what we already know and taking things further. Some people won't like the slower pace but I appreciate a director who isnt scared to take their time. The pay off here being more rounded and developed characters and a bigger picture of why things are happening rather than what is happening.If you're a fan of the genre or the series its well worth a watch.Also hang around during the end credits, there's a little cut scene that sets up the next (and final) Conjuring movie!",2023-09-11

"I'd like to give this movie a Thumbs up 👍👍. I didn't expect much from the movie, but I enjoyed it a bit. The story was Okay, but the music and also the scary moments were awesome. The runtime of the movie was absolutely good, I mean the movie ended well within the runtime. There are a few scenes in the movie that you might feel a little boring, but I promise that you will like the ending of the movie. There's also mid credits, so don't miss that. I'd like to see The Nun 3, if it ever comes out. So out of 5 stars, I would give the movie 3.5 stars...and on a scale of 1 to 10, I'll give 7 out of 10.",2023-09-12

"10/10. This film is GOATED i.e. It literally has a goat-man in it (not kidding). Thanks hollywood for this much needed sequel. (Didn't see the first one!)
Would recommend watching with family or friends and heck even FORCE your Coworkers to come and EnJOy this as it's a MUST WATCH, once in a lifetime experience!For a horror film, The Nun 2 meets all my/the requirements. It really has it all; despite it's silly storyline and somewhat sloppy build-up, it's action-packed with sick jump scares occurring every 5-10 minutes or so, it's got amazing details, as well as some awesome CGI. I also think Bonnie Aarons plays Valak really well, I couldn't imagine any other actress playing a more terrifying version of her. Some great performances from Reid and Farmiga also sugarcoats the movie's silliness, at least in my opinion.",2023-09-21
"The Nun 2 (2023) :
Movie Review -The Nun 2 Review: Michael Chaves serves as a director for the sequel to The Nun (2018), The Nun 2 (2023), which is the 9th film in 'The Conjuring' franchise. The Nun was slammed by critics, but I don't know why; I enjoyed it a lot. For me, it was and is the only film in the Conjuring universe that goes to the roots of the demon and the weapon (blood) to kill it. The Nun 2 didn't come with a lot of expectations, so it's a decent watch for those who liked/enjoyed The Nun and a skippable flick for others. The Nun is actually one of the most impressive ideas I have come across in the horror genre because it shows the Nun as a demon, while our ancient notion of the Nun has always been contrary. This one reason is enough to look at The Nun franchise as a standout horror film, but I agree that it needs to work on the storytelling. The Nun 2 has typical jump scares that would have people talking about the scenes during the watch. I saw many girls saying, ""Oh F.."" ""What the hell,"" ""Ohh Shiiiit,"" and such words during those elevated horror scenes. I guess they were enough for them, but not for me as a critic. Despite that, I didn't leave the auditorium with a heavy ache, and that's enough to call it a safe film.The Nun 2 continues the story forward from The Nun events as we see some new brutal murders happening around. Set four years after the ending of the first film, this sequel follows Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga) as she is given the task of finding the devil and stopping it. She has to face the demonic force Valak, the Nun (Bonnie Aarons), at a boarding school in France, where she is looking for the eyes of Saint Lucy. The relic holds unbeatable powers for both Irene and Valak. Meanwhile, Frenchie (Jonas Bloquet) is possessed by the devil after he saved Irene in the first film. The devil is using him to find those ""Eyes"" in the boarding school, where Frenchie has befriended a little girl, Sophie (Katelyn Rose Downey), and his mother, Kate (Anna Popplewell). Sister Irene is joined by Sister Debra (Storm Reid) on the hunt for the nun. Will they be able to stop Valak again and send her back to hell?The Nun is a pacy film with a runtime of 110 minutes, therefore becoming an engaging ride. The first two acts are quite slow, though, while the third act works as a saving grace for the film. The usual jump scares haven't become old-fashioned yet. Yes, we don't get that groundbreaking experience like Nosferatu (1922), Dracula (1931), Frankenstein (1931), The Wolf Man (1941), The Night Of The Demon (1957), The Exorcist (1973), and The Evil Dead (1981) from modern films, but we have something else. Today's horror films are more about technical brilliance, sound design, screams, silence before the storm, and extra-loud human scares. The Nun follows all these traditional formulas to present a new story, which is hardly unique. I can't understand why some writers have to go so over the top with their writing that it all starts looking fake and artificial, especially with children. That little girl here actually climbed up with one hand into a gigantic collapsing tower. What the hell?From the first film, I always felt that Taissa Farmiga suited the role of the innocent nun. She has that innocence on her face, and that carries the entire character very nicely. Her sensitive skin turns reddish in those dangerous scenes, adding extra naturality. Bonnie Aarons's Nun is scary enough to shake you from your seats. Won't scare the sh.. outta you, but yeah, something along those lines. Frenchie's character is well used here, and Jonas Bloquet has played it well. Storm Reid lacks worthy scenes; Katelyn Rose Downey shines as a child artist; and Anna Popplewell is somewhat okay. This isn't an acting-driven film, so it's unfair to expect too much when they have done fairly well.The Nun 2 empowers itself with an effective use of technical skills. Marco Beltrami's music, background score, and sound design are more than fine, as they help elevate your viewing experience. The big screen is the right place to understand it because the small screen won't do it justice. The cinematography by Tristan Nyby is good but could have been better. Why are there no reversed or rotated frames here? One would expect them in a supernatural horror flick, and when the devil is strong. A missed opportunity, I would say. The visual effects are impressive even in 2D. Michael Chaves has already directed a couple of films in the Conjuring universe, and both have been watchable. Well, he just made it again. Sadly, he didn't climb up the ladder. The Nun has some repetitive action and typical horror elements, but the conclusion gives it that much-needed extra push. Overall, it's another Nun film made with only one ambition, which is to not have any ambitions and be honest with your fans. Find your seat in the dark cinema halls if that suits you.RATING - 5/10*",2023-09-06
"I enjoyed the first film,it had flaws when it came to development of the story and characters but still had amazing settings,impressive scenes about faith,unique atmosphere and solid performances.This one takes the same solid aspects,amplifies them and also has a stronger development of the story and characters,Valak is creepier,the other forms as well plus delivers some violent and gory moments incredibly intense for a Conjuring film.To be fair this is my favorite Conjuring spin-off,has an outstanding vibe and Valak is by far the most terrifying character of the franchise,plus Sister Irene is the best character from the heroes of spin-off movies.The only bad thing was the theatre experience,the theatre was full and even though it was R rated there were many young kids and teenagers without parents,some of them really noisy(especially the teens,there were 10 year old children who were quiet during the entire film),like for real,is that hard to be polite and don't use the theatre like it's your own bedroom,and it wasn't the first time,at Black Panther Wakanda Forever there were four men(like in their 30s) who kicked the seats and were noisy,it's really hard to be educated nowadays???",2023-09-11
"Only the main antagonist is a male. Else they removed all male presence from the film or reduced their screentime to a few seconds. Set in an all girls school, all the staff are women, the nuns, even the patron saint chosen is a female.Twice one of the nuns calls upon God than the usual Jesus to drive away the demon. The lead's friend has no significant role except simply 'being there' that if she were not written in, there would have been no major impact to the storytelling - a role even though could have gone to anyone, the least attractive actor was chosen for it among a sea for more appealing ones.The story itself lacks appeal compared to the first installment that was mediocre. Tessa is good in her role but the plot needed to be fleshed out more, building momentum lead to the climax. At certain points the starts to drag before suddenly picking off again. Overall, watchable if theres no other option.",2023-09-10
"I genuinely loved the first nun film it genuinely was creepy and she literally to look at scared the poop out of me.. it really looked like I was staring at at demonic presence right in front of my eyes for real and as a horror fan there's nothing better then being surprised at a great new horror. I really was excited to see that there was a nun 2 but this, it doesn't do the first one justice at all. With this film it was so slow on starting and only got dome decent action in the lady half hour but again not scary just the usual horror tactics .. I wanted to love it but this isn't even Saturday night streaming worthing in my opinion and will drop out of the cinema quickly. Save your money.",2023-09-12
"I'm a huge fan of horror movies and try to watch every one, but this one is the worst I've seen in many years.I gave this film a 3 out of 10 rating because I actually fell asleep while watching it. It was 90% dark with hardly anything visible, and it seems like they used darkness to try to mask how bad the movie is. This is quite absurd, and it's not scary at all. The few redeeming moments only appear towards the end of the movie. They borrowed elements from 'The Walking Dead' zombies and mixed them with a nun - it's baffling! It only manages to scare children between the ages of 10-13; it's more like a movie filled with young kids running around and screaming. The Movie Insulted me.",2023-10-23
"And in the latest episode of the gluttonous Conjuring Universe we've begged them to end, our beloved prankster nun returns to play another round of games with Sister Irene, Maurice (Frenchie), and a bunch of new goofballs we don't give a s### about. In all seriousness though, The Nun II is a trashy horror sequel not worth paying to see in the cinema, and essentially just giving the message to the filmmakers that we crave this load of junk. The film is actually receiving a surprising amount of positive reviews, and whilst it's improved on some of the first movie's flaws, it just adds a bunch of new ones. And now they're probably do a third instalment that improves on this movie's issues, but brings even more of them. This'll go on until the end of human existence.The Nun II is directed by the same man who brought us The Curse of La Llorona and The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, two crappy supernatural horror films with absolutely no purpose other than to take your money. So what could we have expected? In fact, those two films are probably better than this movie. The most that can be praised are some infrequent entertaining scenes, a few mildly frightening moments, and the story had a bit more effort put into it. That's pretty much it. It's a clichéd supernatural horror film filled with endless jump-scares, boring set pieces and a wasted cast who barely have anything to work with.If you think about it, it's not usually the performances in these kinds of movies that are problematic, it's simply the screenwriting and whoever's directing them. In terms of technical aspects, the cinematography and lighting could use a bit more creativity. Most scenes are very dark and the camera angles are old. The fact that one of the film's locations is a boarding school, where one young girl has a close bond with an adult gardener, and other girls bully her, is a story sub-theme we've seen way too many times. The movie is also a lot tamer than its predecessor, meaning there's no shock value or gore in the kills or so-called ""scary"" scene. And most importantly of all, half piecing from the fact that the film is completely unoriginal, it's boring. The runtime is way too long and used poorly, the story moves at a snail's pace, and the dialogue feels as if it were written by robots. Let's just hope we get nun more of this.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",2023-09-15
"I went to watch this movie today, alone and by myself. And though one would fear the aggrivated sense of horror resulting from the no-company, that was not the case as the the movie had no real horror to start with. As a sequel for which some argubally solid foundation has been laid in the first part, it should've come better then what it is on the whole, I guess. Few medicore jumpscares here and there, with few suspenseful moments scattered throughout are all what this movie is really about. The death scenes and bodily harm are weak and not exciting, and the locations and settings for the encounters lack obscurity and atmosphere and had a layer of darkness makeup added to overshadow those shortcomings and make said places feel scary. I'm not trying to be overly harsh or anything, it's just that I believe the presentation could've been scarier and more interesting. It's OK overall and not at all a bad experience.",2023-09-18
"Firstly, I want it for the record that I like The Conjuring Universe and am a great fan of horror games that are related to reality. When it comes to The Nun, there are a few issues. The Nun I was built up on a small or big lie. Carta Monastery's chief priest said that there is nothing related to that in the history of the church or its ruins.Secondly, I am for anything that gives more scenes to Sister Irene. She has potential and is probably the best character for a horror movie series. Why? Because she is both innocent and corrupted. She has knowledge of the darkest things but keeps looking to the light.However, the next thing I am gonna say is not her fault. I think a nun-made exorcism is not bad. It is unexpected, a rare sight, but extremely interesting and something that caught my eye. But, when you make two nuns do the eucharist, the holiest and most sacred part of the catholic church...this is crossing a border I think will make many people angry. This is an extreme action, something I disagree with, and the reason why this will not be 10 stars for now.The 9-star rating that I am giving is because I want to support future movies in this universe and give all of them a chance. The boss battle at the end was brilliant.Very well done overall!",2023-10-06
"This is a solid piece of work.By now you should be completely aware of these Conjuring/Annabelle/Nun movies. They are all competently made, well directed, rely on jump scares a little too much but are solid movies for those who like their films like they like their roller coaster rides......lots of thrills and spills, lots of ups and downs, they are predictable, they deliver and will always get you to the end safely.In this movie we have the same cast as last time with the addition of Storm Reid as sister whatever in a role that serves no purpose and doesn't really fit in with the time when the
Movie is set. Apart from that it was ok.",2023-10-06
"Pleasantly surprised in this one since the first one was so bad it's not even funny. The stakes were higher, I actually cared about the characters and their motivations and it was definitely scarier. The atmosphere was not as good as the first but it didn't distract from the movie. The acting was really good which can be expected from a big budget movie. There was actually a plot in this one which was followed through about as well as can be expected, though there are still some unclear spots here and there but not big enough to be too noticable. I like the callbacks to previous movies in The Conjuring universe, heck this movie should've been the third conjuring movie. I am glad the sequel improved on the first, which rarely happens nowadays. Nothing too original here but the scares are pretty good and they definitely didn't hold back on the brutality in this one. I still think they could've have done better for the nun who is such a creepy character but this is about as good as it gets right after the second conjuring movie. Overall, not a complete waste of your time and a lot of improvements from the first.",2023-10-28
"This film is no where near the mastery of a James Wan horror plot. Overall, this is a ridiculous attempt to continue a saga with a weak story layout. The main antagonist (i.e., Valak) is nothing more than an empty jump scare. You gain nothing about trials, tribulations, test of faith, etc. There is nothing scary in this film, nor is there any tension, or a sense of feeling of dread. You can't root for the protagonists since they don't know what they are doing anymore than the antagonist demon who likes to simply appear, growl, and throw people across rooms. Any close-up of Valak strongly resembles CGI and is not even remotely intimidating.Overall, this is a non believable fantasy quest for a holy relic that will defeat Valak. Screaming and weak jump scares that you can see a million miles away. The second act of the film is mostly ""Aaaahh! Eeeeeh! Grrrrr! Aaaaaah! Eeeeeeh!"" that gets tiring very quickly. When Valak burns in the end, just like how Valak disintegrated in the Nun (Part I), you just want to end it all and say good riddance!",2023-10-07
"Immediately immersed. Storylines in the horror genre can sometimes fall victim to predictability, yet this film cleverly sidesteps clichés, offering a fresh perspective that's both enthralling and refreshing.The scares are where this film truly shines. They are not your standard, hurriedly inserted jump scares that often plague the genre. No, these are meticulously crafted moments of terror, built upon a foundation of suspense and anticipation. It's the kind of horror that lingers, that leaves an imprint on your psyche long after the credits roll.Visually, the film is a treat. The cinematography captures the eerie atmosphere perfectly, with each frame seemingly hand-picked to amplify the sense of dread. The play of light and shadow, the unsettling angles, and the moody color palette all come together to create a visual masterpiece that complements the haunting storyline.A noteworthy mention must be made of the sound design. The eerie background scores, the unsettling silence broken only by whispered secrets or distant, unexplained noises, all play a crucial role in building the tense atmosphere. It's a symphony of horror, where every note is perfectly pitched to unsettle.The performances are another feather in the film's cap. The cast doesn't just act; they live their roles. Their fear becomes palpable, their emotions raw and real, making it nearly impossible for the viewer to remain detached. It's this commitment to authenticity that pushes this film from being 'just another horror movie' to a class apart.But what truly differentiates this film from its peers is its ability to balance raw horror with depth. It doesn't merely rely on surface-level scares. Instead, it delves deep into the psyche of its characters, unearthing their deepest fears and vulnerabilities. This psychological depth adds layers to the narrative, making it as much a journey into the human mind as it is a horror film.In the realm of criticisms, there are minimal. While the pacing might falter momentarily, it quickly regains its footing, ensuring that the narrative doesn't lose its grip on the viewer. And while some might argue for a clearer resolution, the ambiguous ending only adds to the film's allure, leaving room for interpretation and further discussions.In conclusion, while it's hard to pin down this film with a definitive rating, its merit is undeniable. It stands as a testament to the potential of horror cinema, of what can be achieved when a team is truly passionate and committed to their craft. Avoiding the pitfalls of cheap thrills and clichés, it offers a horror experience that's both authentic and profound. This film doesn't just scare; it resonates, reminding us of the depths and complexities of the human psyche. Without a doubt, it's a must-watch, deserving its place among the most memorable horror releases of the year.",2023-09-17
"This, movie is not boring at all, it was very entertaining and the jump scares some had me on my edge of my seat the whole time. I watched it yesterday with my sister, and we can't wait for the Nun 3 to come out! This has to be the best movie by far I've watched in 2023, sound of freedom , and avatar were good as-well but doesn't top it like this one did. I love scary movies, and this one was just added to my top of the lists, we are hoping when the nun 3 comes out it's just as scarier as this one was. We can't wait , the scenes and whole plot was just amazing and good. They really did they're big one with this!",2023-09-20
"Besides Annabelle, The Conjuring Universe has become most associated with the Nun, first seen in The Conjuring 2, she got her own spin-off prequel, and now comes its sequel, directed by Michael Chaves (The Curse of La Llorona, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It). Basically, set in 1956, in Tarascon, France, Father Noiret (Pascal Aubert) and young Jacques (Maxime Elias-Menet) perform their daily chores in their church. Noiret hears strange noises investigates the disturbance, he is suddenly raised into the air, bursts into flames and is burned alive, witnesses by a terrified Jacques. Since the events at Saint Cartha's monastery, Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga, Vera's sister) is working in a convent in Italy. Maurice (Jonas Bloquet), who is working at a boarding school in France, has befriended young Irish student Sophie (Katelyn Rose Downey) and her teacher and mother, Kate (The Chronicles of Narnia's Anna Popplewell). Irene has a vision of Maurice asking her to save him. Cardinal Conroy (David Horovitch) is aware of her previous encounter with the demon Valak (Bonnie Aarons) and dispatches her to investigate a series of deaths across Europe, attributed to the demon. She travels to Tarascon with young novice Sister Debra (Storm Reid) who does not believe in miracles and has difficulty believing the sacrament of Holy Communion. Meanwhile, a delivery girl witnesses a possessed Maurice talking to Valak before the demon kills her. Irene and Debra travel to Palais des Papes and meet with librarian Father Ridley (Peter Hudson). He explains that Valak was an angel rejected by God, and there is a connection to St. Lucy, who martyred by a pagan. Though she was set on fire, St. Lucy miraculously did not burn; her eyes were gouged out, but her family recovered them. The librarian suggests the demon is killing descendants of St. Lucy it wants a powerful relic, last known to be in a former monastery-turned-winery. The former winery is now the boarding school. At the school, Irene and Debra are confronted by a fully possessed Maurice. Sophie shows the women a mosaic of a goat in the stained-glass window of the chapel. Using a flashlight to make the eyes glow red, it acts as a laser, pointing to where the eyes of St. Lucy are buried. Irene finds the relic and the mosaic goat disappears, reappearing in real life as a demonic creature. While the students are attacked by the goat, Maurice attacks Irene, chases Sophie, and causes the bell tower to collapse. Debra admits to Irene that she now has faith. Irene uses the relic against Maurice, but he grabs it, causing Valak to appear. Just like Father Noiret, Valak lifts Irene into the air and sets her on fire. But she surprisingly does not burn and subsequently realises she is a descendant of St. Lucy, able to harness the same power associated with the relic. Irene and Debra speak the words of Jesus during the Last Supper and barrels of wine as the blood of Christ. They soak Valak with the wine/blood and the demon is damned back to Hell. The next morning, Irene meets with Maurice, who appears to be fine. But she is worried as he leaves with Sophie and Kate. In a post credits scene, the Warrens, Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga), receive a phone call about a haunting (relating to events of The Conjuring 2). Also starring Suzanne Bertish as Madame Laurent, Léontine d'Oncieu as Simone, Anouk Darwin Homewood as Celeste, Tamar Baruch as Sister Amara, Natalia Safran as Sister Chloe, Alexandra Gentil as Sister Astrid, Viviana Moin as Sister Maria, Renata Palminiello as Sister Pia, Lieve Carchon as Sister Concetta, Kate Colebrook as Irene's Mother / St. Lucy, Margot Bernazzi as Young Irene, and Andrew Morgado as the Demonic Voice. Farmiga is fine, Bloquet is alright, and the supporting performances of Popplewell and Reid and others are reasonable, there is only a little bit of a story to follow, there are some jump scares and over-the-top moments that did get me, the special effects are good, and the eerie atmosphere is sort of there, it feels pretty much the same standard as the predecessor, but it's not a terrible gothic supernatural horror. Worth watching!",2023-09-17
"Not the best Marvel character, in my opinion.The main actress ""Sister whatever"" should not be taking Arnold's and Stallone's job. It's not a good look for her character. Explosions, fire, action, spectacular deaths, everything you want in a Marvel movie.They even have post-credit scenes, as expected in a Marvel movie. What more can i say about this superhero movie?It's dissapointing. Why did the writers/director take the movie this direction? Are they pressured by the executives to make it more action? Because that will bring a broader audience and will make more money the first week. Summary: Not scary and too much action. Isn't horror movies supposed to be scary? Nobody can make scary movies anymore..",2023-10-09
"It's a great horror movie with tons of jump-scares. And that's it. Valak is a demon that didn't really hurt her prey. So far she only killed two people. I expected Valak to be more malicious and demonic but, she just wasn't. She didn't appeared that much. And now that she has Maurice as her vessel, she has been using him for most of the scene; like chase scene, which is not that exciting nor does it induce that eerie, spine-chilling vibe.Plus, I feel like the scenes on Maurice, Sophie and her mom is rather unnecessary too. It doesn't help to advance the plot. It only serve to shows the relationship between the 3 of them and that's it.But what makes this movie unsatisfactory is the fact that Valak is a little too easy to kill. She has finally obtain Saint Lucy eyes, she has become a demon who has gain enormous amount of power like the Angel that she was- but she is too weak even after that.She didn't burn down the whole school. Or summon an earthquake and thunderstorm. Or whatever that can make her seems powerful with that power in her hands.She just tries to burn Sister Irene. Which was what she successfully done to the priest in the beginning.And then she get killed. That's it. That's all the glory of the demonic Nun Valak we get to see.That was incredibly disappointing. I was expecting so much more after Valak obtain Saint Lucy eyes.It's a good thing that the muscular Devilish Goat is in the movie. At least the chase scene is more horrifying.",2023-09-10
"Almost in the Marvel universe. Should have ended with the first movie. But, the goat was cute tough. Just waiting for «the goatman and Sis Irene».In the ending of the movie, the nun looked like a beta-version of her self. And as always, they just need to pray to get the nun back to hell. And Maurice survived. So that is the reason for my 3 stars, because he is handsome. And he got to grow some tomatoes. And Susan from Narnia has aged. Wonder if she think about Aslan while she found the eyes with Sis. So, maybe the Marvel guys use the nun in a movie. Time will show. But i recommend this movie to people with Alzheimers, so they forgot they have seen this movie.",2023-10-27
"""The eyes have it."" Philip K. DickThe Conjuring universe has just about any horror trope imaginable from simple jump scares to dark chapels. In The Nun II, the Demon Nun (Bonnie Aarons) flashes some scary eyes as it shuttles from a poor caretaker to a mother superior and anywhere in between. Director Michael Chaves and his stable of writers make sure we can see as well as the demon eyes while leaving questions scurrying around like cockroaches.Because this franchise, with nine films from The Conjuring (2013) in its family, covers the horror formula, it is important for me to enjoy a facet related to my horror experience, in this case eight years of education under the nuns. Delight for me is to correlate here with my Catholic background.As seen in The Nun II, Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga) is the embodiment of good as she fights the nun who represents evil, Demon Nun Valak. So too, in my little grade school world a spritely novice captures the fancy of us adolescent boys while the eighth-grade crone nun lived to humiliate us. Despite the horror aspects, that education was first rate.In Nun II, sexuality is an underlying motif as we watch at a boarding school in France the hunky farm boy from The Nun, Frenchie (Jonas Bloquet), flirt with at least 3 of the ladies, young and old, with blue eyes and frame to catch them. He may be a welcoming agent possessed by the bad demon nun as we know from the original Nun.Mostly set pieces dominate in dusty chapel and dark passageways with no real dramatic purpose other than to scare the bejesus out of everyone.As we always suspected when we observed from our grade-school perspective, sex was going to be withheld from everyone. After all, when the crone nun publicly called me a ""dirty thing"" for holding a girl's hand, we knew sex was a long way off in our franchise and not a good thing at that.The Nun II deftly obscures one of its real subjects, the denial of sex, when it uses all the tropes available to the genre. The cinematography, with its mostly dark sets, somber blues, and underplayed reds and oranges, hides the Demon Nun and the remedy for the invasion as well as the homely embrace of sexuality, a virtue we always suspected was lacking in a nunnery.It would have been good to know more about Sister Irene's ancestry and more so about the story behind St. Lucy, the patron saint of the blind. But that would have made it easier to flesh out the eye motif I spied early on. Oh, well, enough to be satisfied that I did reasonably well with my education from the nuns. As for my healthy attitude toward sex, that's another Conjuring I suspect.",2023-09-11
"The script is relatively clear, clarifying the backgrounds of Valak and Sister Irene. Valak's purpose in this world is not just to scare like the demons in other movies, but has a clear direction and blasphemy.The good points of the movie are the clear story line, beautiful shooting angles and the actors playing their roles well.The bad points are the beginning of the film is relatively slow, the supporting characters do not have clear roles and the ending is predictable.Overall a good film in the WB horror universe. Fulfilling the role of connecting the previous films and the wrong film, The nun 3 will certainly be the film that the audience is looking forward to.",2023-09-23
"""Nun 2"" didn't quite break the mold for me. It's not great, and it falls victim to some predictable cliches. The plot feels a bit dull and doesn't bring anything particularly new to the table.The cinematography in ""Nun 2"" is commendable, with hauntingly atmospheric shots that effectively set the eerie tone. However, despite these visual strengths, the film still struggles to escape the shadow of its franchise's well-worn tropes.However, I'd say it's perhaps slightly better than the original, managing to provide a bit more suspense and tension. If you're a die-hard fan of the series, it might still be worth a watch, but don't expect any groundbreaking scares.",2023-09-15
"This is another film that could be included in the dictionary under the word ""mediocrity"";
my biggest surprise during the film is seeing Storm Reid in this film, she is a talented actress full of great work... so:
HOW DID SHE END UP IN THIS GARBAGE?Michael Chaves returns to a boring, cliche and confusing direction. Honestly, I feel like just a scene lasting a few seconds ended up having hundreds of cuts with camera changes, IT'S VERY CONFUSING AND WEIRD! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE SCENE!Without giving spoilers, the only good reason to watch this film is its post-credits scene, which lasts just a few seconds. (the duration this haunting should have).My biggest regret about watching it at the cinema (apart from the money spent) was holding back the laughter, sometimes the cliche and ""scares"" of this story make it seem like a comedy. I can say that my room had less than ten people and they were all struggling to hold back their laughter.Verdict?I laughed several times, slept quickly twice and went to the bathroom four times to avoid seeing this... this thing.Only watch if you are a big fan of the universe. Still, see when it comes out on streaming, etc.(If you expect to see horror, give up. There are NO scares!)",2023-09-09
"A slightly better movie than the first in 2018, all thanks to the photography, location, cinematography, very good Aix en Provence vibe, oldish and yellowish with nice set designs and setup.Unfortunately, the story, storyline and plots are still mishmash and mumbo jumbo, relying on semi cheap jump scares, illogical in continuity and horror-wise unthrilling or just a little scary for newbies.It goes nothing, never went nothing and as the few seconds of credit showed, it's just a matter of family exorcism priests and mother-daughter lineage and legacy in the real world.Screenplay/storyline: 6Development: 7Realism: 5.5Entertainment: 6.5Acting: 6.5Filming/photography/cinematography: 8VFX/CGI: 7.5Music/score: 7.5Depth: 5Logic: 1Flow: 6.5Horror/mystery/thriller: 6Ending: 4.",2023-10-11
"The follow-up chapter to The Nun and the 9th instalment in The Conjuring Universe, The Nun II brings back the demonic figure for another outing and features all the elements that played an instrumental role in making its predecessor such an insipid, incompetent & ineffective example of its genre. Bland, predictable & unoriginal throughout, there is nothing about this latest entry that stands out.Directed by Michael Chaves (The Curse of La Llorona & The Conjuring 3), the story takes place 4 years after the events of the first film and once again pits Sister Irene against the demon nun Valak that haunted her before. As before, the premise is weak, the setup is boring, the subplots are unnecessary, the scares are run-of-the-mill stuff, and the new characters are as lifeless as the reprising ones.It also doesn't help that Chaves is incapable of conjuring an original horror set piece and needs to rely on same old tropes & tired clichés to deliver the chills, and he doesn't excel at that either. So much time is wasted on the characters one never grows to care about and the build-up is so forced that it fails to create any genuine suspense. And the ride is further marred by the tedious pace & subpar performances.Overall, The Nun II is as uninspiring, uninteresting & unstimulating as the original and makes for yet another forgettable & underwhelming addition to the saga. It spends way too much time on subplots that carry no emotional weight whatsoever when it instead needed to dial up the eerie atmosphere, go all-in on the horror by placing Valak front n centre, and make the most of its R-rating. Neither thrilling nor entertaining, this sequel is an absolute dud.",2023-09-16
"Considering the fact that The Nun was a weak movie compared to others of the Conjuring universe, the Nun 2 deffinetely changes that.At the beginning of the movie we see two kind of stories unfolding to a great third act in which they combine and create the big finale of the film.The movie as a part of the Conjuring Universe, brings scenes, easter eggs and lore from the other movies binding them all together. This results into creating a strong plot both for people watching the Nun 2 without any already obtained knowelgde from the first installment but also for all the fans of the franchise.Nevertheless, when speaking about horror films we must consider how horror or spooky they actually are. More specific, the jumscare scenes. The movie has some well directed jumscare scenes clearly inspired by the previous movies but with a touch of uniqueness. Something to be mentioned is the scene, also seen in the official trailer, in which the demon Nun shows itself to Sister Irene through magazines. A scene that is well executed and the hihlight of the movie along with the big finale.Overall, the movie is somehting I would recommend without hesitation to horror fans and lovers of the conjuring films. Either way it is an enjoyable movie to see, especially in the cinema theatre, with an interesting plot, good visual effects and a good sence of horror.",2023-09-10
"Just like how Annabelle Creation was a great improvement on the first Annabelle Movie, The Nun II is a great improvement on the first movie. The two different storyline's merging into one was a lot more engaging and fun this time around, with it allowing us to have more fun with the character then diving into the lore of Valak. The movie also created great tension with really good scare sequences that weren't cheap jumpscare's for no reason and actually added to the story (the news paper scene especially), the actors were great, the shots in this movie were well crafted and beautiful too. Overall a great movie filled with some of the franchises best scares and connected this spin off perfectly to the rest of the franchise.",2023-09-11
"What I certainly disliked in the first Nun movie besides the multiple plot holes was the fact that the demonic force didn't seem nearly as dangerous, deadly, powerful and terrifying as it was hyped to be. The second one quickly makes up for it with the brutality of the murders from the get go. The demon was pretty damn scary and actually felt like a threat on this one. What I specifically disliked was how easily defeating Valak was once again especially after the amazing plot-twist of him getting ahold of the relic and ascending, a scene that was the highlight of the film and the whole franchise imo. I just expected it to be more powerful and wreak more havoc with the relic considering it was claimed to be ""unthinkable in the hands of a demon"". It just seemed that all this tension was built up just to abruptly fizzle out with Irene inevitably beating it. Still a pretty enjoyable film with very nice setup scares, kills and atmosphere. Also I'm pretty sure there will be a third Nun film considering Maurice evidently didnt get rid of the demon and the film didnt connect with the Conjuring scene of his exorcism meaning that there's more to happen that will lead to that moment.",2023-09-09
"Yes it doesn't have the great narrative of other Conjuring movies yet the action, gore and blood and yes acting and actors save even Meh movies like MCU yet glad they did something new and went more risky. Hope MCU learns by trying something new and letting it be different than other movies. The whole relic adventure felt like a better Indiana Jones movie and the acting is their and trying to do it in France gives the the movie fresh yet has the softness and good moments to not feel sappy. The great thing is the Catholic parts dominant feel preachy.Yes you know whats gonna happen in the future yet its still good to see Frenchy and still know the future still needed her. Such a great movie and if you dont think the others were scary enough or bloody this is your movie.",2023-09-09
"I didn't even remember much of the first nun movie so sort of went into this fresh and didn't know what to expect but I'm warning you now, don't expect anything.There is no story to speak of, just what seems like random encounters that leads to another event and a mishmash of something, I don't know what, but there is no consistent story to this, no character development and nothing to keep you interested.I was so bored I started tapping on my iPad games and all I was seeing in the background was screaming and fire and that's the gist of this movie, nothing more happens for the whole damn thing, why wste time and money on this?",2023-10-06
"Another film where the trailer is the best part of it and raises totally false expectations.Superficially it looks good then (yet another film) where you quickly realise there is no substanceThe characters and premise have been used by others ,for a moneygrab on the back of the previous films (which were written by more competent writers)Can't really say much else but need to fill the review.Perhaps the only redeeming comparison is that Cobweb is actually worse (believe it or not) So a spate of sub standard horrors in the cinemaWould I watch it again? Defintely not . 3/10 You have been warned.",2023-09-13
"This was definitely worth watching. The plot starts with powerful Villain comeback and gets you stuck to your seat instantly. Lately a lot of horror movies are becoming gross with unnecessary puking everywhere all the time, Like evil dead 2023 where the movies was less scary and more gross, BUT....! This one was pure horror no such stuff. Bang on action and scare. I just wished the audience in the theater were a bit mannered which kept passing jokes loudly trying to be cool . Destroying the Mood, maybe we got unlucky. Anyways don't miss the chance to enjoy this movie in theaters coz let me tell you the NUN is super powerful this time.",2023-09-17
"Just came back from the cinema. It s the worst horror movie i ve seen so far. It seems that these movies are made just to take your money, they add nothing new and it s just the old jumpscares that we are all used to. It was so boring that half of the people were just laughing and making fun of the scenes. I couldn t care less about the main characters and honestly, the scariest was actually the goat. I actually fell asleep for a few minutes. What a waste of time and money. Stay home do smtg better than this ... I wonder : is there anybody that is actually capable of making a really good film?",2023-09-24
"Okay so I went to see the early premier of The Nun II hoping that it would be better than the first Nun but boy was I wrong. There is no plot, and the characters aren't likable. If you were to see the movie yourself, you wouldn't feel any sympathy for any of the characters. And no, it wasn't scary either, I wanted so badly to walk out of the theater. I felt like the script was pretty lazy. The acting is bad, the plot is bad and the setting is bad. What was the point of making a sequel to The Nun? I figured after seeing the first one, that was it for the Nun franchise. And also, there were multiple scenes in the movie that didn't make sense at all. Just wait and see for yourself.",2023-09-07
"The Nun 2 is a real letdown. It's a movie that promised horror but instead delivers a confusing plot filled with senseless action. The moments that should scare are scarce and predictable, instead focusing on unexciting fight scenes. The characters are a collection of one-dimensional stereotypes, making it difficult to connect with any of them. In short, it's a sequel that adds nothing to the horror genre and feels like a desperate attempt to capitalize on the success of the first film. The pacing is uneven, with stretches of boredom punctuated by chaotic and inconsequential action sequences. In the end, ""The Nun 2"" fails to live up to even the most modest expectations for a horror movie, leaving audiences longing for a more genuinely chilling experience.",2023-09-17
"Unlike most people, I actually found the first movie to be decent- nothing great, but it was scary.This sequel has a weak plot- there's literally nothing in it. The eyes of St Lucy? Seriously?Barring two scenes, I didn't find it to be scary at all. The jump scares begin right from the start- and that dilutes the shock value for the subsequent scares and the climax.Speaking of the climax, that was weak too. It barely lasted 10-15 min and really just was the demon chasing everyone. Even the demon's end was boring and anti-climactic.Performances are okay, it's the plot that lets it down.Disappointed, but it's not terrible. Just a one time watch and strictly for long time horror fans.",2023-09-08
"I am really disappointed for Nun2..
Nun 1 is much more better , i feel nun 2 is funny and boring enough.Less than any experience ever i had at horror movies this movie has no idea and no plot.All actions are predicted already
The graphics of Nun is the same the solution for the story is silly and funny
Its only pray that solved all the problem so why all this long story and bad scienario and extra drama and many unnecessary details that made the movie very bad for me ...
I have credited 3 out 10 for nun2
Nun1 much more better and and really was perfect..
I do not know what to sad more than bad.",2023-09-11
"I was surprised that the movie was way better then expected. It felt like a little bit like ""Davinci code"" on crack and with horror elements. The only thing was the ending that felt a little rushed. Other than that it was a good movie to watch. Looking forward to the last conjuring after this. I don't know whats next for the franchise but I hope James Wan doesn't stop making horror films. Thank you for at good watch at least.I would also love to see the Farmiga sisters in the last movie, so hopefully they can tie it all together with the last flick. Good acting from Taissa Farmiga and Storm Reid.",2023-10-11
"The cinematic experience is a delicate art form, one that relies on a multitude of factors to captivate and enthrall its audience. Unfortunately, not every film achieves the heights of excellence, and there are occasions when a production falls short of expectations. It is with this perspective that we examine a recent release, a horror film that left audiences wanting more in terms of fright and storytelling. In the following analysis, we will delve into the various elements that contributed to the film's lackluster performance and explore why it may not be worth the trip to the theater.One of the most critical aspects of any horror film is its ability to instill fear and unease in the audience. A successful horror movie should transport viewers into a realm of dread, making them question what lurks in the shadows and inducing spine-tingling moments of suspense. Regrettably, this particular film fails in this fundamental aspect. Throughout its duration, it struggles to evoke the primal fear that is expected from the horror genre. The eerie atmosphere and chilling moments that define great horror are conspicuously absent, leaving viewers unmoved and unimpressed.The issue of predictability plagues this film, undermining its ability to engage the audience fully. A predictable storyline can be the death knell for a horror movie. In this case, the narrative follows a well-worn path that avid horror enthusiasts are all too familiar with. The scares are telegraphed, and the twists are not surprising in the slightest. The lack of originality in the plot leaves the audience feeling as though they have seen it all before, diminishing the film's impact significantly.Moreover, a great horror film often has a deeper message or underlying theme that adds layers of complexity to the story. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't offer much in terms of substance. It lacks the depth and nuance that can elevate a horror film to a thought-provoking and memorable experience. The characters' motivations and backstories remain shallow, and there is a distinct absence of meaningful subtext or social commentary that could have added depth to the narrative.Considering the disappointment it delivers, it is difficult to justify the expense and effort of watching this film in a theater. The big screen experience is typically reserved for films that can immerse the audience in a visually and emotionally captivating world. Regrettably, this film falls short on both counts. The lack of compelling visuals and the inability to connect with the characters make it a poor candidate for a theatrical outing. Waiting for its release on an OTT (Over-The-Top) platform would undoubtedly be a more prudent decision, allowing viewers to save their hard-earned money for a more rewarding cinematic experience.Finally, a film's director plays a pivotal role in shaping its outcome, and in this case, it seems that the director's choices may have contributed to the movie's shortcomings. The pacing feels uneven, with moments of slow build-up that don't pay off as expected. Additionally, the director's handling of the scares and suspense leaves much to be desired. Horror is a genre that demands meticulous attention to detail, as even the slightest misstep can shatter the illusion of fear. In this instance, it appears that the director was unable to strike the right balance between tension and release, resulting in a lackluster viewing experience.In conclusion, the horror film in question falls short of the mark on multiple fronts. It fails to deliver the spine-tingling scares and suspense that define the genre, relies on a predictable storyline, lacks depth, and is ultimately not worth the investment of a trip to the theater. Waiting for its release on an OTT platform would be a more prudent choice for those who are intrigued by the premise but wish to avoid disappointment. While every film is subject to individual taste, this particular offering seems to have missed the opportunity to leave a lasting impression in the world of horror cinema.",2023-09-10
"The movies just plain terrible plots rushed, poorly explained and understood, make no sense. Movie isn't engaging its boring barley passes as a thriller/horror. The dialogue is boring and meaningless adds nothing to the story. Character are killed off with no real explanation and had no bearing on the story. The timeline was scuffed the difference in time periods were not noticeable neither was change in scene. The scenery was mid at best most of the time the set it just dark. One thing that was done well were the jump scares and the suspense building I would say would say its the highlight of the movie. The production and snd planning just wasn't handled well wouldn't watch again.",2023-09-11
"The Nun 2 is a pretty much okay movie for me. Its an improved version of the first part. Though the ambiance of this movie is different from the first movie it felt good. First of all I felt the length of the movie should have been increased another 15 or 20 mins anyway that is not a problem. The movie gives a good entertainment for the time. The negative aspects I felt about the movie is the plot, though it has a high potential like giving us more about the actual story about Valak and its origin and etc. They just continue showing its killings and its returns. The story line could have been improved according to me . The story was way to predictable. The postivies I felt was its jumpscares. There were a lot of great Jump scares throughout the movie which actually really worked out in most of the scenes. The connection to other universe is also good .Finally the movie is a good watch for a horror movie. It keeps you entertained till the end. Atleast I did not get dissapointed watching it. Its a decent watch. As a huge fan of the conjuring verse I Hope they bring a deep story for their next film.",2023-09-10
"After seeing ""The Nun 2"", I come here to say that, yes! It's better than the first film. The atmosphere is very good, we have new characters, etc. I thought this one was similar to ""Annabelle 2 creation"", as it.had several girls running away from the devil in both! So, it's not a great film, but it's enough! There are problems in the script, but the performances and the ending are worth it! I'm sure Valak wasn't defeated there. That's movie is fun! It's definitely an evolution of Michael Chaves, I feel like he did a good job here. I congratulate him for that, but on the other hand, I say that Akela Cooper's script doesn't do her much good, she needs to improve! I'm not a big fan of the films that Chaves played in this saga, but ""The Nun 2"" really interested me! That's why my rating will be 7.0 for this film, it could improve, but it's still a good film in my opinion.",2023-10-11
"The movie is objectively not bad, setting is fine although I think it's becoming a little played out and stale, I don't think it's particularly explored here, it is quite monotonous and one dimensional and really if you've seen the trailers, you've seen the only parts of interest.Is it a horror? No, if you watched it at normal volume, you'd not be remotely bothered by any of it, I think a few scenes might make you jump a tiny bit but the over reliance on sudden movement and loud noise is lazy and repetitive here.The nun looked like the main player in the trailers which is what you want but sadly she's a bit part player, feels like a film that would've been a straight to dvd horror with the nun and conjuring added to it just to give it a brand. Either make them the showcase or don't trick people into seeing a film where she barely appears.The cast were mediocre, very basic acting, nothing great, nothing remotely interesting, Sophie was very sweet and probably the best actress as you care about her and her journey, the rest are easily forgotten. The girl from recent film Missing was in this, she was ok, but felt forced in to make sure a box was ticked, shame.I'd definitely not pay cinema prices for this, unless you have memberships. It's not worth admission prices at all. Lazy, pointless and easily forgotten.",2023-09-14
"I admit this is scarier than the nun 1. In terms of the story, The Nun 2 is scarier than the first, I say that, because the second film not only presents Valak as the devil but also the goat devil, the ghost of Madam and her child, and so on. My rating is 10/10 because the film is that good and that scary.and also if you pay attention at the end of the film it shows Ed and Lauren receiving a call from a priest and saying that he needs help from Ed and Lauren, wow I will be very excited if the 3rd Nun film is released. If the third film is released I will watch it with my friends.and maybe one of the scenes that scared me the most was when the goat demon chased the children.",2023-09-21
"It was just not bad but not good, for me personally the plot was a bit dragging, it was funny tho I laughed a lot to the jumpscares. I would say that it was ok but don't expect it to scare you much.It got a bit boring in the middle, the beginning was OK and the end was just really typical. I expected it to be more scary, but at last I was dissemination by that thought. So dont expect much if you don't get scared easily. I think it deserves 4-5 stars, but these are just my thoughts, but at least I got good laughter out of it. I was also waiting for it to end it was just really boring at times.",2023-09-30
"I've never seen The Nun (to be honest, I feel like The Conjuring is way over hyped and I've only liked a few of the films in the Conjuring-verse. These movies just aren't scary or atmospheric to me). So, going into the Nun II, I was actually surprised how much this film actually ""continues"" the story from the first one, as I expected a typical standalone horror sequel.This movie jumps in REALLY quickly and kind of rushes through the buildup I feel is so necessary in horror movies. There's two central locations (at the start): a convent and a school for girls, and it took me at least 30 minutes to realize these weren't the same place. Setting your film in FRANCE and having everyone speak with a slight French accent and then having a school - also apparently in France - where NO ONE SPEAKS FRENCH and half of the school seems to be full of Irish people doesn't help.Knowing nothing about the Nun II, I feel like it was basically exactly as I imagined it'd be. A paint-by-numbers, slightly entertaining, more action movie than horror movie sorta deal. There's a lot of loud noises, crumbling buildings, screams, beams of light, people being whooshed across rooms...it often felt more like a Marvel film than anything resembling horror, to be honest. Relying solely on jump scares didn't help; at least The Conjuring I and II built up atmosphere and comitted to the genre.I'm not mentioning the performances really, because aside from Taissa Farmiga (who looks SO MUCH like her mother Vera, it's crazy), no one is particularly notable here. These characters are barely given names, let alone personalities, and they feel quite disposable, as if they're the characters for a given episode of the X-Files or something, never to be seen from again. Even Maurice, a carry over from the last film (apparently) feels...weirdly underwritten for how important his character is.At the same time, it's FINE. I don't think every horror film needs to be Talk to Me or Smile, we can have a PG-13 fun fright flick for teenagers. There is some cool imagery and I think the final act is exciting and fun, if again, not scary at all. I'm also a history nerd, so the references to Saint Lucy and her persecution was pretty cool too.But yeah, a lot of this movie relies on you being scared of ""The Nun"", whom, yes I admit I'd be scared of if I saw her at night too, but in this film kind of feels goofy at times. Her overbite is hilarious and she's almost so powerful, I'd liken her to Thanos more than I would any horror icon. Within horror, there has to be some realm of believability that the heroes can get out of it and survive, but with all the magic and superpowers, I don't know, this comes off as more of a fantasy action film than anything else.",2023-09-13
"The goats red eyes shine through the stained glass to show where St Lucy's eyes relic is buried? Um ever heard of THE LAST LIGHT OF DURIN'S DAY? The nun is also giving heavy Balrog vibes when they're all tryina escape and crawling on wood planks etc. And then Irene being a descendent of St Lucy is like Galadriel being the only daughter and youngest child of Finarfin, prince of the Noldor, and of Eärwen, daughter of Olwë and cousin to Lúthien. Maybe get some new ideas guys and maybe a life? Overall I'd say it's an superb film but the lack of ideas and indebtedness to Tolkien force me to give three stars.",2023-10-22
Love the jumpscares. Tassia done an amazing job also Bonnie Aarons too. And the man played Maurice done amazing as well. The film is fantastic 👌 I would watch it all over again and again. I cannot wait for the next instalment of the nun. I'm sure the next instalment would be about the Maurice excorism next. I recommends to watch this film as it is a very very very very good horror movie. Big thumbs up. I love how Maurice saved Sister Irene in the first film and she saved him in return at the end. Amazing job. Still thinks Maurice isn't out of the possession then. Let hope the next one shows his exorcism.,2023-09-14
"The Nun has always been a low point in the Conjuring franchise. Many people, myself included, went into this film hoping to get an Annabelle-style experience where the first film failed to live up to the hype, but its sequels are solid. Unforutnately, this is not the case.The plot is extremely underdeveloped, the effects are subpar, the acting is acceptable at its absolute best and the overall tone of the movie doesn't match the intensity of any of the other films in the Conjuring universe. The last 2 Conjuring films (The Devil Made Me Do It and The Nun II) have been extremely subpar offerings that didn't meet up to the hype or expectation fans of its predecessors have come to expect.The Nun was always a real stinker, and this further drives that point home. However, perhaps even worse, given that it's the second awful entry into the franchise, it feels like it might finally be time to retire the Conjuring entirely and move on to something different. This was once a franchise with so much incredible and exciting potential, to see it slowly fizzle out like this is downright disheartening.",2023-09-21
"Compared to the first movie, which was pretty decent for a horror movie, this one is horrible. It seems to be directed by a kid, would not recommend it to anyone. The storyline was extremely.random with a lot.of.things that did not.make any sense and hat no explanation. They could have just used the possesion of Maurice for the movie, not incorporate a goat as ""the devil"" who cannot even break a door held.by one women and a few little girls. There are too many things that dont add up in the movie. This is amother example.of trying to milk the first movie, which was pretty decent. This one could have been too but it was directed horribly.",2023-09-15
"There's usually too much talk and unnecessary boring scenes in many horror movies, kind of like the first nun movie. But with this one I wasn't bored, and at the edge of my seat most of the time. I actually thought I saw the nun by the door at the cinema, so that added the extra fun. I don't really pay attention if something is wrong with the scenes, or if something in the story line is missing, but if I don't notice anything and it doesn't bother me then it doesn't really matter. I had fun and it was memorable, and for me that means it was a good movie. I need to write more letters so let me just say that the actor Maurice is so hot, and even when he was possessed he looked really good. Valak has great choice in men.",2023-09-28
"Okay so. I'll grade the movie a B. Historical context, wise, post-Nazi France. They could've made it a lot scarier. It's 1950-something, and a demon nun is running rampant, terrorizing a monastery and local church. It felt like a prequel. I did appreciate the nun's origin as a fallen angel seeking Holy eyes. It provided a lot of horrific thoughts and outcomes, yet none of which I presumed manifested. There were some jump scares. The scene with the ""goat"" chasing the students was cool. It reminded me of the other movies that featured that thing (which I rebuke). It's unfortunate knowing that Maurice was still possessed. Speaking of future timelines, I liked the glance into The Owen's from The Conjuring Universe's hallway. Or at least I thought it was, with the dated wallpaper. Anyway, this movie had great potential. Sorry, it fell short.",2023-10-14
"I was expecting something impressive from this film if it was going to be anywhere near as good as the first but no it sucked big time. I think I wasted almost 2 hours of my life watching it but thankfully I downloaded it for free otherwise I would have been really annoyed.The acting was mediocre and the storyline was almost non-existent and when there was an attempt at a coherent storyline you ended up with 3 running in their own direction.Also, Unlike the cinematic effects of the original move that were outstanding this film spent most of its time in 2 or 3 rooms and 1 courtyard.This movie probably had only 1 scene where I thought hay this is really well done and maybe I was a bit hasty to judge it so poorly but no I watched it to the very end and thougt should have stuck with my gut feeling which was, ""this movie really really sucks.Sadly, 1 scene does not make a movie so I struggled really hard not to skip a lot of the movie which was really boring hoping to find that 1 jem in the rough which I did find but of cause it also ended up in the movie promo which come to think of it was probably a good idea on behalf of the producers to sell tickets because honestly the movie was really bad especially in comparison with the first film.And the special effects of the devil thing jeez my 6 year old could do better with some play dough and paint.",2023-10-07
"The sequel, 'The Nun 2', disappointingly offers little in terms of fresh narrative or depth to the established series.It relies heavily on familiar tropes, resulting in a somewhat monotonous viewing experience.While dedicated fans of the Conjuring Universe might still find it worth a watch, it's crucial to acknowledge that this installment doesn't bring anything groundbreaking to the table.The screenplay follows a predictable path, which is understandable given the saturated nature of the genre. Also there's too much screaming and shouting. Okay. Too much.The latest installment in the Conjuring universe, gets the title of being the weakest entry thus far. The Nun 2 brings back Sister Irene, portrayed by Taissa Farmiga, as she confronts the demonic entity Valak for a thrilling showdown.The Nun 2 falls short in delivering the essence that made the original film intriguing. Excessive reliance on special effects detracts from the potential impact of simpler scenes.The climax, involving the defeat of a demon by wine, feels rather anticlimactic. Despite attempts, Valak's eerie appearance and antics still fail to induce genuine fear.Regrettably, many of the elements that elevated the first film to an underrated gem are conspicuously absent in this installment, including adept pacing, character development, a balanced mix of scares, atmospheric suspense, and a satisfying conclusion.",2023-09-11
"Fascinated, is perhaps a better word than amazed at this movie. What the director did in part 1 was only half of the story. The second part shows more about the main demon in the story, and the devil - Satan, in an animal that you already know what he is if you read the Christian Bible. This story, shows, in what I can only say, the best perspective of any movie what the demon was, and what Satan was, and how both of them worked hard together to win against the Church and Nuns. Now this is where it gets very very good: There is romance in this story, although it is not shown in a physical way from a man who you already know from part 1, and 2 women, one little girl who is his best friend, and one woman who perhaps falls in love with him later on. No spoilers here! This creates as we all know the biggest problem for a demon and Satan by love creating a real problem for them. Love is the biggest problem the Devil always knew, remember? Yes. Also, the film shows the 2nd part of what is known about the Devil and Demons: The nr 1 thing that the Devil liked, was that she said ""People believe I do not exist."" Well, in at least half of the film, the demon is hidden and 'does not exist' to the eyes, except if looked at from the side of the eyes, much like the Christian Bible tells us: He / or she is always there, watching you, stay alert or it will get you.I want to rate this an 8/10. Very very good, had a few mistakes, but not much to criticize.People who have ranked this lower than 7 or above do not understand the rules of the Christian Bible, and definitely have not read the book. If you liked Part 1, and this part, Part 2, see The Da Vinci Code and it's 2 other movies / and read the books! Great books!Enjoy!!",2023-10-10
"The director and his entire team did a good job setting up the atmosphere, sets, costumes, hue and tones, and background scores, the characters are well-slotted, having said that, it's a somewhat meager improvement over the first Nun installment.The scares aren't new and mostly pulled in from previous scary gothic and missionary horror tales.Its commendable that the writer thought of introducing Eucharist as a weapon of choice this time, but to be honest, you really don't expect to obliterate a demon Nun as powerful as the antagonist, by barrels of wine! I mean come on! I, for once, thought it to be some over-the-top mineral water advertisement, or some Kohler shower ad, or maybe some unsophisticated wannabe wine ad!They should have thought of some more scares with the demon goat creature, that seemed to have some potential though.",2023-10-06
"With half stars, it would be a 5.5Much like the MCU this latest instalment of the universe is entertaining enough, and provides what you expect from the series, but it's feeling more like a cookie cutter money making franchise filler than a solid high-quality horror movie. Considering what the three writers have produced before, it's seems like it could have been better. Possibly a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth.Although it was entertaining and had plenty of jump scares, the lack of story development or character development was the biggest issue for me. It seemed like there was more of a focus on getting as many characters and jump scares in as possible at the expense of any depth.There was no real expansion on the story of the demon Valak, or the nun character that it inhabits, and despite the tiniest of suggestions of a link between Sister Irene and Lorraine Warren, there was zero development of this spin-off's central characters.For me, Jonas Bloquet as Maurice steals the show and this feels a bit more like his film than Farmiga's Sister Irene who, until the final act, is kind of just a long for the ride. He puts in a solid performance and out of all of the characters, he's probably the one who gets to shine most.I like Storm Reid, she's a good actress and puts in a good performance as always, but her character is a bit pointless and I wonder if it was written in just to keep the social media mobs from kicking up a fuss. It's a shame because she's a very talented actress, but I don't see much point to her character unless they are planning to expand upon it in yet another spinoff, or in the next Conjuring instalment which will feature the Sister Irene character. The film wouldn't have been any different or worse without her being Sister Irene's sidekick.There are several other characters that are in there but don't really feel fleshed out enough too, and it feels like they were trying to do too much with the separate stories of Maurice and Sister Irene, that only come together in the end. I feel It might have worked better focusing solely on Maurice's story and fleshing that out more.It's a slow starter, and a little bit dull to begin with, only really hitting its potential in the last act when the film suddenly feels a bit more engrossing as it comes together. I think most horror fans will find enjoyment in it, but it's certainly not up to the standard of the first and second conjuring films and, much like the MCU, it's possibly time that they started winding down the universe to focus on fresh ideas instead of releasing as many films as possible and stretching it out so thin that they never quite get beyond average. But money talks and the $250m this has grossed so far is probably going into ensure the producers squeeze a few more films out of it before that happens.",2023-10-09
"One of the darkest films I've ever seen. That's literally dark, not thematically or tonal-wise. You will not be able to see a single flipping thing most of the time. That went from atmospheric to annoying in very short order.Other than that, I kept expecting Tom Hanks to pop in, because this is basically the Davinci Code with some demons.I hate Davinci Code.The entire established character of the Nun is ruined. No longer do we have a patient corruptor, who took a full 30 years slowly picking off the nuns one by one and who relies on building up paranoia and breaking your sense of reality with creeping hallucinations.Nope, we're now on a crash course to cannonball through Europe on a quest to find yet another relic, setting crap on fire and running rampant.The ridiculousness of this is could maybe be fun, but the movie also drops characters and consistency like it's hot. The number of school girls being saved fluctuates shot by shot, characters are introduced and then dropped, and when balancing too many people becomes too hard, they will just leave someone somewhere and you'll wonder what in the world is happening to them because the movie may have forgotten they exist for the past 15 minutes, but you haven't. The story also does not fit with the Conjuring cannon since Maurice is supposed to be still possessed in events happening a decade after this film.The first Nun has its flaws, for sure, but it was campy high drama with a medieval flavor. This one is charmless.There's something seriously wrong with a film if the scariest part is the credit montage.",2023-09-13
"Probably the stupidest horror movie I have watched this year.The jump scares were telling, wasn't surprising because you knew exactly when it was going to happen.Don't get me started on the CGI of the Nun and the stupid goat. Half the theatre was laughing... laughing at a horror movie not with it. The goat was the final straw for me when I saw how bad the special effects were on it.It does have a decent story line, but we found ourselves bored and shaking our heads after every jump scare because it was so disappointing. Not to mention how dark some of the movie is. We had a hard time seeing some parts.",2023-09-10
I think that it was scary and terrifying and I really like it the film was good and I seen it twice. I enjoyed the movie was good and I saw when the devil came out of the glass window and they were scared and they ran outside to get way from him and I want to see it again it was a good film all time but I didn't really like the first film of the nun it wasn't that good movie the second the nun 2 was good movie too see if u guys to see the nun 2 it's really good film and I can't wait to see the nun part 3 for next year for the in 2026 or 2027. I know it will be excellent film and I want to see it in the movie theater for the next year in the future.,2023-09-30
"Cookie cutter ""horror"". Really only contains jump scares.Here's my issue, how are Maurice/Valek sooo strong they can easily kill a half dozen priests and nuns but only toss Irene, the other nun, the mom, and little girls around. I mean we saw a priest spontaneously combust! Damn that plot armor is strong. I mean either take the kids out of the peak action or start killing them off. Don't expect us to buy into a wooden door holding back what is supposed to be the Devil. Others have also mentioned, how the hell did that girl get down from the tower?!? Matter of fact, why the hell didn't Valek levitate up the tower and push her off to get the eyes?!?This movie is just so cheap. First was definitely better.",2023-09-30
"The Nun movies have one very important aspect setting them apart from usual horror movies; and that is its 1950s Catholic and Gothic setting that immediately gives us a sense of uneasiness. While the first Nun movie failed to take advantage of this in any meaningful way, the second one does so decently.The narrative is more simpler this time, which I think is a good thing, since it makes the whole thing much more streamlined. It also helps that this time we have a few characters to actually care about.Too bad it's nonetheless brought down by a rather predictable screenplay, that while having the potential to be better, just ended up being mediocre at best.",2023-09-28
"After watching The Nun again the other night, I knew to keep my expectations in check, and I was right.This will be a short review as I don't feel there's really much to say about this film.I went out to see The Nun II for one reason and one reason only. Taissa Farmiga and I was not disappointed. Not only did I get more of her, but also surprisingly, a movie that was better than its predecessor.This time around, the story was actually interesting. The writing was a bit more competent, and to their credit, there is an interesting cast of characters, some better than others, though. The film has great cinematography and genuinely looked good on the big screen.Unfortunately, though, what weighs this film down is what weighs all horror films down. ""You've seen one you've seen them all,"" and there's nothing original here. Jump scares galore, granted some are well done, but nothing here made me jump or flinch. It's all very predictable, which can also be said for its story.But despite all this the film was entertaining and there was some enjoyment to be had. Overall, though, while I must admit it is better than the first, it still is nothing we haven't seen before in the horror genre.IMDb: 5/10

"Taissa Farmiga is back in the habit - taking on everyone's favourite spooky sister. The Nun 2 is exactly what you'd expect, jump scares and a mission to find a mcguffin.1950's France and other baroque backdrops provide a great creepy setting but apart from that there's nothing new to see here. I don't just mean compared to the original, but for the horror genre as a whole.However, the highlight is a new evil addition to the Conjuring-verse but you won't see them until the finale.The first one was pretty forgettable, even the in-film flashbacks barely jogged my memory. And I'm already struggling to remember what the sequel was about.Nick@WatchItWombat.",2023-09-20
Bro come on...it was just so boring and nothing was happening. The nuns were just sitting around talking the whole movie. Nothin was scary and I ain't even gonna lie...I just saw the movie and I don't even remember it because I was so bored and nothing was happening except nuns talking and walking around being nuns idk bro not my vibe and I like horror movies... tbh I wanted to see saw x but this chick I was with wanted to see this trash and I knew it'd be trash because the first one was trash...this is slightly better trash tho but trash is still trashThe film's potential might have been squandered by a slow-paced narrative. A good horror movie should keep you on the edge of your seat...not running to the bathroom to text on ur phone.,2023-10-01
"Unlike the first movie, The Nun, The Nun 2 isn't a horrible horror film, it is entertaining and has its' moments. It does contain a strong hook in the beginning of the film, but after the opening scene the film does drag and lack pacing for a little while. If you're expecting to see a horror film that is full of jump scares and craziness from beginning to the end, then this horror movie might not be for you. I did like the acting and some of the new characters and cast members that are introduced in this movie, but this is the kind of horror film that you need to pack your patience for. The jump scares and craziness are there, just not throughout the whole film, and a lot of the super intense and most action packed scares don't come in until towards the end of the picture. Once it gets going it is decent, but it's not like the first one. Before you say that this is one of the best, I would recommend for any real horror fan to watch the first two Paranormal Activity movies, you'll probably have a true change of heart, There are some scenes in this film where I look back now and realize that they're more suitable for religious education classes purposes and not entertainment purposes. This film is about how Sister Irene must travel to a different country where her friend Maurice is being possessed by the evil sinister nun that she had fought in the first film. This time the setting is at a religious boarding school. I won't give any spoilers, but I will say that if you're hit a hardcore horror fan, you will probably find a portion of The Nun 2 very boring, with some sprinkled in jump scares here and there until the end of the film. I only recommend this one for horror fans who have a lot of patience. The special effects are really good. The directing is decent and the script writing lags a bit of pacing, but does contain good character development for the new characters. There's a lot of pros and cons to this movie.Written

"I love horror movies. Its mg favorite genre. But I have to say, this movie is atrocious. Unbelievably bad plot and just a stitched together timeline of jump scares. Its 100% back to cash grab tactics as the latest entries to ""The Conjuring Universe"" movies have all disregarded what made the first conjuring movies so charming.Where The Conjuring 1 succeeded this movie fails. Instead of creating dread and suspense this movie just tries to cram in as many jump scares as possible. The characters are extremely forgettable and you genuinely dont care if they live forever or die immediately. They arent relatable, they dont make you care for them, like them, hate them or feel sorry for them because they are all boring.One of the few movies I have left because it was utterly pointless and boring to watch.",2023-10-10
"It was good but it could have been much better if the nun had more appearances than the goat or any other evil character that she adopted. In addition, it was better than the first one. It made me jump out of my seat a few times which at least compensates what I didn't see in the first part.Regarding the cast , they all did a good job which really captured my attention from the get go. As I was saying, this film could have been much better if the nun had killed more victims. As far as I remember, there were only 4 or 5 people who passed away in the course of the film.I hope that the next sequel will be better.",2023-09-10
"People who make movies like this have no imagination. The story is terrible and not believable at all. The movie is boring and very slow.At times I wanted to skip scenes because it was so slow and it was dragging.You expect me to believe two little nuns can beat a demon so terrifying?The side characters were horrid. The dialogue was distasteful.There was no shock-factor. The freight scenes were predictable.The music was just lame. I can't really think it was anything fun in the movie except for the look of the NUN in the movie.Every scene where the person is getting scared is where the amusement fades.It's a pathetic attempt at a sequel even though the first one wasn't that much better.The demon, where is the story behind him? Where are his victims? Where is the fight against it? Maybe I don't believe the cross can do anything to any demon but that's just me. I am a huge horror fan but this wasn't scary. I've seen all the horror movies. This just wasn't it. I wonder how people felt when they spent money watching it in the theater and actually got scared? I envy them....Try feedback: a 4 out of 10 for the Nun in the costume. Everything else was garbage.",2023-10-05
"The Director Michael Chaves send a warning that this movie is more violent? Lol No way the Nun 11 was very disappointing. Okay I fell asleep at the end. I never fall asleep watching a good scary movie. So today I watched the first Nun movie. I didn't fall asleep and the movie is still scary. I feel like the Director wanted a woman as the main character. She didn't need a man to help her fight the evil. Big mistake, the church would never send a nun alone, she needed a priest to help her and it would of made the story line a lot stronger. Another mistake was the young nun that came with her she was out of place, she didn't add anything to the movie. The character Frenchie was under used he could of made the bullies pay for their bulling. This could of been another great scary movie, sad it wasn't.",2023-09-10
"In Michael Chaves' direction, The Nun 2 revisits the ominous presence of Valak and its reign of terror within the Conjuring franchise. It brings back familiar characters from the 2018 original, including Sister Irene and the possessed Frenchie. However, despite some intriguing aspects, the film struggles to maintain its momentum and fails to provide a memorable horror experience. Set in a 1950s Catholic boarding school in France, the plot revolves around Sister Irene's investigation into a series of gruesome murders across Europe and her growing suspicions about Frenchie's connection to Valak. Regrettably, the movie's predictable pacing and deviation from its core premise hinder its potential to be truly gripping. The scares, primarily relying on jump scares, lack the depth that made the first film so captivating. While the film introduces interesting elements such as Saint Lucy and a holy relic, these aspects remain underdeveloped, and the final revelation feels nonsensical. Furthermore, Frenchie's character development falls short, and the plot seems to assume that viewers have forgotten the events of the original film, diminishing the impact of key revelations. Overall, The Nun 2 suffers from predictability, with viewers often ahead of the characters in understanding the unfolding mystery. While it maintains the Gothic aesthetic characteristic of the franchise, it struggles with narrative balance, heavy-handed exposition, and a disruption of established continuity. While it does offer a few creative moments and scares, the film primarily caters to those seeking additional details about the Conjuring universe, ultimately falling short of delivering a truly terrifying experience.",2023-09-13
"What a terrible waste of time. We watched the movie in 4 DX. When the special effects contains real smell of incence, fire or the smell of red wine. It would be a bit better. The story is simple and boring and predictable.Most of the special effects in the chair where funny but absolutly not scary. The actors played their parts good and believebleMaurice was a pleasant charectar to watch. The first movie was much better and contains more scary parts.When there comes another part; i hope the special effects and story will be much better and with more real scary moments.

"Ah crud, I have to say more about it... the first one at least could be relied upon to occasionally startle you. The Nun II was just a nap waiting to happen. I literally fell asleep twice and had to be nudged back to consciousness... twice. Not scary, not clever, not worth your time on any level.Crap, still need to write a few hundred characters about nothing. This will benefit nobody, what is the point of this character requirement anyway? I'm not a bot, ask me about anything! You're a bot! You're not, you're just a form, it's just fun to yell.Anyway... Nun II sucks, don't bother unless it's fee on your streaming service of choice, in which case put it on and enjoy a tranquil slumber.",2023-10-07
"""Nun 2 disappointingly falls short on multiple fronts, stumbling through a convoluted narrative with glaring inconsistencies. The characters lack depth and their relationships remain puzzling and poorly defined. The performances, regrettably, fail to breathe life into the poorly scripted roles, undermining the film's credibility.The horror sequences, instead of being spine-chilling, resort to gimmicky effects, diminishing the film's authenticity. Furthermore, the film succumbs to illogical and gratuitous plot twists, steering the storyline towards complexity and tedium.Given these flaws, it's challenging to justify a rating beyond 3. The film falters in delivering genuine scares, and its attempt to do so only highlights its narrative shortcomings. In the realm of modern horror, Nun 2 struggles to carve out a distinctive identity and significantly diminishes its watchability compared to a plethora of superior alternatives.""",2023-10-06
"I actually found the ending a lot scarier than the movie itself.They went for something different, they went for the grotesque deaths, I don't dislike it. But The Nun 2 seems more like a film with pure superhero style show leaving aside the terror that provoked the first installments of the franchise without so much CGI.I'm still scared of the character of the nun; but please, her name is the title and her scenes leave a lot to be desired, so much so that her first appearance in The Conjuring 2 is still the best. And not to mention its script, which is lousy and with continuity errors. At least I liked his post-credits scene.",2023-10-31

Gone are the days whe they made good movie for public, now big cinema houses simply want quick money. Nun2 was way below than conjuring 1 or even 2 . I wish i had not seen this utter devoid of story,music and characters movie.",2023-09-10
Finally we got the sequel we most needed and it started with a bang. The opening scene scared the crap out of me and from there it was great jump scares and creepy characters. Sister Irene played by Taissa Farmiga was amazing. Love her character and the performances were fantastic. Valak is even better in this movie. The story and direction were on point. The special effects terrifying good. This is definitely one of the best horror movies of the year. The haters are gonna hate but at the end of the day these two movies are some of the best in the franchise. I can't wait to see if we get a third movie. So definitely check it out it's worth the watch.Tim Treakle.,2023-10-30
"""The Nun 2"" left me utterly disappointed and questioning the very essence of horror. This film, masquerading as a horror flick, falls flat on its face with a feeble attempt at inducing fear. From start to finish, it seemed more like a parody of horror, rather than a genuine attempt to terrify.The central character's constant state of fright was not only unbelievable but also incredibly annoying. It's as if she had never heard of the concept of courage, and her perpetual state of fear became less of a character trait and more of a tedious shtick. There was no development or growth; she was a perpetual damsel in distress, rendering the entire character arc meaningless.The storyline, if one could call it that, lacked any semblance of coherence or substance. It was a haphazard collection of jump scares and eerie visuals, strung together by a threadbare narrative that left viewers questioning why they bothered investing their time. The plot seemed to have been crafted by someone with a fear of commitment, unwilling to explore any depth or meaning.And then there was the ending-an absolute disaster that left me yearning for the credits to roll just so I could escape the cinematic nightmare. It was not only unsatisfying but felt like a lazy attempt to tie up loose ends, leaving more questions than answers. The resolution was so lackluster that I found myself wondering if the filmmakers had simply run out of ideas and decided to settle for mediocrity.In the end, ""The Nun 2"" is a prime example of an overrated horror film that fails to deliver on its promises. It joins the ranks of my worst horror movies, a testament to the fact that even the most hyped films can fall flat on their faces. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one-it's more likely to induce groans than genuine scares.",2023-10-10
"I read several reviews that while expressing disappointment about the movie indicated the reviewers found this movie better than the first. I have to disagree. I enjoyed the first. The scenery to me was much more horrifying in the first. The decrepit ancient looking buildings, the cemetery, the Nun, especially at the beginning and then again throughout was horrifying to look at. She barely appears here in her typical form. This movie seems to attempt to horrify more with jumps and the building of anticipation, but just doesn't seem to deliver. It takes way too long to get going and then people are routinely tossed around by invisible hands and by possessed open mouthed zombie like individuals that deliver no fright value. I found myself just tuning out. I was really looking forward to this movie, but I found it a total disappointment. Even the fear of the young girls and nuns does not translate into any suspense; I just did not feel any connection. In the end this really just feels like an excuse for a remake, a bad one.",2023-10-28
First of all the nun is my favorite Demon so far.Very scary just standing there and looking.The actors were also very good.I also liked the storyline.. however I dont think it was portrayed very well.That very annoying frog sound really irritated me. It reminded me of the grudge. In none over movies with the nun appearing you could ever hear that sound.The scene with Sophie opening the door and the nun standing in Ed and Lorrains hallway. Was that a look into the future? Because that happened in the 70s right? That confused me a little.All in all it didnt really feel like the nun. It seemed more of a new movie.,2023-09-24
"Aside from the fact that these movies are chronologically misplaced making the story line more difficult to follow they completely screwed this installment up. The beginning and middle are very slow and boring, there is so much time wasted between backstory that doesn't matter and pointless conversation between characters. Although claimed to be stronger than ever The Nun aka Valek appears to be far less cunning and threatening than any of the previous installments throughout most of the film. Most of the dirty work is done during possession of ""Maurice"" making it almost pointless to even watch. Valek does make a few appearances as The Nun but not nearly enough, it was almost like the star character of this film was a background character. Very disappointing. The other ""main"" characters are extremely uninteresting and annoying. Sadly, Ed & Lorraine Warren are not featured until a brief appearance at the very end. Apparently they still haven't learned that it is a bad idea to produce one of these films without them.. The ""Sister Debra"" character was a complete utter waste of time out of the movie she played no major role and everything that she did do could've been done by pretty much anybody excluding the ending which based off of the information given on her, she should not have been able to accomplish. There was absolutely no justifiable reason to spend the amount of time they spent on her every second of which would've been better used for attacks by / more backstory on Valek. Being played storm reid really doesn't help as a young black woman would have had no place in that area of europe in that time period yet they gave her a 3rd lead role. It is clearly race pandering. The end battle was probably the most disappointing part as Valek is once again defeated, this time by 2 nuns one of which (debra) was still in training using the power of prayer... This would have been completely impossible as Valek had already defeated Irene sho wouldn't have even survived if Maurice hadn't saved her and Debra was the least committed nun with the weakest faith.. Previously Valek killed a priest inside a church yet this time despite being claimed to be more powerful than ever was defeated easier than ever by the weakest opponents yet...Inside the bowels of an ancient church that became a winery then a school the 2 sisters pray for wine barrels they found to become the blood of Christ drenching Valek and stopping the demon essentially the same way as done is the previous film just with a different approach. The most disappointing horror movies since the recent halloween movies.",2023-10-05
"The Nun 2 is a sequel to 2018's the Nun which was a spin off film set within the world of the conjuring. I haven't seen the first film and in all honesty I haven't really enjoyed any of the films in the conjuring franchise all that much so I'm not sure what possessed 😉 me to see this instalment. I think the end of August felt like a real dump when it comes to new film releases for me but this was my excuse to get back to the place I love most, the cinema!The Nun 2 is directed by Michael Chaves who also directed the last conjuring film 'the devil made me do it' which considering that state of that film I wouldn't be surprised if he did. Taissa Farmiga returns from the first film as well as Jonas Bloquet who play Irene and Maurice respectively. They're the very much the main characters of this film and I can only speculate that they probably were in the first film too. This time 'the demon' is back and is living the right wing atheists wet dream of killing priests across 1950's France. Irene is then brought in by the church to defeat the demon as she did successfully in the first film. It's hard to say much more about the plot without spoiling it so what did I think?Ehhh it's alright.... It's not offensively bad and I was never board per se but I did always feel on the edge of falling asleep without ever actually doing so. There's enough of those jump scares and tense moments to keep you awake and to keep fans of the conjuring films happy, the acting is good all round and the story is engaging enough as well. It's competent in all areas without being outstanding in any, it's not gonna win you over if you haven't enjoyed the previous films in the conjuring franchise but I think there's enough here to keep most audiences engaged for all 1 hours 50 minutes of its runtime.",2023-09-10
"I don't get where all these positive reviews come from the movie is a disappointment. I have seen each and every horror movie of the conjuring franchise and this one is one of the worst, along with The Curse of La Llorona and the Conjuring 3, all 3 movies share the same director that's not a coincidence.Everything in this movie is below average. The characters are paper thin and not interesting. The actors did what they could with the terrible script they were given. The horror scenes are not interesting and not scary in the slightest. I would frankly not even consider this a horror movie and on the third act it's too much ""in your face"" and loses what little atmosphere it already had. On the other hand, the first act borderlines in boring. Overall, it's just a terrible movie not worth watching and I really don't understand where all these positive reviews come from.",2023-09-10
"I insist in writing this review hoping that other people feel the same like me. I didn't like ""The Nun"" (the first one), I ADORED IT!! But this sequel was really bad. Like really really bad. Apart from 3-4 scenes that were cool and entertaining, everything else looked like I was watching cartoons. A mix between Witch, Scooby Doo, Robin Hood and other productions dedicated to children, the movie ""The Nun II"" WAS NOT SCARY AT ALL. And this makes me sad. I had such great expectations from this movie, but it just didn't offer anything - not a single new ideea, nothing to impress, nothing that could make the viewer forget that he is in a cinema room. It had way too much special effects, was over-directed. The actors had a great interpretation, but the way the plot was thought just didn't work. It seemed too much and because of this exaggeration it looked somehow low-budget. It just cannot be compared with the first one which is a masterpiece. So I don't know why there are people who think that The Nun II is better than The Nun, because The Nun is a 10 and The Nun II is a 1. Definitely.",2023-09-29
"Director Michael Chaves is no stranger to the Conjuring universe. He previously directed The Curse of La Llorona (2019) and of course The Cojuring: The Devil Made Me Do It (2021). Opinions vary about the third Conjuring film, but based on The Curse of La Llorona we can hope that this second film about the demonic nun will be better developed. The demonic nun made her first appearance in the second Conjuring film and her role was played by actress Bonnie Aarons. The nun turned out to be so popular and scary that the film got its own spin-off, just like Annabelle did. Aarons returned in 2018 as the scary nun, although opinions on that film vary widely. Yes, the film really had its moments, but the big picture didn't quite come together. Funnily enough, Vera Farmiga played the role of Lorraine Warren in the Conjuring films and her sister Taissa Farmiga, who is more than 20 years younger, plays the leading role in The Nun as Sister Irene. Hopefully this second film does a lot better in terms of story, because that was actually the problem a bit in the previous film.This sequel turns out to be reasonable, although the story is not technically very well put together. In the first hour and fifteen minutes, the film takes quite some time to show how Sister Irene and Maurice have restarted their lives separately. Maurice helps a learning link named Sophie, who is being bullied a lot by the other students, probably because her mother is a teacher at the boarding school. Sister Irene picks up the thread again in a monastery, until she is called by the church to tackle the dark demon Valak for the second time. This just plods on a bit and every now and then something happens, after which it slowly ripples on again. Unfortunately, Valak's appearances are predictable and that really takes away a lot of the fun. When something happens, you see the person walking to a place where it is dark, so you know that something is going to happen and then the makers try to scare you by turning up the volume. This was also a bit of a problem in the first Nun film, but unfortunately the real scary scenes are left out. While The Nun still had the scenes with the bells above the graves or the praying nuns, this second part actually has very little in the first act of the film.The second hour becomes a lot more entertaining, but never rises above itself or its predecessor. Maurice starts to come to the fore and Valak starts to make frequent appearances in the film. Yet the appearance of The Nun's creepy apparition is actually quite rare in the film, until the end actually. At some point you'll even start to wonder why the makers didn't just call the film Valak or something like that. It will all have to do with recognition and marketing and in principle it doesn't matter that much. The ending is pretty standard and follows a path we've seen before in these types of films, so don't expect any surprises or anything like that. We already know that Valak will survive, because The Conjuring 2 takes place 21 years later than this story. It remains quite strange that there has not actually been a single spin-off that has even come close to the terrifying first two Cojuring films and unfortunately The Nun II is no exception.The Nun II takes a very long, boring run-up before anything really happens. The film also takes the well-known horror movie and does not surprise anywhere. Jump scares are used extensively by turning up the sound when something happens. Well, that's not that bad, but the scenes are quite predictable and that takes a lot of the fun out of the film, because when something is going to happen you first see the victim go to a dark room, then you get an exciting music and the You can actually fill in the rest yourself. While the first film still had a number of nerve-wracking scary scenes, this second part remains fairly tame and the makers try to deepen the story more, with large parts of the film becoming quite boring. No, The Nun II is not a bad movie, that's fine with me. But unfortunately the film doesn't do very well or impress. And before I forget, of course, stay seated when the credits start, because there will be an after credit of course.",2023-09-08
"The Nun, The Goat and the Possessed FrenchieI am a big fan of James Wan's Conjuring films. Everything that came after within the franchise is of mixed quality and more often than not pretty terrible. The Nun was the low point. That movie was boring, predictable and nothing more than a series of jumpscares stitched together with a weak story. I hoped they had learned from their past mistakes.They hadn't.The Nun 2 is almost an exact replica of the previous film and brings nothing new. The opening scene alone is full of clichés and false suspense building. Immediately I had an idea of what the next hour and a half would bring and I was right. Fortunately, the rest of the film already has more story than its predecessor so that's a plus. The production also looks very good overall with foggy streets, mysterious chapels and imposing churches lit by moonlight, among other things. Some of the practical effects are also to be applauded. The cast does not disappoint either. Taissa Farmiga can't do anything bad for me. Anna Popplewell arouses feelings of pure nostalgia in me because of her role in the Narnia films. Bonnie Aarons as the titular nun is still very creepy.That's about any positive thing I can say about this disaster of a movie. Jumpscares can be seen from miles away and are not even well executed. The nun hardly comes across as threatening because she doesn't really put the protagonists in positions where the consequences are palpable. In terms of shock factor, they played it very safe. There are some good scenes but they were all already shown in the trailer. Never was I blown away. At one point I did have a little tingling in my stomach but then I realized it wasn't from excitement. I had to go to the bathroom.If you were an all-powerful demon trying to bring hell down to earth, what would you do?A. Kill everyone with a snap of your fingers and sharp teeth.B. Play endless games, hide yourself in a pile of magazines or a mold stain, throw balls around, scream endlessly without making any threatening move.I don't have to draw a picture to show which option the writers took.2*",2023-10-03
I am one of the few who preferred the original which I found more creepy and less complex than the sequel. Sometimes it's best to keep things simple.The sequel which has moved to France via the character Maurice who was in the original. There are lots of plot holes and you have to ask yourselves how they seem to work things out so easily with minimal effort and how miraculously all the dots join together.It's also strange that the the demon has no problem dispatching some characters yet doesn't seem to be able to kill more helpless victims!I would imagine there will be a third film made based on the money made which hopefully will be an improvement on the lacklustre sequel.,2023-09-21
"I am huge fan of horror flicks. The Conjuring and the Insidious sagas drew me to this one. I had already seen The Nun I and left the theater feeling utterly disappointed. The plot was weak, silly and. Boring.The Nun II is filled with cliches from previous films. Scenes are not original, but rather ""stolen"" from Annabelle, Drag me to Hell, the Exorcist, you name it, and some other much better films. They shouldn't have pushed this one so far. In the end, it is absurd from beginning to end.Even a horror story needs to be gullible enough to be liked by the audience and The Nun II fails everywhere.Do yourself a favor, stay home and have a nice meal with your folks.",2023-09-30
"Wow they could have done so, so much more with this film. I would not call this a horror. CGI?? Really? Goats running around... I do not understand who thought of that, it was very much a bad decision. I would of loved to see more of the nun and other nuns like the first movie. It was not scary or jumpy. Very disappointing film script but great actors. The church should have been involved as it would have been great to see the behind the scenes of maybe talks in the Vatican about sending Lorraine to help at the boarding school and that lead the bishop to tell her to go and investigate. Normally I love this universe but if they made a third nun I'd still watch it but please make it frightening.",2023-09-11
"If you're a fan of the first one, then I think this sequel won't disappoint, especially, sincd both the survivors from the original film are the main characters of this one too. However, I feel like they leaned towards 'special effects' more again.I thinn the reason why it's source, The Conjuring, worked during its time, is because of how realistic and simple the scares were. They leaned on surprise scares + the unknown. They used a typical horror ghost film formula and managed to still make it look fresh.Meanwhile, The Nun 2, feels too far from reach. The main plot is too ""out if this world"", which makes it less scary than it wants to be. Some scenes are also hard to take seriously. It feels as if they wanted the movie to be both for kids and adults? Or they wanted to make a fantasy horror movie adventure? In the process, it felt like a different movie. The Nun was merely the shape of the ghost, but it didn't feel like she's the face of the film.Not to say it didn't have any good scenes. I like that they had more blood & gore, which probably why they had an R-Rating.SLIGHT SPOILER One memorable scene, for me, is when the sacristan / church server kid appears to kill his mom. That was impactful.",2023-09-10
"A movie about preventing a demon from getting a holy relic, just for the demon to get it and be vanquished by wine... you may be like ""vanquished by wine??"" Yeah, sounds dumb. If I could provide a 0/10 rating, I would. Horror movies just seen to be getting worse as CGI advances, which doesn't even make sense!! Terrible directing! I wouldn't be caught getting paid to watch this movie again. I was a huge fan of the conjuring movies and the spin offs into annabelle and the nun, but this was just a waste of money. Whoever directed this needs to be fired and/or sent back to theater school. Boooooooo!",2023-09-15
"This sequel was completely unnecessary. The film brought absolutely nothing new to the table. The Nun II was not scary at all. There was few jump scares and all, but thats about it.The movie was made primarily as money grab in mind. The sequal did have much greater potential, but it lacked to ""conjure"" up a good plot. Essentially what you have is just one bad evil nun who is also an angel and demonic. Thats really it. There was no real build up at all. Also some of the acting was really bad as they seemed pretty novice actors.The actions scenes at the end saved the movie from complete fall out. Overall, I give 4/10 just for few decent action scenes at the end.",2023-09-10
"I think Nun franchise is for kids. My expectations were not high considering Nun 1, but even then I got severely disappointed. Shuchita a slow development and such a drag this movie is you feel bored. Some scenes were good but most of them are very ordinary. Conjuring franchise is very good but Nun franchise is a drag. I dropped off my 10 year old at school and went to this movie thinki g that its not appropriate for him . But frnakly this movie wouldn't have scared even a 10 year old.More often than not It seems that there would be a major scary scene and then disappoints .Story is ok but the execution is not good.I felt sleepy in the middle part.",2023-09-13
"Even as a big fan of average and below average, 5 out of 10 modern horror movies, this movie was a complete insult to watch.It's like someone cut the most forgettable scenes from other movies and pasted them together into a soulless cliché void of a new film.There is absolutely not a single interesting scene, aspect, idea or scare in this 2 hour waste of your life.The people that created this added absolutely nothing of any value to society or the viewers. It was painful to sit through even when watching it for free.My standards for entertainment are low but this movie exceeded them all.",2023-10-30
"In my opinion, the best kind of horror movie is a movie that can create fear in meaning. What does that mean, the story of the film itself can scare you, apart from the sequences, effects and music. It means that I should be afraid to think about the story of the movie. This is real fear. When a movie story has this feature, it creates fear in the audience, and now you can use surprising sequences, dark and scary effects, as well as scary music as a fear amplifier until that fear is created by strengthen it through the story and give it to the audience with more intensity. It's been a long time since horror movies forget the story and try to scare the audience by using surprise or dirty work (bloodshed and amputation), which in my opinion is not really called fear. Well, if someone jumps in front of you and tells you that you are going to sit down, but this is not called being afraid. The fear must be much deeper than these words. Now, in this movie, there are few surprising sequences, and we don't actually experience anything called fear, just a boring and long story with weak and ridiculous logic, which might hardly convince children.",2023-10-05
"A few jumpscares,not many appearances of the Actual Nun in question ,long periods or slowdome and forlorn looks.I enjoyed it,but I probably wouldn't watch it again. For me the first movie was better,this was just a little too slow and a lot of the events didn't make a lot of sense
Like why does Valak want the eyes of the Saint,like what for,what are their purpose to Valak??Its never explained
Probably have to wait for the next conjuring(which is hinted at in the post credit scene)
And diversity casting for diversities sake isn't a great idea when youre inserting an African American character into a film set during a time period that was not historically great for African Americans or any black people living in western countries for that matter,then having them play the smart-ass non French speaking, chain smoking rebel nun who doesn't even have faith ,it doesn't even make sense because she would never have even been put there in a French monistery/school to begin with and definitely wouldn't have been afforded that kind of status and leniency
Its not great but its entertaining, and there are a couple of well made scenes that were pretty cool and its well acted and presented,just needs a meatier more intricate story since we've all invested in 8 of these films now.Valak is a great Character in concept,but in story and execution, shes pretty lame.",2023-10-14
"THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I AM WRITING A REVIEW FOR A MOVIE, I ONLY SIGNED UP TO DO SO FOR THIS MOVIE. It was so bad. Some of the scenes were really pointless, I am actually surprised it has such a high rating. Actors were great but they don't make up to the boring storyline. It was really the worst conjuring movie ever, at some points it was actually funny how bad it is. It's slow at the beginning then the story is told too fast then it's slow again. You shouldn't waste your time and money to see this movie or at least wait for it to be available on a streaming service. If I wasn't in the cinema watching it I probably would just scroll my phone or do something else watching it home and turn it off later on.",2023-09-10
"If you saw a cut the best scenes of this movie as a trailer, you'd swear The Nun II would be one of the best horror films of 2023. Even with Taissa Farmiga giving a fantastic performance, it isn't enough to carry the lackluster writing and lack of an engaging plot.It's clear that Michael Chaves had a vision for this film, but it's almost as If he couldn't get out of his own way when it comes to cliché horror movie tropes. The audience is constantly left whispering to the person beside them ""why would the characters do ___?"". There are enough unique concepts and a few visually striking scenes that set the film on a path to differ from your standard 90-minute jump scare, but the lack of any real suspense or even a somewhat believable storyline quickly lead the film down the beaten-to-death road.The Nun II is still worth watching while on the couch with a few friends and some snacks, if you're looking for a horror movie where you can check your phone every so often without having to rewind. But it's nothing to rush to the nearest theatre to see before it hits the streamers.",2023-09-17
"A great horror movie, or even a simply good one, is made from much the same ingredients as any good story would be. First - three-dimensional characters worth caring about. Second - real stakes, and dynamic, challenging conflict that tests those characters. Third - something new must be brought to the table - a novel perspective, or a new take on a classic idea or problem of the human condition. Something for the viewer to latch onto and really think about. A great work of art doesn't have to be overly moralistic or come with a gift-wrapped lesson or takeaway for the viewer, but they do need to present some sort of an answer to the question: why should I care? The Nun II, unfortunately, lacks any of the above ingredients and settles for being just another forgettable film in the Conjuring Universe. I'm sure it will make a lot of money, at least!In the Nun II, a sequel to the Nun, and prequel to the Conjurings I, II, III, the three Annabelles, and the Curse of La Llorena, the Vatican calls upon Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga) to investigate a rash of grisly killings that are the suspected work of the same demon that wreaked havoc on the French countryside in the first Nun. Alongside a rebellious Sister from her convent (Storm Reid), Irene travels - from Italy, it seems - to Paris and then a small French boarding in order to track down and stop the Nun, and also reunite with Frenchy, her friend/savior/artificially accented groundskeeper from the first film.Besides a few jump-scares that clearly took time to think up and some hard work from the set designers and VFX team, this movie fails on a few fundamental levels. First, there are no real stakes for the protagonists, or even the demon at the center of this film herself/hisself/itself(?). It is never in doubt that Irene will prevail over the Nun, again, from the outset with the only questions being how? Where? And how much collateral damage will the demon cause?It's a shame that this film wasn't better, because the writers were blessed with some strong source material in the form of the story of Saint Lucy, a second century Roman martyr who, at the age of 21, was sentenced by the Governor of Syracuse to be defiled in a brothel for refusing to burn a sacrifice in honor of the emperor. Oxen were carted over to take her away (and couldn't), the Romans attempted to set her on fire (she wouldn't burn) and she was ultimately killed via the horror-script-ready method of a sword through the throat. In the fifteenth century, details surrounding Saint Lucy's torture via eye-gouging and the removal of her eyes become part of her mythos, and this detail plays a central role here.The acting could be worse, but it can be hard to appreciate a cast faced with performing such a corny script. Taissa Farmiga portrays a mixture of stoic bravery and (understandable) fear throughout. At the end of the day, though, I was left with the thought that the Vatican could probably do better than Irene as a demon-hunter. Her character's haphazard ""investigation"" of the demon's reappearance consists of little more than showing up somewhere, having a vision or (in the case of the librarian) getting a lucky tip on where to go next, and then basically just . . . Showing up, running around, and hoping things turn out for the best.Storm Reid, whose emotionally charged and impressive performance in just a single episode of the Last of Us led to a well-deserved Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series, is forgettable in this one, largely thanks to the script-writing. We are introduced to her as an elder nun at the convent chides her for failing to go to confession, and moments later she is smoking a cigarette(!) and reveling in her rebelliousness, which seems like a stretch for a novice at a convent and isn't of much import later in the plot.Kate (Anna Popplewell) and her daughter Sophie (Katelyn Rose Downey) are a mother and daughter (also teacher and student) duo at the boarding school that serves as the ultimate arena for Irene and the demon to duke it out. Both turn in respectable performances, but their relationship with Frenchie (Jonas Bloquet) is a bit forced and features some cringe-inducing dialogue that is out of step with the rest of the movie and more appropriate for a Hallmark movie or insurance commercial than a big-budget sophisticated horror film.Finally, the nun herself. Played by Bonnie Aarons, she is creepy, if at times so candent and make-up laden that she seems like a wholesale CGI creation, not something played by a real human being. With regards to Mrs. Demon Nun, the scriptwriters unfortunately declined to think through or properly explain her: (1) powers; (2) goals; (3) backstory; and (4) what is behind her hunt for the relic that serves as the impetus for this entire story in the first place. My personal theory is simply that the demon is bored and likes messing with people. How else do you explain appearing in a painting only to burst her face several feet through it (to scare someone, rather than just killing them); orchestrating a magnificent page-turning spectacle at a news-stand that results in a collage of magazine creating an outline of the Nun, (just to scare Irene, instead of harming her), appearing in the form of wall mold and statutes (just to inflict more fear) and also apparently morphing into a goat-man-devil, the headmaster of the school's son, and later the headmaster of the school herself, just to scare some folks. Is Hell like the world of Monsters, Inc., powered by scream energy? Not clear.As an aside, the opening scene (which ends similarly to the memorable opening scene of the recent Evil Dead remake) kicks this story off by showing that the Nun, when she wants to be, is a cold-blooded killing machine, making her other choices throughout the film even more puzzling.In terms of technical notes, I would not necessarily recommend seeing this film in Dolby, as the sound production is overwhelmingly loud and every noise from the turn of a head to a bird flying by is backed by an incredibly loud bass boom. Early on, a few of the scenes shot in the streets of France actually seem to try and place the viewer in 1950s France, but the writers quickly forget about that and return to jump-scares or one of the half-dozen scenes in this film where a character sees someone walking away from them like a stiff robot and decides to follow them because, why not?!Overall, the film is another installment in the vast Conjuring universe and puts forward a few decent jump scares with some filler in between that isn't absolutely terrible. Unfortunately, it fails to present a coherent plot with stakes, logic, and characters that anyone would actually care about. Nor does it leave the viewer with a sense of terror that lingers a single step outside of the theater, as there is nothing to relate to in this film.Final Recommendation: 1 out of 5 stars. Would not recommend for anyone besides die-hard fans of the Conjuring Universe.Bonus nit-picks
The (FRENCH) priest and (FRENCH) altarboy begin the movie by speaking accented English to each other in the church (in FRANCE!). Why? This is a decision many scriptwriters choose to make (See: Beginning of Mission Impossible, Dead Reckoning), presumably because they think the audience is too dumb and/or lazy to read some subtitles. At the same time, however, why not just tell us where the action takes place and have them speak normal English then? Moreover, it seems like the scriptwriters played accent madlibs in this one, as Frenchy and his love interest in the (FRENCH) boarding school have Irish accents, Irene and Storm Reid's characters sound American, and we have a potpourri of other accents and dialects sprinkled in, in addition to--at one point--actual French!What was Irene's plan? She found Saint Lucy's eyes, dug them up and just stared at them awe until she was attacked by the possessed Frenchy. Then, he ""died,"" came back to life, and she basically handed the relic over to the Nun. Why? What is her actual skillset as an investigator? She seems to have just lucked her way into ""defeating"" the nun twice.Frenchy appears to have the hots for a teacher at the boarding school and also genuinely cares for her daughter. Recommendation Frenchy: Maybe you should stop doting on the kid in front of all her bully friends and they wouldn't bully her quite as much.The blonde boarding school student who pulls a buggy prank on the headmaster ends up having cockroaches spit in her face by the Nun. This is karmic, but why is the Nun even bothering with it? The girl is awful throughout, sure, but is payback for that prank the Nun's top priority?The cursory discussion of faith and religion between Irene and her friend is so shallow and boring that it would have been better to just remove it and just show more of the Nun playing hide-and-seek with her victims.The boys in France, instead of playing soccer, just kick the ball up and down the street. Although I think they were just a vision Irene was having (or something) . . . That's not how kids play.Frenchy offers to teach the little girl how to throw a knuckleball? Again, we are in 1950s France - not America. How would he even know how to throw a knuckleball or play baseball?Post-WWII France, Europe, and the history of the Catholic Church offers so much good material for horror that goes unused here, it's a shame.",2023-09-09
"Now, for me, the best parts of the movie were the beginning and the middle, the ending left me feeling a bit underwhelmed.The horror genre over the last few decades have started to introduce a comedic element in their movies, and the The Nun II is no different.The balance between suspense and comedic value is just right for this movie, but it kinda makes it more of a thriller than a horror.The actors believed they were who they said they was, the use of CGI has helped them increase the shock value.I liked the characters, but as usual, there has to be an element of stupidity in order for the movie to move forward, which had me asking myself ""why"".... ""Why are you going in there and ""why are you doing that? "" For me, it takes away the suspense notion.The majority of the movie is set in 1 location A boarding school in France. The cinematography and set come together fairly well. It felt like a small place in the French countryside somewhere.Overall it was a ok watch, not something I would see again simply because there was nothing new in this movie that I haven't seen before but I think the new generation will enjoy it because it is very modern in the way it is shot.",2023-09-08
"""The Nun"" is a chilling addition to the Conjuring universe that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats. The jump scares in this film are expertly crafted.What sets ""The Nun"" apart is that it manages to weave a story that makes sense within the larger Conjuring universe. Fans of the franchise will appreciate the connections and backstory it provides.For those who've followed the Conjuring series, ""The Nun"" is a must-see.It is a worthy addition to the Conjuring Universe, delivering spine-tingling scares and a visually stunning Gothic atmosphere.

"The Movie Was Average At Best , It has better characters and Story Than the first film but dosent really execute that well , the jump scares shown most in the trailer so if you seen the trailer you know what's coming and if you haven't seen the trailer it's very predictable what's going to happen the one main problem I have with this movie is indeed the ending the way it ends I think is laughable I dont get these reviews that say it's way better than the first film it may be very slightly better but to me the first nun was more enjoyable and ended in a satisfying way don't go into this movie with high expectations like I did as you will be very disappointed.",2023-09-08
"The first Nun movie was somehow bad, however the 2nd one is absolutely terrible. The plot is soooo slow paced and boring, focusing way too much on the relation between Maurice and Kate and Sophie. There are way too few jumpscares, and 80% of them are already revealed in the trailer. Also, all of them are so intuitive, cliche and ... not scary at all? Terrible cheesy acting, with random characters: Debra, the nun who represent a minority has nothing to do with the movie, she has no role or real purpose there, same as for Sophie. The demon survived being splashed with the blood of Christ but got destroyed by some wine, even after it got the ""great power"" from the eyes of Saint Lucy. This action movie (you simply cannot consider the nun II a horror movie) ends in a really obvious, lame and cliche way.I wouldn't recommend even if you've seen every single movie available: it's just not worth it.",2023-09-13
"""The Nun 2"" is a continuation of the film ""The Nun (2018)"", which was a huge success in the Conjuring universe, but the film was heavily criticized, for being a film made up of jumpscares.. Don't be afraid, Michael Chaves It promised a scary film & with a good story, let's face it, But Nun 2 is still the same thing as the first film, It's not scary, Just made up of weak jumpscares, The Nun's character is so saturated that they had to create another one villain in the middle of the film.. The Nun barely appears in the film, the nun has only 6 scenes in a 1h50m film Sister Irene and Maurice are the best characters in the film, because ALL the characters have terrible development, ""The Nun 2 "" It was proof that The Nun has become a saturated villain and that she doesn't need more films Because we all get sick of this villain who could have been used more... She had 2 films and both were simply ridiculous and boring, if the Universe calls do Mal continue to be directed by Michael Chaves, I'm sorry, but the films are going to become terrible! ""The Nun 2"" Manages to Surpass the First Film, But It's Not Too Hard Because ""The Nun (2018)"" Is Horrible, Is It Worth It? If you want to have fun and don't care about bad scares all the time, yes you will like the movie... But they are cliché and weak scares. I do not recommend. 4/10.",2023-10-11
At one point of time i totally forgot I am watching a horror movie. Valak was scary but not scary in story. Only in climax i realised okay this is a horror movie that to a medium level horror film . The cinematography was bad sometimes in a dark theme suddenly bright light hitting our eyes many audience felt the same it hurts ur eyes . It is like u r looking at the sun directly immediately u wake up in the morning. It was like that in the torch light scene. I thought I was the only one who got confused about the storyline after 30 minutes of the movie but not just me everyone of my friends felt the same . It could have been made a good film but enough of this director time to change him . Lots need to be changed even the Conjuring 3rd part was a let down . So James wan should take up this Conjuring universe.,2023-09-07
"At first I was really into it. We saw at the end of the first Nun how Maurice was possessed by Valak. And Maurice has been on his own since then and Irene took her oaths with the Catholic church and has been a nun. Well they get reports that all these people have been dying and they attributed it to Valak because the origin point seemed to be Romania where the first film took place. So Irene sets out to find out what's going on. Maurice has stopped at this boarding school and is the caretaker. It's revealed that Valak is after the eyes of St Lucy. Now according to Christian stories... And I say stories because no one really knows the truth because the event was told to generation after generation after generation and who knows if the story is even still the same anymore... St Lucy was this woman who supposedly had her eyes gouged out and they attempted to burn her alive however the wood would not burn so they thought she had this power or whatever. And because her eyes were gouged out, they attributed the eyes of St Lucy as being this great relic. And the whole time I was thinking okay it makes sense that Valak wants to destroy the eyes so that the descendants of St Lucy can't have the relic anymore. Going by the logic of the movie, it would be some kind of protection for The descendants. But at the end, Valak picks up the vial that holds the eyes and, possessing Maurice, his hand starts to burn and I thought maybe because they can sense something evil is holding it. But then Valak takes the eyes for herself and it's like she becomes this all-powerful being like... What?? You're telling me the vial itself will burn the person holding it but the eyes, which are supposed to be more powerful than the vial, don't do a damn thing to Valak?? The vial can sense evil but the eyes can't ? I don't know, it made no sense. I can understand in the first one the blood of Christ being powerful against the demon, because Jesus is God, but the eyes of a saint? Saints were just people. Regular people who had a strong faith. That doesn't make them all powerful. And it's like if God is protecting these eyes then Valak should have been vanquished the second the eyes entered her body, right? Anyway Irene saves the day with her faith, turns the wine into the blood of Christ and sends Valak back to hell, and then there's a post credit scene with Ed and Lorraine answering the phone and father Gordon is asking for help which the director has said leads into Maurice's exorcism so Valak isn't actually out of Maurice which makes zero sense again. The story was a mess. But the suspense and the tension and the camera trickery, all that was great. I was just left more confused than when I went in.Oh and out of the blue, the Father that Irene consults on the history of St Lucy casually mentions that Valak is a fallen angel and is only controlling the demon nun, she isn't the nun herself. So maybe because she used to be an angel, that's why she could have the eyes... I don't know, I don't know what the point of the eyes were to begin with because at the end of the day they're just eyes from a person, not God..Were they supposed to help her find all the descendants or something? And what does she even have against the descendants of St Lucy? Like, was Valak just planning on hunting down every relic that's potentially protection for Catholics? I don't know, like this whole thing was just weird.And at one point, Valak killed a delivery kid just trying to stock a pantry and I was pissed off because nobody ever found the body or mentioned that the kid had died, it's just like whatever, a death just to have a death. I don't understand why people like to see kids hurt, I'll never grasp that concept.Effects, acting, directing: Great
Story - Messy, awfulZERO reason to kill a kid.",2023-09-10
Although they did a good job with the storyline connecting the two films together overall it didn't do it for me. Like another reviewer posted Valak (the Nun) barely had screen time. The jump scares we're just not there. I could tell by the movie audience being mostly quiet through out the entire film. It's a very so so movie. I enjoyed the first one way better. Nothing really scary about this one at all. Pretty flat line. This gets a 6 from me while the first would be a 7.5/8. No claps or cheers from the crowd at the end is another sign of how the people felt about it. Hopefully they redeem them selves at a later point.,2023-09-10
"I absolutely disagree with others saying this was better than the first part. An absolute lie! The first part was MILLION times better, it caught you unprepared and held the sinister terror for longer, made you feel tense and the suspense was quality. As all sequels, this has turned out to be a failure. The 'devil' in the form of goat was more like a circus show... 2023... are we really this out of ideas and cannot think of anything scary? A goat? Really? Poor performance from the director, to say the least... disappointing, I had high expectations but this turned out to be a fiasco.The storyline itself was okay until the part where it was revealed quite straightforward as to who is carrying the demon's essence.Honestly disappointed.",2023-09-24
"Do not waste your time or money to go and see this movie. It's too long. CGI is awful. Acting is subpar. Writing is AWFUL. The first 3 minutes should've been the end of the movie. It's not scary. The jump scares are sparse and predictable. The first nun which was not good was better than this mess. I was bored and could've slept if my theatre wasn't laughing at the awfulness of this movie. This movie was so NOT HORROR that someone brought their four children all under the ages of ten and none of them screamed, not even once. This whole movie could've been avoided with a water gun of wine. The nun 2 gets exactly that.",2023-09-16
"There are 5-6 jump scares.I don't think this movie was worth the 5-year wait.I feel like the nun in this movie has the best role and I say that ironically because
We saw 2-3 scenes of her in total and that's it.As I read some posts she was chosen because she has scary facial features and as a nun she looks very scary. So I have a suggestion for productions out there.I look like Jesus Christ, so they should cast me for a role as Jesus. XD.I look like Jesus Christ, so they should cast me for a role as Jesus.

"Okay so we picked up from the first movie...I get that.. but the entire movie was NOT THE NUN!! Only the dude who was possessed at the end of the first movie.. I know because I watched the first movie before I went to see this one so I'd remember what happened!!There's only the creepy inappropriate relationship between the possessed dude and the little girl 😳
I don't think this movie was all that scary really.. no NUN!!! Where was the Nun?? Sophie is probably the best actress in the movie 🤔😲 I liked the movie don't get me wrong but I don't think it was nearly as good as the first movie.. not sure where it goes from here 🤔",2023-09-14
"The Nun 2 is easily the worst horror that I have seen in 2023.Unfortunately it has been directed horribly and instead of fleshing out more of a story / lore behind Valak, which is what everyone wanted due to that being what was lacking in the first movie, the Nun 2 felt like a montage of jumpscares which were completely predictable throughout.They had the opportunity to build up more of a story behind Valak and the possession of Maurice but instead went down a route of cheap jumpscares.The ending alludes to a third movie and I sincerely hope they finally give justice to Valak's character and create a film which doesn't feel rushed and filled with unnecessary jumpscares.",2023-09-15
"The first Nun was horrifying in that it wasn't scary in the slightest. It was 100% cheesy jump scares that anyone could tell were coming. The Nun II however, got in to being actually creepy - with bone cracking, demon goat chasing, incense burner bludgeoning...and more. I just wish they would have added more Valak. It took that dang demon over half the movie to even show itself entirely. And then it was so easily defeated - by prayer. Like really? After all that ...after obtaining the most powerful relics to help it regain its lost power...some wine defeats it. So, the end is definitely lacking. But overall, it was entertaining enough.",2023-10-29
"Amazing movie. Excellent characters, good plot, interesting scenes. The scenery was very cool.Some weird religious stuff, but I'm OK with that. Amazing movie. Excellent characters, good plot, interesting scenes. The scenery was very cool.Some weird religious stuff, but I'm OK with that.Spoilers...
In the context of the current ""culture"", I loved the cool integration of the black lady, zero forced inclusion, she was such a perfectly organic character that I got mad to not see her at the end. She almost died fighting the demon to be ignored like that at the end.I'm not a fan of the devil nun, I think her entire character is nothing else than spoilers of her face.The cameo, meh, could not be more irrelevant to me. But I guess that is fanservice. That's for Rosita.",2023-09-23
Dumbest horror movie I have seen in a while. The start of the movie had absolutely no impact in the slightest. I was freakishly confused if it was a ghost movie or a zombie film. The possessed man wasn't even convincing for it looked like he was more a zombie without a brain rather than being controlled by an entity. The goat + zombie principal attack should have been introduced earlier rather than simultaneously while the zombie & nun where attacking full power. It disturbed that entire essence of horror intensity and made it look foolish.Please don't watch this movie even by mistake the trailer got me good. Instead of shivers I ended up having the biggest laugh.,2023-09-09
"The script for the Nun 2 was just terrible, vacillating between a horror movie and a Nancy Drew episode with such corny dialogue and a sidekick wanna be nun that had no point to the story whatsoever except to show diversity? I felt badly for the actress. You think she's gonna have a point to the plot with the character's setup but alas nothing but running around w a bunch of school girls. Although I love Taissa Farmiga, there's nothing compelling about her in this role. It's like she wants Irene to be sweet yet strong but she's got a weak delivery. Her sister Vera, is much more suited to the horror franchise I think. I gave it a 6 for the directing. The jump scares we're good (yet predictable) but the story was all over the place. So not a 10 fir the director and maybe a 3 for the crappy writers who wrote this. But then again, they're striking for more money. Maybe write better scripts first. Anyway, the Nun 2 was just ok not great.",2023-09-10
I came out of this feeling really disappointed. The trailer once again made this look excellent but alas the film was mediocre.The jump scares didn't really jump and the story line wasn't exactly gripping. This didn't need to be made they should have left it with the first far more superior movie.The acting is good but it's let down buy the clichés you can see the jumps coming a mile off. And at one point me and my wife looked at each other like we had both fallen asleep as something happens which didn't really explain itself almost like we were in a trance.And the whole thing just seemed to dark to the point your squinting to see what's on the screen at points.I'm so disappointed I love the conjuring universe but for me this should have not been made it adds nothing to the mythos of the universe.,2023-09-09
"Yes. I said that. They introduced new elements (goat I'm looking at you) that were really surprising. The story could be predictable but still enjoyable. The characters were interesting enough for me to care about.The strength of the movie is definitely the story. I've always complained about how shallow the Conjuring stories have been (Red Door being the worst, just a cash grab in my opinion).The visual effects and sound design are never a weak point on these movies; but a story needs to be well structured for that to matter.Starts a little but confusing if you watched The Nun 1 a while ago, so go to YouTube for a recap because don't waste your time with that one.Maybe my expectations were so low that I was surprised but hey, even made me write a review because I don't think the score y'all gave this movie was fair. It definitely deserves better.Don't get me wrong. This is not gonna go down as one of the best horror movies in history but you can tell they worked really hard on every sense to kinda redeem themselves from The Red Door lolI have seen soooo many horror movies since I was kid so my spook-o-meter is not the most reliable thing for a review. Nothing scares enough to make me jump but there were a couple scenes that got me a lil stressed there.I am an explorer head so adding Indiana Jones elements (As Above So Below did it great) was one of the cool things about the movie. (I don't think that's a spoiler)Aight. Needed a sign to go see this? This is it.",2023-10-07
"Okay so my friend and I haven't seen the other movies which is most likely part of the problem but you can't be for real with all these goats and nuns. I understand the concept of suspension of disbelief and maybe having seen the other NINE movies would hep us understand what on earth is going on- but it just all feels very convoluted and like most of the scary parts are stemming from shock value and ""what's the craziest thing we can come up with??""I will say after seeing a little behind the s ends thing about the magazine scene, I was intrigued as to what this movie was about. And while the scene was interesting and cool on the big screen, it just didn't make the $50 worth it. We saw it on some weird 2x screen which, save your money, please. I'm so serious.",2023-09-14
"""The Nun 2"" left me with mixed feelings. While I was excited to revisit the eerie world of the Valak, the demonic entity that haunted my nightmares after the first installment, I couldn't help but feel a tinge of disappointment. This sequel was just about okay.The original ""The Nun"" set a high bar for atmospheric horror, but ""The Nun 2"" seemed to lean too heavily on its convoluted storyline, leaving the scares in the shadows. The plot was complex and ambitious, attempting to expand the universe of the Conjuring series, but it left me wishing for more of the spine-tingling moments that made the first film memorable.The character development was somewhat lacking, and the scares felt forced at times. The film struggled to maintain the same level of tension and dread that its predecessor effortlessly achieved.That said, ""The Nun 2"" did have its moments, with some visually impressive scenes and a few genuinely creepy sequences. The production design and cinematography were commendable, and the cast gave solid performances despite the limitations of the script.In the end, ""The Nun 2"" missed the mark set by the first film. It felt too preoccupied with expanding the Conjuring universe's mythology at the expense of delivering the visceral scares that fans of the horror genre crave. It's an okay watch if you're a die-hard Conjuring series fan, but don't expect it to haunt your nightmares like the original did.",2023-09-15
"Post World War 2 setting, this movie gets a lot of things right. For me, a Horror flick set within the confines of Christendom are the best ingredients for a relatable horror film that has the right amount of creep factor and jump scare.Unfortunately, this movie leans super hard into the victims have to be the dumbest people on the screen trope. You hear a super creepy raspy voice in a dark hallway, you have to investigate. A ball gets tossed back from an impossibly black room that you cannot see into, lets investigate. You're chasing a group of kids who inexplicably disappear into thin air. Lets investigate. You hear the laughter of your very dead child, lets investigate. The only reason why the Demon racks up a kill count outside the initial priest is because everyone else rides a short bus.For the faults of the script, the acting is really well done. Taissa Farmiga is pretty great in this movie. I just can't get passed how dumb everyone is written to be.",2023-10-30
"What is there in the movie? What is the story? It is not at all impressive and. Do you think people will scare for the jumps without proper or real horror from the characters ? It's not worth it.

I love the NUN character but it is not impressive. James Wan created the NUN character . It's a great character but not executed well in this movie please use the NUN character for better story , not like this, you are ruining my interest.

"Although it's a far better movie than its predecessor, this movie made me feel frustrated, not for what it was but for what it could have been.Overall, there were some great shots and great lightning; the CGI was really great in some moments but felt dull in others.The story didn't feel compelling enough for me to care for the characters; thus, when they were in danger, I honestly could not care for them.I didn't think the movie started well. I mean, in ""Nun"", her power was to move around, in the first 5 minutes, she spontaneously combusts. It is completely disproportionate since her power isn't explained or established.The movie fails to create a narrative that convinces, as the acting from some actors was pretty passable.Overall, it's not a bad movie, but I can't say it's a good one either.",2023-09-18
"This was probably the second worst movie in the conjuring-verse, only slightly better than Chavez's other offering, The Curse of La Llorona. This guy just doesnt understand how to do horror. Faces peaking from the dark, creepy hands emerging from the shadows, such generic ideas but without building any tension/atmosphere.This movie finished what the ending of The Nun (2018) started, removing all the dread that came from encountering Valek, turning them into a generic Hollywood monster as opposed to a menacing/mysterious force of evil. Add in a spunky/quippy side-kick and a precocious child who's more heroic than most of the ""heroes"". Seems like the ""Marvel-fication"" has finally fully leaked into the Conjuring world.This movie does a great job of telling, instead of showing, spoon-feeding information in the most basic way. At one point the protagonists are speaking with a record keeper for the Catholic church, he says he's a ""glorified librarian"" and can only speculate as to the demons intentions. However, he then goes on to explain in perfect detail what Valek is doing.In summary, another disappointing entry to the universe, ruined by poor direction, lazy writing, and an identity that struggles to establish it as a supernatural horror, monster movie, or mainstream action flick.",2023-09-12

"In the first movie of 2018, there was a thriller scenes that can't be forgot
The scenes of wood, scenes of grave with knocking bells,
The father bruke which was a great actor
Everything was amusing
In the Nun II , there is more of a horror but not a thriller scenes, there is just like every other ""ordinary classic horror story""
I thing this movie of 2023 is downgrade of the great one of 2018
I disappointed really
Alot of scenes concentrated on horror like the scenes of girl peoples who were attacked by the ""goat devil"" were merely a commercial waste scenes added no but a lower rated quality of the NUN II.",2023-10-04
"I liked it, yes they could do better, that was my expectation.Our horror hero kills some people easily and scares others to death. (I don't understand).And they destroy it in the wines, can people like the nun be destroyed by the influence of wine, so are they stupid enough to approach the wines?Something that is not in the theme at all, a goat or something else, something that is not clear what it is. I don't think anybody expected that.And most importantly, someone tell me, maybe I didn't understand. Why doesn't anyone go out to escape?The finale shouldn't have been this easy or they should have given a sign for the III movie.",2023-10-19

Give reviews in 350 wordsChatGPT
""Nun 2"" is a sequel that had high expectations to live up to after the success of its predecessor, ""The Nun."" Unfortunately, it falls short on multiple fronts and left me feeling like it was a significant waste of time.One of the most disappointing aspects of ""Nun 2"" is its lack of genuine horror scenes. The original film had its fair share of terrifying moments, but this sequel fails to deliver any spine-tingling or truly frightening scenes. The scares often feel forced and predictable, relying heavily on jump scares that have become a cliché in modern horror cinema. As a horror enthusiast, I found myself yearning for the eerie atmosphere and tension that made the first film memorable.Another major drawback of ""Nun 2"" is its lackluster storyline. While the original movie had a compelling narrative that explored the origins of the demonic nun Valak, this sequel feels like a rushed and uninspired attempt to capitalize on the success of the first film. The plot is thin and fails to provide any meaningful backstory or character development. It's as if the filmmakers decided to prioritize cheap thrills over a cohesive and engaging story.In addition to the absence of horror and a weak plot, ""Nun 2"" fails to evoke any genuine goosebumps or moments of dread. The atmospheric tension that is a hallmark of effective horror movies is sorely missing, leaving the audience disconnected from the events on screen. I found myself more bored than scared, which is a cardinal sin for a horror film.Perhaps the most damning criticism I can offer is that I simply did not enjoy watching ""Nun 2."" The pacing is uneven, with long stretches of dull exposition followed by brief, unimpressive scares. The characters lack depth, making it difficult to invest in their fates. The film's attempts at humor fall flat, further detracting from the overall experience.In conclusion, ""Nun 2"" is a lackluster sequel that fails to capture the essence of its predecessor. It lacks genuine horror, a compelling storyline, and the ability to elicit goosebumps or genuine scares. Instead of building on the success of ""The Nun,"" it feels like a rushed and uninspired cash grab that ultimately left me feeling bored and disappointed. If you're a fan of horror, there are far better options out there to spend your time on.",2023-09-20
"Just a pass, it had so much more potential.The slow start makes it a bit hard to get through but when the plot is finally known it becomes a great film. Lots of build up tension with good jump scares. Only slight disappointment is that only 2 people have an actual character development while the rest just jerks along.Also worth mentioning is that the ending is a bit predictable and also a little sudden. No further connections to any of the other films so that the look your face matches with the main character. Douptful and confused.Still I think its better than the last Annabel, but a little bit worse than the first Nun movie. The best portayal of the Nun is still in The Conjuring 2.",2023-10-06
"The movie is a typical horror movie, you can expect every scare jump and where the demon will appear. In the cinema there were no scared people for a moment you will forget that it is supposed to be scary.The visuals are of good quality. I did enjoy the movie but it does not reach the climax as the conjuring series does.There are many gaps In the story where I felt it should be explained.I guess there will be a third movie to highlight more on the story. There are too many characters in the movie that will not add any value. The ending of the movie was simple.I have this movie a six for the good Acting.",2023-09-07

"The first nun, (2018) wasn't a masterpiece at all but I don't think it's as bad as it's people make out. I did enjoy it and would definitely recommend to the conjuring universe fans as the interconnecting stories and are certainly interesting. There were many cliche horror jump scares and the story was okay, however did feel slightly like and afterthought. But it seems like this set the scene for the second instalment. I really did enjoy the nun 2. The atmosphere was already there from the first and was majorly improved on in the second film. The story was interesting and many things about the nun and the characters backstories are explained. The frightening and intense scenes were filmed well.The cast were really good and the acting was great, especially Taissa Farmiga as sister Irene.I did worry a bit when I seen Michael Chaves as director, but I do feel that he has vastly improved his game in the horror world and has made something very enjoyable and a good entry into this great universe.",2023-09-17
"This movie is absolutely amazing. I love that the major characters are more impervious to death by virtue of being major characters. This movie takes itself very seriously, and it has every right to do so. I mean who doesn't love a horror movie that takes it itself so seriously but presents things in idiotic fashion and expects the audience to respect its seriousness? The movie's most triumphant moment is the revelation of how the demon got its yellow eyes. It was a clever fan-service and adds tremendously to the lore of the Conjuring universe (chef's kiss). At this point, one would assume that in the following Nun movies, it would eventually explain why the demon chose to disguise itself as a nun. This is an enigma that begs to be explained.",2023-10-30
"I believe the first movie was actually much better than this one. It was scarier, there was more to the story line, more about the demon Valak, more about how and why it was conjured. The Nun 2 doesn't add anything new. All you need to know it's in the first film. The Nun 2 has some good scenes, the goat is especially frightening, but it just tells the story of what Maurice or Frenchie is doing basically, after the events of the first movie. It wasn't necessary at all. It would have been better to show his exorcism as shown briefly in The Conjuring (the first movie). Hope this will follow soon.",2023-09-11
"I wanted to like this film, especially as it has Tiassa Farmiga from American Horror Story and Storm Reid... However, it took a while to pick up and whilst it was watchable in a ""I don't have to think too hard"" way, it wasn't scary in the slightest.Here's a brief lowdown of the strengths and weaknesses of the film;Strengths:
A couple of good actors in itSome nice filming locations...The goat demon was coolThere was a cool bit with a news standWeaknesses:
The demon nun looked like playstation 3 in game graphics. It was distracting and looked awful. Surely an actor could have been used? If anything, that would have been more unsettling.It was slow to startI don't know if anyone else noticed it, but Maurice has terrible boundaries with Sophie. It's not appropriate for an adult man to be that close to a kid he met through work. It's probably just lazy writing though, to make him seem more likeable.It attempts jump scares, but they don't really work with the editing.",2023-09-12
"I had hopes. Trailer was promising but, I'm sorry. This was, yet, another terrible sequel in the worn out universe of the conjuring.Every jump scare was damn near predictable. Almost fell asleep more than once.I really tried giving it a chance...The fear factor was practically the same level as an episode of scooby doo.The big studios prove again why most of their horror films are money grab pieces of junk.The good stuff is either foreign or coming from the indie market. These sequels, prequels and threequels are now just good films to pass the time or escape the heat on a hot day.So, the nun 2, another disappointment that had me fooled by a good trailer.",2023-09-09
"Based on the first film my expectations weren't too high, however I thoroughly enjoyed this film . The plot felt very unpredictable which led to the jump scares being great ! The sound effects felt super realistic and left me feeling on the edge of my seat. At first I wasn't sure how the second film would relate to the first film without being too similar, but ended up being a great sequel and I feel was excellently written as the films connected very well . However the ending did have me asking for more and I hope there is a third film as i was left still asking questions. This is a definite must watch is you are a avid horror movie watcher like me :)",2023-09-16
"The Nun 2 spoiler free review!The starting was nice. The first half wasn't boring, it was decently good, with some cool jumpscares n' scenes. The scares throughout the movie were nothing special. In fact, I wasn't scared. Although the visuals were not good, the story was really solid. After watching, you'll say it switched from horror to action, supernatural or a creature type of a movie which personally I wud never want to see. And I think Michael Chaves forgot that it's a demon and not a Marvel creature movie. I don't think The Nun should get any more movies till they atleast get the basics of what a demon is n' does and how to make a movie really scary right. And Michael Chaves should not work in The Conjuring Universe anymore, he's made The Conjuring 3 like an action movie and same for The Nun 2. It's upto to James Wan now to bring back The Conjuring Universe. So overall I wud give this movie 5.5/10 and I am forgetting whatever happened in this movie bcz this is not how Valak the demon has attacked in the past. This is just the imagination of a person like Michael Chaves who does not know the spirit world and is just guessing how it wud be in reality.",2023-09-12
"It seems like they established an amazing franchise with the first appearance of the NUN. But now it seems like they wanted to make a ton of money because no one really cared about this script. While all the visuals are superb and the nun is definitely terrifying. There is no challenge to these characters. It seems like every time they're trying to find something it's sitting right there. Everything is on the nose. I follow the path of this movie but don't care like I did in the first film. Which is hard to believe with so many talented actors and such beautiful cinematography so again, I blame the writers.",2023-10-29
Having kids in horror films is a strange choice sometimes. This film starts with the immolation of an adult then switches to being focused in an all girl boarding school. The filmmakers are then hampered from doing anything like that first scene again cos.. you know... kids. And knowing that means the film is robbed of any tension and struggles to provide the scares you would expect.Also the ending is weird. A happy ending can only ever be temporary given what we know that Valak is in films set decades later as well as another character. But the film never addresses this which makes the end feel unfinished.Still this is better than the first Nun but the bar was never set that high for this sequel.All in all... worth watching if you catch it on a streaming service you already subscribe to but you wont be missing much.,2023-09-09
"The Conjuring Universe to this day is still my favourite Horror movies series, unfortunately James WAN's Absence is very much noticeable in these past few entries in the series, the director of this movie also directed The Conjuring 3 and the Curse of La Llorona (by far the worst movies in the conjuring universe) So when I found out he was directing this movie I have to be honest I didn't have high hopes. The Nun II didn't really give me the ""conjuring feel"" nor did it have me at the edge of my seat and the characters just felt lifeless. Please Bring James Wan back as his directing just gives absolute magic to these horror movies. I gave this movie a 5 star rating purely for the Cinematography.",2023-09-07
"Is this a masterpiece? No. But I don't think it's trying to be.I felt the movie was much more paced than the first one, and I believe (hope) it's a fair conclusion of the chapter.Taissa Farmiga is a very good actress, and she never disappoints.I must say I cringed a bit for the goat-man, due to the annoying and cheap quadrupedal stance made by a bipedal, but other than that I appreciate the jump scares.That's what these movie are about and if you expect more... we'll, the disappointment it's on you 😜
I've appreciated the Lorraine photogram to tie up the whole ordeal, felt if was not in your face and obvious.It's definitely worth to watch!",2023-10-27
"Currently writing this as I am watching the movie at the cinema because I've got nothing else to do. The only reason I give this a 2 and not 1 is because of the somewhat original jumpscares, which enhance the cinema experience but even that is generous. The plot is exactly what you would imagine a horror with religious aspects to be, the acting is poor to say the least, every scene is predictable. You can easily tell that they are trying to milk the Conjuring verse as much as possible and are rapidly running out of ideas. Don't waste your time. If you're planning to watch this movie, do it as a joke, maybe bring something to ""enhance"" your experience or a date to keep you occupied.",2023-09-13
"I had been eagerly awaiting ""The Nun 2,"" having rewatched all the Conjuring films to refresh my memory and get in the mood. Unfortunately, my anticipation was met with profound disappointment. Not only were the six friends who joined me at the cinema bored, but the entire audience seemed to share our sentiment. Half of them dozed off, including some of my most easily frightened friends whom I had persuaded to give the film a chance. To my surprise, they, too, were unimpressed and not even remotely frightened.The film dragged on interminably, and, as a devoted cinephile, I contemplated leaving the theater for the very first time in my life. ""The Nun 2"" deserves a rating of 0.1 out of 10 points. It fell far short of its potential and failed to deliver the spine-tingling horror that the Conjuring universe is known for. A colossal disappointment.",2023-10-10
"I was pretty excited for this movie after seeing the initial trailer release. The first Nun movie was very underwhelming, so the trailer certainly provided enough evidence that this, part 2, would be an improvement.Working as a direct continuation to the first, I was hoping there would be a more in depth storyline, either discussing the history of the Nun's past, or the Devil himself. Even showing more of how Sister Irene has been affected by the first movie's events, would have worked better. Instead, it felt like we were provided a never ending, merry-go-round of your typical Horror movie scare-setups.The Nun 2 does have a few successful scares, but has too many failed attempts, which just become comical moments in the film. Overall, I do think it's a fun watch, you can tell they tried to get a little creative, but just does not live up to the hype from the first trailer release.",2023-09-08
"It had some solid jumpscares, but that's about it when it comes to the upsides. The plot was interesting as a concept, but the execution was poor to say the least. Scenes that were supposed to create a dramatic, unexpected ending were mostly funny. I didn't feel like the movie had anything new to offer, which wouldn't be an offence in it of itself, but what it did bring to the table was boring, funny or simply too predictable. The nail in the coffin was the satan goat that looked like the original design of Sonic in the new movie 💀Still, I've seen worse ones. But there are definitely better horrors to spend your time watching.",2023-09-14
"I swear I seen the Nun more in Conjuring 2!!!!!!This and the first Nun movie were pathetic to be completely honest
They aren't scary t all and they didn't make me jump once so a real sad excuse of a horror movie to say the leastI thought this would be good but unfortunately it was just as boring as the first one and If I hadn't paid to watch it then I would of just walked out and gone homeLike I said You see more of the Nun in Conjuring 2 and its much better
This movie didn't even have the wooooooooooo noise when Valak appeared so that was another let downLame Lame Lame and I will never watch it again.",2023-09-09
"Much better than the first one, The Nun 2 managed to give me goosebumps due to the soundtrack, Sister Irene is a very charismatic and engaging character, Maurice here is not just comic relief he is now a very interesting character, Valak in my opinion is fine more hideous than the first. Unfortunately not everything is perfect, due to some things that are poorly explained and also due to the character of sister Deborah. But the film is very good and is certainly one of the best films in the conjuring universe!This is also the best film directed by Michael Chaves, he directed The Curse of La Lorona (2019) and Conjuring the Devil Made Me Do It (2021), here he improved a lot in directing, it seems that now he realized that emulating the Magnificent James Wan is not It was a good idea, even though he slipped up on several occasions, you can't deny that he improved a lot!",2023-10-04
"It is a vast improvement on the first instalment, of that I think many can agree. But if you go into this film thinking it was not going to be a film that has lots of jump scares and was going to be something completely different to the first then I'm afraid you were going to come out the other end feeling disappointed. I enjoyed this Film I thought the actors and the director did a great job. If I have one complaint, and that goes for many recent horror films is that the ending wasn't the best and could have been better written. But other than that I couldn't fault it. A very easy watch and like I've said a few good jump scares included.",2023-10-19
"My standard for the first Nun movie was high! Last Halloween I created the Nun haunted walkway. I had the costume and music. The whole 9 yards. We saw this movie yesterday and was surprised how long it took to get through the story. We understand the story had to be addressed. But shouldn't have taken so long. The acting was good, the jump scenes were so-so. I would wait until you could watch it at home. Frenchie's possessed self wasn't frightening at all. Seeing sister Irene's blood line was a good part to the story. Now it makes sense how Lorine Warren's history started. Her bloodline follows Irene!",2023-10-03
"10/10 ! ... This is a very artistic and refined movie! It's so good it makes the first one seem like a bad joke. It's full of extremely interesting and artistic cinematography with some very smart visual effects done to a very high standard. The decor is very detailed and feels authentic. It's also full of tense and dark moments but without cheap jump scares and without feeling cheap in any way! The actors are perfectly cast in their roles and their acting is exemplary! I'd go as far as to say it's even better than The Conjuring movies. Definitely worth going to the cinema and I can only hope that it's a success because it feels so refreshing to be completely surprised by such a high quality artistic movie when in all honesty I was expecting something ""cheap"" ! To the creators and cast of this movie... I say, ""Bravo!""",2023-10-06
This is not a horror movie. The scariest part is the end credits . Everything is so cliché. The American gaze on France is starting to get on my nerves .Maurice ???? Really???? Where is my baguette?The script is over complicated for nothing . Everything is over highlighted by musical effects.The nun is popping once in a while to remind us what we're supposed to be scared of. And the final scene is a big ball of soured soup.By now I thought those script writers would have understood that a good horror movie is a simple story wrapped in a creepy and uncomfortable atmosphere.US horror movie is starting to decline . Time to turn to others countries.,2023-10-08
"I was excited about this movie and ignored the reviews. I popped popcorn and turned the main lights out (only had my theatre lighted on) to really set the tone (I really love horror movies). I will keep it simple. This movie was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO predictable. Did I get my point across? Then, the story just kept going down hill. I was hoping it was just the first half and then boom! It would take off but good gosh it did not! I really expected an Annabelle type situation here where the first movie was bad and the sequels actually got better. But I will dare argue that this sequel was worse than the first...and I really did not like the first.",2023-10-31
"Michael Chaves is here to remind us all that the horror genre really can be spectacularly mediocre. His third entry in the Conjuring motion picture universe - because calling these movies cinematic would be charity even Mr Beast wouldn't perform - shows us all why he's stuck in this hamster wheel of creepy-but-too-dark-to-see-anything sub genre of sub horror.It does pick up some pieces of interesting set piece action with weird grumpy goats and a lot of glowy-eyed chase scenes that remind you how horror is often at its best when not taken too seriously, which unfortunately is exactly what this film does for the first two acts. Any opportunity to be a bit daring with the dialogue or have scenes sit with tension are gone, because all Chaves seems to know how to convey fear is to have French nuns peer into dark hell rooms with no help and either get mauled or slightly spooked.If you want a quick nod off in the cinema or want to feel your bones brittle from the thrill of a 5/10 experience, then the Nun II has it all for you.James Wan, where did you go?",2023-09-12
Part two I felt like definitely redeemed itself from the first part.They went back to the nuns original look which is what made the character creepy to me and I felt like they learned from their mistakes from the first movie and listened to what the audience actually wanted.I enjoyed it and I was actually interested in the story this time plus all the gore and scary scenes made my heart jump or stomach turn some.As someone who's seen over 100s of horror movies this movie is worth a watch and isn't a waste of time.As I love all the conjuring movies and spin offs.I look forward to seeing what the next installment has to offer.,2023-09-27
"Just too much! I had been looking forward to this movie ever since it was announced, and I loved the original. However, while ""The Nun II"" contained plenty of action, I found plot and character development to be sorely lacking. As a result, I was confused as to why all the action was taking place, and found myself slowly losing interest. Rather than providing the audience with an interesting story, they saturated the film with meaningless CGI action. The sets were ideal for a creepy movie, and there are some creepy moments, however, overall I found ""The Nun II"" to be downright boring and a complete misfire.",2023-10-30
"Maybe it felt like it kinda missed something but still I totally loved it //SPIOLERS:: I kinda hoped they'd show more about moris and Eiren later on or even got together they had the chemistry!! I was kinda hoping they got together but anyway, you can't tell at the end eiren knew the demon wasn't fully gone which is why we're expecting a continuation,// overall really enjoyed it but it missed something didn't fully leave me satisfied but it's good like it had thriller and jump scares although I felt it was a thriller more than a horror but I'm not complaining though don't misunderstand, last but not least I loved it and I don't understand the low rating!",2023-10-09
"This film is very good, a lot of people complain about the jumpscares, more for those who love jumpscares like me, I loved the film, this film fixed a lot of the mistakes of the first film. I hope there's a 3rd movie. There was a scene in the film that was the scene from the books, what a well done scene, the tension was very well built, and then came the jumpscare. Many complained about the ending, but I loved the ending, it was a little cliché, but nothing that got in the way of the film. Excellent horror film, it surpassed the first one, but I also loved the first film, so I have nothing to complain about. We noticed an evolution of Michael Chaves as director of a film in the franchise, as Curse of the Weeping Man was a terrible film, and he managed to make the film The Nun 2 very good.",2023-10-16
"After seeing the first one, I expected the film to be something more in-depth and profound this time. In my opinion, in a film like this the fundamental thing is to immerse the viewer in a dark, anxious, mysterious and unpredictable atmosphere, but this was not the case. They really went too far in terms of special effects, the film became almost comical. The nun figures, appearing from the darkness do not impart the right level of ""fear"" they should convey. They almost look like flat, jumpscare-style images. Furthermore, the resulting characters seem almost ""ignorant"" in deciding what actions to take, as if they are out of touch with the world and what is happening. An example is the little girl, who, despite having seen highly disturbing things several times, almost seems to have no symptoms in this regard or even just get the idea to go and talk to someone about it.",2023-10-13
"My honest review for the nun 2 is that it was better then the first film And honestly me and my two friends that were watching it with me really enjoyed it.The jump scares were amazing, and some points in the film made us all start yelling what the hell (in a good way). Personally the nun 2 has probably made it into my top 20 list.Some parts did get a bit confusing but honestly the confusion was taken over by fear especially with the goat like I understand that it was 'the devil' but why was it there and why did it come to life? But I can't lie It was scary when it was walking along the stairs and it turned it's head to the camera.Another thing that confused me a bit was father Burke. I just felt like his death was a poor cover up for him not being able to be in the film because he was working on other projects.Honestly though those two things are the only things that really confused me and this film was still amazing even with these parts in it. I gave this film an eight because it is a mean of different ratings I gave it based on jump scares, music/sounds etc.",2023-10-29
"The Nun 2 was much better than the Nun by far. I've never been more interested in a movie sequel than this one. The connections it also had to Lorraine Warren and the end scene was amazing little details. I think the story of the nun 2 was just phenomenal and the characters were amazing and I think it was pretty scary and there's nothing more I would expect from a horror movie about a nun. Overall I think the movie was great in my opinion, better than the nun which was okay. Obviously this is just my opinion if you didn't happen to like the movie The First Time watch it the second time and really enjoy it.",2023-10-29
"Scary nuns creep me out anyways but this was done very well! Love that Vera's daughter plays younger her. Can't believe the director is only 38 and this was one of his first major horror movies...boyfriend and I both thought it was well made and thoroughly enjoyed it. The movie is like a second prequel to The Conjuring Movies. If you want to be really scared, this is the movie for you. Waited until Halloween to watch which didn't make anyone jump less... but by all means don't wait until next Halloween because any day of the year, this movie will freak you out and give you a good scare! And I seriously watch every horror movie and series and this is now in the top ten of my favourite horror movies. More please Michael Chavez!!!!",2023-11-01
"The good news is that the movie does not suck. Not completely at the very least.When I saw that a trailer was released a few months ago I was quite sceptical and surprised that a direct sequel to the first installment would be released, as in my opinion there was not much to tell from this side of the story, as seen from the ending of The Nun. Well, unfortunately my fears proved to be well-founded, as the plot is quite bland, predictable, and frankly quite unengaing. In general I don't mind linear storytelling, the issue here though ist that everything seen in this picture has been done thousands of times before, especially in The Conjuring franchise, with the usual jumpscares and high notes to keep the tension going.Don't get me wrong, some scenes were indeed quite memorable and well-executed, like the magazine kiosk one for instance, but in general this movie lacked one fundamental trait that truely characterized the first installment: atmosphere.The Nun (1) oozed atmosphere like very few horrors I have seen recently (The Lighthouse or Underwater come to mind), as the isolated Medieval/Transylvanian setting was a key component of the mystery that was to be unravelled - all highlighted with an adequate soundtrack and sound design, which all contributed to make the experience quite immersive. Here instead both the soundtrack and the setting (1950s France) feel quite bland and anonymous, leaving very little weight to the viewer after the movie has ended - at least as far as I am concerned.The most negative aspect though of this is sequel are the characters, or to be more specific the way they were written. None of them are ""unlikable"", and the casting was done quite correctly, nevertheless they are so plain and stereotypical and predictable, that they had my eyes rolling in few instances: Sister Irene is exactly the same character as the previous chapter, the supporting characters have the same motivations/personalities/attitudes of the other Conjuring movies, while Valak is... Well, Valak. Just to make things clear, I actually enjoyed the first installment, and one of the strongpoints, besides from what I have mentioned above, was the constant, malignant presence and influence of the titular character throughout the movie. Here though ""Our Nun"" has so little screen time that it negatively reflects on the magnitude of the threat it poses, despite the fact that the demon manages to exert its influence in more brutal and less subtle ways compared to The Conjuring 2 and The Nun.And after a while I came to realize that most of these issues were already present in The Conjuring 3, which was directed by Michael Chaves as well...So, is it all garbage? Not at all, even though I personally was not as hooked as the previous chapter, which, I repeat, I actually enjoyed, The Nun 2 is nonetheless a decent, watchable horror flick for halloween season. I still believe that The Conjuring franchise has a lot (?) of potential when it comes to horror, I just wish that they strived for less predictable stories and more consitent, higher quality entries in the future. Only time will tell.",2023-10-12
"The first feature film from director and writer Kyle Edward Ball -- he's also made a proof of concept for this movie named Heck and the video for Craig Moreau's ""It Aint Nuthin'"" -- Skinamarink finds its origins in Bitesized Nightmares, a YouTube channel started by Ball that visualized nightmares contributed by commenters.Shot in the Edmonton, Alberta home that Ball grew up in for $15,000, this has all the buzz of a major debut. And that fine, as it has a definite feel for the weirdness that is within the darkness and long hallways and how terrifying it is to be a child. But then it just goes on and on, with arty shots of Lego blocks and upside down rooms and people with no faces played over cartoon soundtracks and hiss and static.There's no narrative here and the idea that keeps getting pushed -- ""Two children wake up in the middle of the night to find their father is missing, and all the windows and doors in their home have vanished."" -- would not be easy to find unless you knew it going in.It's the kind of film that would wow your film school professor at ten minutes but at 100 minutes, this is the kind of movie that has one frightening thing: looking to see how much time is left throughout the film and feeling like more time keeps getting added and you must push yourself like some kind of marathon runner just to endure its endless repetitive layer images and noise-filled audio.This is a movie filled with jump cuts for people above jump cuts but who can proclaim it as cinema.This is a movie for people to feel good about themselves for liking it and being ahead of people who ""just don't get it"" (see We're All Going to the World's Fair).This is a movie where people will tweet about how it changed them and they can't shake its darkness but it's all just words like fever dream, slow burn and takes chances which are just Film Twitter words that really are sound and fury signifying nothing.Just imagine: You put a whole bunch of quiet scenes together, then turn on the lights and get loud. Of course everyone screams.Much like the worst of elevated horror, it all goes back to bad parenting. I mean, those Legos aren't going to clean themselves up. ""Somewhere in Dreamland"" is a cartoon from the past which is very hit the nail on the head in this. And I really dislike the fake grain and pops added to this, like something out of that fake grindhouse trend a few years ago.The real terror within this movie is just like how Host won't stop replicating as inferior Zoom horror movies, I'll be sent so many movies next year that just stare at an old toy for an hour while someone plays an xylophone in the background and makes coffee, but shot on an old PXL2000 camera and a Casio soundtrack. Get ready for so many press releases that start with ""Influenced by Skinamarink.""I think that Ball has something in him as this movie sets up some interesting things and then never delivers on them. It's just waiting for the next scare, almost like a deconstructed horror film that's above simple scares yet uses them repeatedly. He said about this movie, ""Shooting a movie in the house you grew up in about two characters that are more or less you and your sister, I didn't have to try to make it more personal-it just sort of happened. And then an added benefit was my mom had saved a bunch of childhood toys that we used in the movie, so it got even more personal.""I'd like to see that movie, because I have no idea if any of that came into the film, so this feels more made for the artist than the audience. And then the audience wants to feel like an artist and champion it and feel superior. But it's truly a slog, a long death march where I felt like I had to finish it and make it through and when the end credits came up, it really did feel like 572 days long.I mean, if this was made with a camcorder and a $300 budget in 1984 and released on Tempe Video, I'd probably feel dfferently about it. I'd also defend this if it were directed by Bruno Mattei and stole most of its soundtrack from Phantasm.I feel like this was my Jacob's Ladder and I'm still stuck watching it.What do I know?Whenever I eat haute cuisine, I'm always starving afterward and have to stop at a gas station and get several hot dogs off the roller.You can learn more on the official site for the movie.",2023-01-25
"I went into this movie completely blind (as I try to do with most movies) and can say without question this is NOT a movie you want to go in blind. This movie is extremely experimental and abstract and will not be to most people's taste. The entire film is shot with a grainy vhs type look and is comprised of deliberately off center shots of the interior of a house. There is virtually no plot to speak of and most of the 1 hour 40 minute runtime is composed of random shots.I love films that challenge and are demanding to the viewer. I love independent cinema and slow burn films. But this film expects WAY too much from the viewer and becomes very irritating as a result. Even to the hardened art house viewer this movie expects too much. This would have made a brilliant 40 minute short as there are moments of true horror but they are surrounded by random repetitive imagery. At no point does this movie pick up pace or have any sort of narrative.This movie feels like a nightmare ASMR or a full length creepy pasta. If you suffered from night terrors or sleep paralysis or experienced childhood trauma I think you could become extremely invested in this film and that is the only way this works. I didn't feel connected or engaged in the story (I've never been through any of the above) and the only film I can compare with regards to the pacing and somnolent effect this movie had is ""Beyond the Black Rainbow"".Five points for originality.",2023-01-23
"????? ?????? Don't even know what to say Some loved this movie. Some hated this movie. I fall inbetween. It's less a movie and more of an abstract art piece of different (very dark) shots and clips of things happening (or not happening) around a house where the windows and doors mysteriously vanished leaving 2 young children trapped inside with...something. It's extremely boring, nothing happens on screen, but I do have to say the jump scares got me GOOD. Some parts were very creepy and it had great atmospheric potential and I could see the vision they had, but it felt more like a grad school project with a budget of $10. It's Paranormal Activity's less formed, visually darker, weirder, younger sibling. Art is great - but when a movie relies too much on being abstract, they forget to actually create a film.",2023-01-18

Supposedly a study in childhood fear, blah, blah ,blah, don't you be fooled by critics. This thing stinks. I was thinking that it must be some kind of joke that the film makers were pulling on me trying to make me into a jerk for watching this piece of junk. In a semi full theatre i was waiting for mass movement to the exit so i could join them. No such luck. We all sat there like morons waiting for something, anything to happen. No such luck.

"First, let me preface by saying that I have been an artist my entire life. It's what I did for a living, and I love art and creativity in all forms. But this is not art.Skinamarink is a really creative creepy concept executed in perhaps the worst way possible. It is long, boring, and not particularly pleasant to look it. It made my eyes tired...straining to see if anything was happening, which of course, nothing was.If this were made as a 30 minute short it would have been pretty good. But 2 hours of grainy footage of mostly static images was just way too much for me. It actually gave me a headache.",2023-03-21
"Well, there are three types of viewers that come out of a viewing of Skinamarink. First we have the people who praises it as the next best thing since sliced bread. Then we have the people who absolutely detest this movie. And lastly there are the people who respect the effort and the new approach but felt that there is a lot lacking. I'm leaning towards the latter. Yeah the movie has an interesting presentation and some neat sound engineering. But like others said before the 100 minutes runtime is stretching the goodwill, even for people who are familiar with arthouse movies.The movie has a lot of gaps in it's narration and it's up to the viewers imagination or personal experience to fill those gaps and ultimately enjoy the movie. For some people it hits very close to home and they have no problem doing so. Others are bored to tears. So I have to admit, it is a unique movie in it's own right and I highly respect that, although I personally didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted.It shares certain similarities to a videogame called Gone Home. It also plays in an empty house with missing parents and you have to figure out the story by pure observation and patience. But it had a decent story and an interesting ending. For people who are disappointed by this movie for the lack of a coherent story but like the ambience, I can recommend at least this game.",2023-04-22
"If I would have turned this in as my final assignment back in film school I would be an accountant now.I saw a trailer for this film and it looked freaky. I liked the grainy film look and the audio was a bit haunting. Of course the trailer states that this will be the scariest movie I have ever seen... I was not expecting this to be the case but thought it may be entertaining. I was wrong.... soooooo wrong.Two minutes into this ""film"" I was bored already, but hoping that this is going somewhere. Ten minutes in I was really bored, but was hoping this would go somewhere. Thirty minutes in I was disappointed with myself that I spent the past 30 minutes watching this horrible waste of time.There are many, many other films that are way better than this mess and much more worthy of your time.I was fortunate that I saw this ""film"" at no cost, the only thing wasted was my time.",2023-01-24
"All the people saying this film is plotless are wrong. There is a plot here, although it is extemely vague and thin. Might be one of the thinnest plotlines I've ever seen and that is what caused the film to be at times unbearably boring for me. I actually enjoyed the aesthetic for the film, the faceless characters, the low light, lofi camera work. It's a style that could present a high creep factor with the proper story to go along with it. This is not that story.I will say this is much better than the director's previous effort 'Heck', which is basically the short film that started this one. It feels like the director has a better grip on the style he's presenting here. That still doesn't make up for the lack of story here.The film opens with one of the children falling down the stairs and this starts the chain of events that make me believe the child actually died when this happened and he is living in some purgatory or hell. What follows after this could only be described as mean spirited and harsh, but it unfolds so slowly that you feel like you're just watching paint dry. There are some suitably creepy moments but they are few and far between. Actually there is maybe about 3 or 4 creepy scenes in the entire film, the ending being far and wide the most uncomfortable. Had me looking over my shoulder as I was leaving the theater.(I had the whole theater to myself, I'm assuming due to bad weather, but it was probably the best way to watch this film as isolation is a major theme.) The ending felt like I was being personally talked to by the faceless, out of focus boy and I hated it, but in a good way.All in all, I still couldn't call this a good movie and it will only appeal to a very niche horror crowd. I commend the director for creating something so different. I just wish there was as much thought put into the story as there was in the shooting style.2 portals out of 5.",2023-01-18
"I finally understood what many felt when they saw Caveat. The difference is that Caveat has plot devices, a story, a main character that demonstrates what he feels and relatable, it has disturbing images and sounds and it goes somewhere. It's also very efficient creating suspense and tension. I can't say the same about Skinamarink, which is mostly boring.Here we have a set of disconnected images that never manage to justify the existence of a long feature film, let alone its duration of almost 100 minutes. The last 5 minutes are fine. Unfortunately, by the time we get there, our minds have travelled and travelled, as it is impossible to hold on to empty space and empty content.",2022-12-08
"Although the title of this review may appear unkind, it is nevertheless, apt.I really wanted to like this film but ended up bored and angry. Angry that the filmmaker had been so self-indulgent as to presume the audience would be able to withstand 100 minutes of this punishment.I admire what he did, the execution is excellent and I was immediately drawn into the atmosphere that the film exudes. However, as other reviewers have noted, this would have made a decent short film, maybe 20 minutes. As it stands, it overplays it's hand dramatically and had me begging to be relinquished from the monotony of the long takes which comprise the film's bloated runtime.My hope is that Shudder cuts it down significantly before it has an official on-line release. It's too bad. It really does tap into something visceral and primal.",2022-12-10
"In the words of Abe Simpson: ""I've coughed up scarier stuff than that"". Skinamarink is a bland, pretentious, a film experimental only on the patience of the people who are watching it. It's all mood, no substance. It's proof you can make a film without a tripod or a light or an actual idea. I nearly fell asleep. I tried to leave early after 35 minutes of nothing happening, but ended up finishing it because the waiter didn't bring me my check until it was almost over anyhow. No, it's not just ""not for me""... it's an awfully done film who can only find an audience in people who like liking things that are anti-mainstream. It tries so little to be anything how can you love or hate it? I don't hate it... you didn't love it. I just nothing'd it. The audience I saw it with had 3 people walk out, other people saying ""I guess the face at the end was scary"". No, people, you aren't wrong... it was utter garbage with a good trailer. It was a feature film with 10 minutes of content. It sucked, that's not a controversial opinion.",2023-01-20

I watched it at night to get into the horror atmosphere and I struggled not to fall asleep throughout the whole thing.It's a shame, because if you cut out most of that dead air there are moments of pure horror that genuinely freaked me out. Hopefully someone will do a fan edit and cut out over an hour of weird camera angles and the sound of old cartoons playing in the distance because my god there's only so much I could handle...",2023-01-07

Or better yet, playing The Sims. The demon removes doors from where they were, trapping the kids in rooms, removes their toilet, sticks their toys on the ceiling where they can't reach them.

"But I did not.Yes, Kyle Edward Ball's audaciously odd directorial debut is about 25-30 minutes too long, edited in such a way that too many shots overstay their welcome.Yes, it is filmed in a manner to seemingly intentionally test an audience's patience with still shots that hide the characters' faces and set aside narrative momentum in favor of metaphorical experimentation.This will bother, and clearly has bothered, a lot of people. And I get it. It's not what they wanted. No hard feelings to these people. But now I want to talk about why I loved this film.I was absolutely gripped by Skinamarink. I found so much depth and meaning to come from its bare-bones visual and aural presentation.It's so, so ambiguous. But that didn't bother me because rather than showing bizarre imagery for the sake of it like so many experimental films, Ball instead keeps a GREAT deal of unknown in each frame.The creaky, eerie sound complimented the ever-shifting static of the cinematography to make my brain play all kinds of tricks on me. A handful of horrifying disturbing images make an appearance throughout the film, but the constant wondering of ""what was that sound"" or ""did I see something move in the frame"" made me just as on edge throughout.Though short on plot, I still found surprising thematic/character depth in each of the movie's unsettling, eerie frames of a single house.We don't get to know much about Kevin and Kaylee, but we know what kind of relationship they have as young siblings from the film's opening scenes, and it is so soul-crushing to see what happens and doesn't happen to them over the story's nightmarish happenings.As these kids are stalked in their house by something unknown and unseen, the horrifying things we see and hear are so clearly indicative of common childhood fears, traumas, and challenges: divorce, nightmares, abandonment, neglect, death, and a lack of control over your own choices.Seeing them play out on screen in such an uncanny way was so sad and so terrifying. The film's lack of a musical score, lack of concrete answers, piercing sound design, and ability to turn the intimacies of childhood into faceless, unknowable antagonists all made this one of the scariest movies I have ever seen.",2023-01-20
"I saw this film at the recommendation of a friends husband who said he couldn't sleep because he found the film so disturbing. Luckily a theatre near me was playing it so I got my brother to join, and we're mad.First of all the grainy film texture made me motion sick, second of all none of the scares paid off. It was like good set up and just nothing.It was also too dark, you couldn't see anything.Too quiet and too loud. All the dialogue is whispered and only sometimes captioned so I couldn't make out what characters where saying half the time.And omg was it too long. I think we thought it ended at least 8 times and just groaned when the movie kept going.",2023-01-22
"Now, I know that this movie technically released in 2022, but didn't come to theaters until 2023. In the second week of January, Skinamarink hits theaters, and is the worst movie of 2023.It played on Friday the 13th, no less. In the same theater I saw this, Friday the 13th part 6 was playing 2 hours later. Figuring that F13 was a later movie, and I'd seen it numerous times, why not check out a new movie?I figured wrong.This is definitely the worst movie I've sat through in my entire life...and that's even after sitting through Pet Sematary 2019, and Halloween Ends.This movie was filmed like a child was trying out his dad's camcorder and didn't properly know how to use it. As if he held the camera in one place, and moved his head instead of the camera, thinking he was recording what his own eyes see.There was no storyline. There was no acting. There were barely any faces. There were about 5 unnecessary jump scares, as in, nothing at all was happening when there was just a jump scare for the sake of calling it a horror movie.I don't think I ever walked out at the end of a movie where the audience was in complete silence trying to have this abomination that passes as cinema sink in. I also don't think I finished a movie and had been as angry as I was to have wasted my time actually going to a theater in hopes of actually seeing a scary movie.Just watch the trailer over and over and it will basically have the same effect as the actual movie. The trailer, though intriguing, and leaves you with a desire to see it just to know what it's about, is exactly what the movie's about...nothing.",2023-01-19
"Like I said in the review title, if you're like me, you're 15-20 minutes into the movie, and you're wondering if 1) you should turn it off, and 2) if anything ever happens. So you're checking IMBD reviews. My answers to those questions are 1) maybe, and 2) kind of. About 45 minutes in, there is a scene that is legitimately scary. Past that, there are a few scenes that are scary as well, but more than scary, the movie is just creepy and disturbing. You can feel reassured that yes, it does ratchet up in intensity.If you like movies that are ""abstract"" or ""artistic"", where there are many interpretations, and simultaneously they're all correct, yet also none of them are correct, then you should finish the movie. If that doesn't sound interesting, and you prefer movies that provide clear answers, then turn it off.This movie is not overly concerned about plot, though there are hints of plot in it. It is more concerned with style, and creating a specific dream/nightmare-like feeling.I would say it is quite effective at accomplishing that, though I ultimately found the movie somewhat unsatisfying. The plot summaries about children in a house with disappearing doors and a monster sounds like the book ""House of Leaves"", which I loved. But there isn't nearly as much plot as in ""House of Leaves"". You barely see any characters, you barely understand any plot.I can't say that I liked it, though ultimately I think it was a ""good movie"".The reason I ultimately gave this movie a somewhat positive review is because it gave me something to think about. I read some articles and posts about it afterwards. I read two different articles like ""Skinamarink Ending Explained"", and they both provided very different summaries of the events that happened in the movie, let alone the ending. The movie is very open to interpretation, and I liked that aspect. There were a few scenes and images that are hard to forget. But the movie is also too long and repetitive and boring a lot of the time. I appreciate the movie, and what the creators were trying to accomplish, and I'll be curious to see what the director can do with more than $15,000.",2023-02-10
"What can I say that hasn't already been said in the other reviews?Plot is thin. Two kids wake to discover their father is gone and there are no windows or doors to the outside. Also, the toilet is missing. And there's... something... in there with them. That's about all you get. The rest is up to the four year old kid in you.Something about this film invoked a sense of dread in me that I haven't felt in 40 years. It wasn't the thing lurking in the dark that spoke to the children, though. It was the dark itself. It was the unlit corners. It was the absence of the comfort of a parent. It was the strange glow of the TV in a dark room when your unsure of your surroundings. It was that door you left open just a crack.I'm not sure what to think of this film, honestly. It's not for everyone. It may not have been for me. I'm not sure yet. But I have to hand it to the director for scaring the hell out of me.",2022-11-24
"Honestly, I have no idea how will I reach the required limit of characters. Snoozefest from first to last second. It's BEYOND BORING. Take the most boring film you've ever seen, multiply by 1000 - and boom, you have Skinamarink.There's nothing in this movie, if you can even call it that, worth watching. I tuned out after the first 20 mins and endured the pain since I never turn off movies. It was so unbearable. Boring, boring, boring.. If this scares you then I have no idea. You must've never watched any horror.It has one half decent jump scare to be honest, it almost gave me a heart attack, not because it was scary but because I mentally tuned out entirely so it caught me by surprise.Negative 100 out of 10.",2023-01-27
"At first I was enjoying this movie. I expected it to be scary. It wasn't really and eventually it got boring. Just when I had my fill there was still like way to much of the movie left. It has no business being this long. Most of the scenes in this film are highly irrelevant. They're just filler for atmosphere. Although the atmosphere presented was intense it over stayed its welcome. I don't regret watching this movie but I would not recommend it and will never watch it again. It did however make me feel like the concept might be nice to see if better executed in a shorter movie. If you chose to watch this movie. Just know the entire movie is just how the beginning is. You never really see any actors at all. Just empty rooms with voices. Specifically the children in question. It does not flesh out into anything bigger at all. If you do not feel the movie 30 minutes in, don't expect it to change. It will not.",2023-01-22
"My hometown isn't exactly known for great movies being produced there, nevermind having great film-makers, so I was hoping that this film would at least break that curse due to the traction that it has been getting.I must also add some positives here and add congrats to the film-maker for completing their project. Making a movie is no small task, on any budget.Sadly that's where the positives begin and end. I've never in my life seen something so boring, I think I've enjoyed watching paint dry more. The shots are lifeless, the sound is horrendous, and my god what in the heck was that final shot?This is a new low in filmmaking. It had nothing redeeming about it, even the most bad films have something you can get out of it but this is just some half assed b.s. Labelled as artsy.If someone could break the curse of terrible filmmaking from my city that would be great, unfortunately that is not the case with Skinamarink.Stay away, stay far away!",2023-01-08
"Let me try to break this down for you;1. Do you like weird camera angles that focus on the tops of doorways and only show people from their ankles down?2. Do you like movies that are so dark, you can barely tell what's going on?3. Do you like movies where people whisper, so you absolutely need to watch the movie with subtitles?4. Do you like jump scares that are ruined because they're too dark to see?5. Do you like movies where the story takes a back seat to experimental nonsense?If you shook your head no to any of the questions above, guess what? You will absolutely hate this movie like I did. Never in my life have I see a movie that was equal parts annoying as it was mundane. I fell asleep watching it not once, not twice, but 5 whole times, and for a movie like this with a runtime of almost 2 hours, you'll understand why it was so many. This wasn't a movie in the pure sense of the word. This was the type of movie shown for free and labeled as ""transgressive art"" in a modern art museum. It wasn't entertaining, it was horribly and cheaply made, and will only leave a lasting impression on children and those with child-like IQ's.I should have know this was going to be trash because TIkTok couldn't stop talking about it. The people on that app have the absolutely worst taste on everything, and this movie was the absolute bottom of the barrel. I will never get my 2 hours back, but I'll be damned if I'm going to let anyone else make the same mistake.DO NOT WATCH THIS ""MOVIE"". Its terrible in every conceivable way.",2022-12-03
"The people that praise this movie are either the people who made this trash or high. This movies was over an hour of bad camera shots of the walls, ceiling, table lamps, and floor.It's like a couple kids tried to do a Blair Witch style movie and forgot to make it scary.I cannot fathom how people found this scary. Seeing Grandma naked is way more scary than this snore fest.I read the reviews first, then watched and waited, with baited breath, for something scary. Like hoping to win the mega ball or that million dollar scratch ticket, I was sorely disappointed. If you find this scary, sleep with the lights on, don't go outside, ever, and never, ever interact with another human being. I've been more scared of Pokeman cartoons than this movie. Seriously, the scariest part were the legos on the floor, because stepping on those are horrible. This is not a horror movie, it's just horrible.",2022-12-15
"I lasted a little less than an hour before I couldn't take any more of this complete travesty of a cow pie and turned it off. There are ads currently hyping this film to prepare it for a theatrical release (and if this can find a distributor, anything can), and once audiences realize they've been totally had, it will die the quiet death it deserves. Basically the ""plot"" consists of watching two kids monotonously crawl around an empty house in the dark, with the same group of point-of-view shots endlessly repeated over and over again. There is nothing ""creepy"" or ""horrifying"" about it whatsoever... it's just appallingly empty and pretentious. The film has a running time of 100 minutes, but it appears the filmmaker shot only about 15 or 20 of actual footage and just repeated most of the same shots over and over again during the editing process, ad nauseum. I'm a huge fan of independent and experimental horror films, but this load of excrement doesn't even come close to even fitting that genre, it just insults the intelligence. The reviews here claiming it's frightening have got to be either planted, or if they're not, written by people who must have a scare quotient of -10. The film has been making the rounds on the internet for some time now, and all I can say is I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it - it's seriously not worth the admission price of a dollar. The budget was reportedly $15,000.00... it seriously looks like it was made for less than $25.00. You've been warned.",2023-01-13
"I just watched it, and I dug it. In many respects it reminded of the book House Of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski. A book that has a similar theme of a house that has rooms that constantly change, people disappear etc. And as someone that has grown up watching experimental films, as well as listening to and making experimental music, I thought the pace of the film was just right.The power of suggestion is always a good thing, and the fact that there was little footage of actual people present here works well. It added to the sense of isolation in the house. The whispering too was a nice touch. The children sensed there was something there.I also found the atmosphere throughout kind of relaxing. Maybe I'm just used now, to dark things.",2023-02-09
"""Skinamarink"" is undoubtedly one of the most unique viewing experiences in my existing memory, and it's rather challenging for me to truly pinpoint my own reaction and opinion of it. Depending on your taste, it can be equal parts a liminal horror masterpiece and a true tedium. I know one thing to be true, it requires absolute attention and maximum immersion to get out of it all that director Kyle Edward Ball intended to do to you.Two little children, 5 year old Kaylee and her 4 years old brother Kevin, wake up in the middle of the night to find their father is missing, and all the windows and doors in their home have vanished. Definitely sounds like a concept to bring a lot of creeps. And so it does. ""Skinamarink"" starts out with the slowest pacing I've ever experienced, and during the first 20-30 minutes one might feel the temptation to give up on this film. The entire cinematography, the sum of the 100 minute runtime consists almost exclusively of obscure shots of just about everything in the (director's childhood) house, except people. You practically don't see character's faces at all, only legs. Ceiling. Walls. Furniture. Darkness, a lot of darkness, holding within itself the dreadful sense than anything can come into your eyes and mind at any given time. The screen is full of grain and 70's-like screen scratches, the depthless dark keeps morphing, and the sense of dread is creeping-crawling around every corner of every frame. You know that weird, scary pile of clothes in your room in the middle of the night? This is that: the movie. It's an absolute trump move to put such youngins as main characters, the rebirth of your most primal childhood fears is what Kyle Edward Ball wants to offer you. Most people seek the kind of comfort an ignorant bliss they had as young children, but director of ""Skinamarink"" serves just the opposite of that spectrum.It's a liminal, esoteric, ambient, analogue, lo-fi horror if I've ever seen one. And made with palpable, impressive confidence. Slowly, very slowly, but surely, ""Skinamarink"" lulls one into the deep sense of unease, hiding short, momentary glimpses of absolute terror inbetween long periods of almost sheer ambient nothingness. It's a movie that rewards the patient. Ball gives us a playground in which our imagination will do more work than the movie itself, and that's not a negative critique, but quite the feat.""Skinamarink"" creates a tiny yet massive world, from which there is no escape. Days after seeing it, I'm still trying to grasp what I saw, and on what scale I enjoyed it. This film has gotten the kind of buzz no art can buy, and rightly so, I believe it will be remembered as cult film, perhaps even as a revolutionary kind of horror. My rating: 7/10.",2023-01-14
"I'm pretty sure I understand what the director is trying to do, and believe it or not, I respect him for it. A lot of the time, I was, indeed, thinking of my childhood nightmares and irrational fears, like many others have said they did. But it didn't scare me. Despite all the hype on Reddit and going in without expectations, it just didn't do much of anything for me.I think it's partly because I KNOW those fears are irrational and I just can't put myself in the mindset of my inner child anymore, not to mention I'm well-attuned to the dark side of things, so it doesn't feel as threatening now. Another reason is because the ""scary"" moments in the movie are relegated to a few small jumpscares, and some moments where you THINK something bad is about to happen, but without the payoff. Lastly, I don't think the ultra-minimalistic approach is for me. While the unknown can definitely be scary when done right, I require identifiable traits to characters beyond just voices and footsteps to feel anything for them.There's definitely parts that made me slightly unnerved, such as the disembodied voice - an entity or possibly the darkness itself - instructing one of the children to put a knife in their eye, with the sound of a child crying shortly afterwards. Unfortunately, the movie's too long for its own good. I watched it pretty late at night when I was tired and winding down, so that might have had something to do with me being less than impressed.Like I said, I respect the director's effort. He's clearly trying to make minimalism scary, and assuming that he's not astroturfing it (I will say I'm a little suspicious that the movie started out with something over 4 stars only to get a 5.5 in like a week after I last checked), he seems to have succeeded with at least a few, and I genuinely admire that. I just don't think his style is for me. I checked out some of his short films, including Heck, which is sort of a prototype for Skinamarink, but didn't feel any actual dread. I still feel bad about checking it out early instead of waiting for a mass release in the US, so I'm willing to give it another try so that Kyle at least gets his money's worth from me watching it.",2022-12-21
"I did not dislike this movie. It was more or less exactly what I expected. As a fan of the creepy aesthetic of David Lynch and movies that challenge the audience I wasn't too disappointed. I love the concept and appreciate the approach but ultimately if you are going to ask an audience for 90-120 minutes of their time I think a film should give them more than Skinamarink delivers. Still, from a first time filmmaker it's an admirable effort.I far prefer slow burning horror films that play to the fear of the unknown and an have an underlying sense of dread (The Witch, Hereditary, and The Blair Witch Project are personal faves). Skinamarink tries to play in this arena but doesn't effectively use any cinematic tools to build tension or make the viewer anxious. No soundtrack, very little camera movement, and not enough dynamic use of light and shadow. All things that I think probably could have been achieved, even with a miniscule budget. Thematically it starts in a very minable vein but then doesn't actually develop what amounts to a fairly universal experience of fear (i.e. Being a defenseless child abandoned by caregivers). We feel isolated and alone with the children but are distanced from the sense that anything frightening is happening I think because so little of the film takes place from the children's perspective. It did get me thinking about how to make a horror movie driven by fear of the unknown. If you want to make something universally scary how much do you need to show the audience to prime them to be afraid and how much can you leave to their imaginations? In the end Skinamarink asks the individual viewer to fill in too many blanks for it to be an effective horror movie in my opinion. Truly neurotic people will probably find it unnerving and anxiety inducing but aside from a couple of cheap jump scares nothing particularly interesting happens. My impression was that the vast majority of people will most likely find the movie a waste of time and for that reason I cannot recommend it. But if you like a challenge, are home alone on a stormy night, and/or are capable of letting your imagination run wild then, sure, give it a shot.",2023-01-18
"To understand the boredom of this film, watch the trailer and add that up to what is on the screen for 1 hour and 40 minutes. Or just watch the trailer over 100 times in a row, and that's what plays out on screen for the entire duration of the film.I didn't reach the end. I couldn't endure any more of some camcorder type picture of close ups of an entire house of different types of furniture. What on earth made anyone think that 105 minutes of furniture close ups would make a great feature film?As someone else said on here, this would of been an okay short 15 minute film. It really is identical to the trailer, except the trailer ends after 2 minutes. How this ended up in an article recently, that this was the best horror film in years, I do not know. Other than the filmmakers paid someone to write that article.",2023-02-05
"You've probably heard that Kyle Edward Ball's ""Skinamarink"" is an experimental horror movie. Trust me, it's VERY experimental. Taking place entirely inside a house, there are only a few shots of people. It's mostly dialogue over shots of objects. If the goal is to try out something new, then they succeeded brilliantly. Otherwise, it's the sort of movie that tests your attention span. You might end up only paying attention during the scenes where the tykes watch cartoons (including one featuring the Bugs Bunny prototype).At the very least, the movie deserves points for not relying on CGI, jump scares, or the countless cliches found in most horror flicks (the stars are children, so I guess that they couldn't have these cliches). An interesting watch if you have nothing better to do.So that's what's up, doc.",2023-09-19
"I had been keen to see this film after reading all the online reviews in horror forums and seeing all the love and absolute hate this films gets
So I hunkered in on my day off and prepares to have my mind blown.....
I tried so hard to find something redeeming in this film and I sat through the entire thing just waiting for something, anything to happen.....but something never came and nothing ever happened
What an absolutely steaming pile of pretentious, deliberately obscure, grainy, dark garbage
If I didnt have subtitles on my TV telling me what the random noises were in the completely dark film,I would have no idea what was going on.And if you have to Google a films plot just to know what you just saw,odds are its a big fat piece of crudTheres no plot,no story ,no reasons, no bad guy, no motive,

"One of, if not the most unconventional horrors I have ever confronted, and it was precisely this unconventionality that drew me to it in the first place, and it necessitates no explanation that it grew on me over time.Now I can understand if it does not appeal at all to someone, and I can also see why this film may not sit well with the vast majority of the audience, as it contains numerous elements that could be off-putting. For example, the film's visual aesthetics consist primarily of a timeline of grainy, noise-filled imageries, as if they were processed with an Instagram filter.They did have the desired effect on me though; at first I was sceptical, but I eventually became captivated. Not only was I completely absorbed in it, I was also terrified of all the bizarre events that followed thencefoth.A scintillating sound design with a perceptible ASMR vibe further amplified my experience, and I found myself in a genuinely terrifying situation where I could not predict what was going to happen next, which I believe made it more disconcerting, more frightful.",2023-01-09
"Despite all of the negative reviews I decided to give this movie a shot. The movie Paranormal Activity got a lot of bad reviews too but I enjoyed it because rather than seeing it in a movie theater with an audience I watched it alone and late at night in an apartment that I had just moved into. I thought that maybe Skinamarink might benefit from a similar setting. It didn't. Watching it alone and in the dark simply resulted in my falling asleep about 30 minutes in. I tried watching the rest of the movie the next day in the afternoon and started nodding off again. Other reviews have already described the film's premise and the means by which the filmmaker goes about telling the story so I won't bother with all that here except to say that the constant jump cuts from one static shot to another never conveyed to me the impression that I was following two children wandering around a dark, creepy house trying to find their parents, unless the two kids were teleporting from room to room every several seconds and then just standing in one spot looking at random stuff. There was simply no narrative or visual flow. Nothing about this movie engaged me, even in a dark, late-night setting. It was just boring and irritating. Frankly it felt a bit like I was being punked or trolled. Big NO on this one.",2023-09-03
"I can understand why this crap had a budget of 15K Canadian $. Its utter trash. You cant see anything But distorted pictures and voices and some old Cartoon running on a television. Its not scary, entertaining to watch. Its depressing and weird. You never understand whats going on or how it became like it did. There is no explanation or anything. If they wanted to make a weird and depressing movie without any acting and with everything distorted, they succeded. This movie is utter and very cheap trash. And it tries to be something Its not. Its just depressing and weird and boring. And you have wasted your time at best, and gotten depressed at worst.",2022-12-19
"It seems like it either triggers some dark childhood fear of the dark & you'll find it terrifying or it will be 140 mins of expectation without much payoff. I'm in the latter category. It has the Lynch vibe some of his movies have where it's like a dream/nightmare & either you're down for the ride or not. If not, it's a brutally boring experience. I just wasn't given enough context to be scared. Most of the time I not only had no idea who was talking or whose POV is being presented, but I couldn't understand 70% of the (very minimal) dialogue. I caught most of what was subtitled. I assume there's a reason for the random subtitles, but I'm not smart enough to understand the point of intentionally letting the indecipherable mumbles/grunts/whispers fly. A couple of scenes and some of the ambient sounds added to the overall creepy vibe, but ultimately just didn't instill any sense of dread, fear, or interest. It wasn't a dream/nightmare or a narrative of childhood primal fear of the unknown, it was just a series of poorly lit set shots & ambiguous mumbles. It seems like it would be more effective as a 15 or 20 minute short.",2022-11-27
"It's 1995. Two kids wake up at night to find their dad missing. They are alone in the house and that house is changing. Doors, windows, and even the toilet go missing. The kids are stuck in their home in a surreal nightmare.This is a micro budget experimental Canadian indie horror. It has one interesting idea derived from its no-budget 'special effect' of disappearing the house. What it needs next is the kids to do some big time acting. For too much of the film, they are off-screen doing dialogue that can barely be heard and only seen in the subtitle on the screen. This is a student short pretending to be a theatrical film. While I appreciate some of the ideas and themes within the work, the overall effect is to wait and wait. It's hard to feel for the kids when they are barely on the screen. It's hard to understand the house or the situation. It's basically an interesting nightmare at first, but it just keeps going and going. At some point, it needs to do something more than what it is already doing.",2023-07-28
"Skinamarink is a micro-budget horror film made by Canadian filmmaker Kyle Edward Ball. The film is a chamber piece, taking place entirely inside of an ordinary house which is suddenly missing doors and windows. The film contains almost no dialogue nor nearly any effects. There is a digital, cheap-looking grain effect superimposed on the entire film, mimicking a 70s era camera.Most of the film is quiet, except for a television displaying black and white cartoons in the public domain, and the shrill sounds of Legos being dumped and moved about. Skinamarink was made for under $25,000, has a barebones plot, only five total characters, and a wafer-thin story which must be researched online to truly grasp. It is also the scariest film I have ever seen and has tortured me psychologically for well over a month.The film follows two children, Kevin and Kaylee, who awake one night to discover their father has vanished, along with every door and window in their house. During the course of the night - which may or may not actually be an eternity - the pair begin to sense the presence of a nameless, shapeless entity who exists only to watch them suffer.Skinamarink is fundamentally divisive. The online discourse surrounding the film is split neatly into ratings of 1s and 10s; the 1s have a slight majority but both sides are each passionate about their opinions of the film and utterly confused and/or dismayed by those who think differently. The discourse - all of the love, hatred, confusion, and polarity - make sense considering the technique and circumstances of Skinarmarink's creation.Again, the film is essentially plotless, basically requires external material for deeper readings, and is, in every sense, extremely minimal. Its pacing is glacial and its chamber drama construction bears no opportunity for variety of place, time, or dynamic narrative structure. Therefore, those not in tune with its superior sense of atmosphere, those who simply aren't instilled with the sense of dread the film is capable of conjuring, will have nothing to grab hold to at almost any point.Discussing, analyzing, and hypothesizing on why some don't buy into the film's power is interesting, and will be explored later, but both sides must understand a fundamental truth: the feelings of either dread or boredom the film creates at any one moment will be replicated in all remaining moments. In other words, Skinamarink is a cinematic monolith; what you see when you first gaze in is all there is. Nothing more, nothing less.If the film doesn't work for you, it doesn't work for you...however, if you are in tune with Skinarmarink's unique sense of primordial darkness, prepare for a viewing experience of psychological unease and childlike helplessness. Allow me to indulge in removing my critical objectivity and third-person presentation to describe my incredible fright.Films often have no effect on me. This is true of every genre but it's particularly true of horror, which I often find boring, uncreative, and repetitive, despite my love for the potential of the genre to challenge and excite. Before Skinamarink, the only film to make me hold onto my fear after the credits was Hereditary, which took only an extra day or two to process and recover from.It has now been one month since I saw Skinamarink on the big screen; when darkness falls and the house grows silent, when I prepare for sleep or am simply trying to quietly reflect, I am still burdened and unsettled by the feelings I experienced while watching the film. The agony started in the theater, as I buried my head into my hands, barely peeking through to see nothing but static on slivers of the screen. I missed about half of the movie in this state, debating with myself on whether to stay or leave, frequently wanting to walk out but too frightened to move.The type, intensity, and presence of fear I felt in the theater was that of when I was just a scared little boy, shaking and quivering through trailers for films my prepubescent mind found thoroughly unpleasant. That feeling has lessened in the last month but has not entirely dissipated. Skinamarink, to my nonfictional, entirely real horror, has reignited a fear of the dark I had long since forgotten, and has left me in the trembling, contemplative state of my youth. Uniquely personal visions of horror have started to intrude, and my psyche is desperate to close a box which has long been sealed, but which this damned film has reopened.If I could sum up my thoughts on the film in five words, before slipping back on my veil of objectivity: Skinamarink is way too effective.Perhaps the most interesting element of the film is the audience split, the love and hate. Why are some so entranced and affected when others are bored to tears? The first and most simple theory is setting of viewership. The film was leaked after a festival (intentionally, some speculate) leading to rampant piracy. Those who watch Skinarmarink on a laptop, with headphones in, are unequivocally missing the full experience. Most notably, the imagined figures in the dark static and immaculate sound design could both be misconstrued on a smaller screen. If one even hopes to find the fear in the film, a theater is mandatory.Alternatively, Skinamarink may frighten those who have personally lived through its setting and emulations. More than just a feeling or question of nostalgia, Skinarmarink's fear is a child's fear, a fear of the unknown, an ambiguous fear most likely felt by acolytes in their own lives, when they were children. I theorize that the tone, implications, and psychological impact of the film is most deeply felt in those able to directly visualize themselves within the film, next to Kevin and Kaylee, scared and alone in a dark house with nothing but a television and a set of Legos to distract from the horrors of the house and the world.Viewers who stayed up late at night against their parents' wishes, who had no company but blurry media and some simple toys in a slumbering house, maybe those who were generally anxious or unnerved throughout their childhood, even those with more extreme or rare trauma, will most intensely respond to Skinamarink. To sit through the movie is to sit through those memories, and the fears they create, again.The film's emulation of the period is not just neutrally presented, but shockingly precise and accurate. Every element is meticulously tuned for maximum fear and discomfort: there's little sound throughout (the stark sound of rustling, crashing Legos most frequently keeps me awake at night) there is no adult presence to comfort characters or the audience, there is no logical rhyme or rhythm to the editing - causing shots to linger agonizingly long on ambiguous minutia - there is no human presence outside the house, there is little light from within, and there is no explanation or exposition as to the why or how of it all. The viewer is utterly alone with the children throughout, hoping for relief, praying for release.Skinamarink can be summarized, ironically enough, with a quote from beloved comedy The Office. As the group watches a film made by Gabe, he senses confusion and tension about the lack of story, and chimes in: ""Yeah, seems like there isn't a narrative. Maybe the filmmaker realized that even narrative is comforting."" Most know, in some sense, that narrative is indeed comforting. But I never knew just how comforting it was until it was gone.",2023-02-13
"If you like looking at boring shots of the tops of doorways, T. V. screens, and kids toys for 100 minutes, this movie is for you! It's incredibly dull. It also ends in a very unsatisfying conclusion. Now, I don't mind ambiguous endings at all, but after the long, bloated time it took to get there, it was not worth it. Only reason I gave this more than one star was because there is a very effective scene involving one of the children in his parents' room, but that's about it. I feel like the director is just throwing stuff at the wall to see what would stick (wink, wink). Go watch the trailer and imagine watching it over and over again for over an hour and a half. That's the movie.",2022-12-31
".....to people I hate, and I don't hate anyone! Let's have a go at dissecting some of the higher rated ""reviews"". There are a good few that mention A24 picking up on this. Yep, they're on crack. One review says ""It's what it was like waking up when they were in the late 90s early 2000s"" What??! What kind of a s#+y upbringing did you have?! I don't understand why there are reviews saying there is spoilers in this as at 13 minutes you see feet. Around 30 mins you see a toilet appear then disappear. At 58 mins you see a face.That's it!I'm doing the director a huge favour in not even giving this a rating. I'm not the hardest critic on movies by any stretch. Just look at my reviews on certain ""terrible"" movies and you'll see I always try to put at least a good spin on some quite badly rated films but this took the piss.If I recommended this move to any friends I would expect a serious phone call straight after asking what I'd ever done to them.I see this was Crowdfunded as well....sorry folks. I don't know why I'm apologising, but someone should. The ending is just an unclearer picture of the grisly finding on the mobile phone in the mockumentary Lake Mungo.An absolutely shocking attempt at a movie. If this was an art project the film maker must have been pretty embarrassed when handing this in.So, all in all, if I had to say how I felt about this piece of garbage I'd say: if I had done something terrible and was given the death penalty or to watch this, just ONCE a day for the rest of my life, I'd say ""bring on the steak, medium rare, thanks. I'm outta here"".",2022-12-27
"How the ef did this get made?!!! Seriously?! Who would give any money toward actually producing this garbage?! Wow! Just, wow.There is literally NOTHING to see in this movie. The director chose to just film shots of the house on grainy 60's style footage- including debris popping up on screen; filming- ceiling, walls, toilet, and especially the floor with toys on it. It's all noise, shots of the house and no humans. Okay well you can see a few seconds of a girl sitting on a bed and a very grainy, blurry face at the end. But the whole film is just shots of the house, some noise and barely any dialogue. It's boring grainy garbage. Nothing happens, there's nothing to see, I kid you not, just NOTHING!. How is it possible to get a film made that is just pov of a toddler walking through a house, filming random shots of the inside of his house on an old film camera from the 60s?! Well if you wonder what that would look like, wonder no more- it has been made in Skinamarink.Non-opinion forming sheep will say this movie is ""so cool, you just don't get it"" to go along with pretentious influencers and critics, but it's really just the worst film ever get made.",2023-03-24
"There's an amusing tweet that describes the two kinds of Letterboxd review one might find for Skinamarink. On one hand is a reviewer that gave it five stars, praising it as ""surreal and familiar in the same stroke; liminal horror existing at the crossroads of comfortable, mundane surroundings and everything we can imagine might be in the darkness on the other side"". Another asked why a bunch of grown adults are sobbing over 100 minutes of dim shots of ceiling corners.Yeah, it seems that this remarkable indie horror film -- which leaked a few months ago and went viral for its uniquely nightmarish presentation, and is now available to watch ""officially"" -- is either going to bore you to tears or tap into a sort of fear you haven't felt since you were small and helpless (or, at the very least, smaller and more helpless than most every adult human feels). The effect of Skinamarink, a film wholly devoted to the ""less is more"" principle, is meant to be that of the nightmares we had long ago -- or the special kind of terror and confusion we felt in the seconds after waking up.It's meant to be a type of horror that we haven't seen yet -- a movie that reminds us of the dread we all feel at the idea of being unsafe, maybe even trapped, in our own sanctuaries; at the proverbial ""things that go bump in the night"". The hype around it suggests the same fascination that previous generations felt toward The Blair Witch Project in 1999 (though there aren't any rumors, at least that I've seen, that the footage of Skinamarink might be real).In a similar vein, however: remember how some people felt that Blair Witch was just a bunch of shaky shots of trees? Yeah. Indeed history repeats itself.Critic David Ehrlich summarized the film's minimal plot best, describing ""a creepypasta remake of Home Alone, steeped in the ineffable fear a young child would feel if the rest of their family abandoned them in the middle of the night"" and also comparing it to Paranormal Activity without the jump scares and filmed from the ""POV"" of the house itself. (Jump scares are rarely scary by themselves, but the anticipation/build-up toward them, telegraphing that something could pounce at any second, can be quite effective -- Skinamarink endeavors to maintain that anxiety throughout.) From the way this film affected me personally, I would also compare it to the unsurpassed 2000 novel House of Leaves (not just because of the ever-warping reality and ""liminal space"" rules of its setting).And yes, the film did affect me -- and I'm prepared to admit that it might have to do with the headspace I was in the day I saw it, which I'd rather not elaborate on too much. Let's just say that the lost, frightened child that still lives somewhere within me was easier to summon than usual.Regardless, there are some technical aspects I wish to praise as well. I've read that the film was shot digitally, but the images have been expertly mastered to look like something from the 1970s. I'm aware that writer-director Kyle Edward Ball has cited the works of Brakhage and Lynch, but also ""analog horror"" -- that relative of found footage horror that's mainly seen on the Internet, usually concerns uncovered video tapes or film reels (filled with content that wasn't meant to be released or even seen), and often involves some kind of Alternate Reality Game for the viewers to participate in.This leads me to believe that, as much as I admire Skinamarink, it really might've worked better as an analog horror short film on YouTube. In fact, while writing this, I discovered via a mutual on Twitter that Skinamarink is based on a short film that spun from Ball's Bitesized Nightmares channel. It's Lights Out all over again.Of course, I don't mean to say that it's impossible to do this style for 90+ minutes (Hell, I'd be impressed by its sheer ballsiness if it pulled a Warhol and played for 7 hours). I just feel like there are scenes where the director didn't quite know what to put there, but knew he had to crack a certain runtime somehow. Even though, as I said, Skinamarink stuck with me in a considerable way, I got bored a few times during the viewing as such. I don't know. It's possible that this is all my own fault. Either it should've been an analog horror series on YouTube, or I shouldn't have watched too much Gemini Home Entertainment before seeing this movie.For now, I give the movie a 3.5/5. I'm not sure just how much I love it, but I unquestionably appreciate it; doubly do I appreciate that something so distinct gets to be so widespread and talked about -- due to the fascinating fact that, for all the unique things about this film, it somehow recalls a vague memory that we all seem to share.",2023-01-16
"I'll start this with I'm not usually a horror fan, the medium is usually saturated with cheap jump scares and action movies dressed up with a scary antagonist.Skinamarink is the most primal fear I've ever experienced on screen. It's odd angles and poor resolution create a dream-like sensation while avoiding faces and full characters in frame deprive you of comfort or connection. It's slow pace brings a feeling of imprisonment to what is playing out in the house.This film feeds off the unknown, taking you back to a time where you couldn't explain the noises in the ceiling or what might be lurking in the dark corners of a room. It's a masterpiece of visual story telling, each hovering shot or anomalous event is carefully placed to explain what very little the movie offers for a story. The rules this entity has established. It digs into the oldest programming of your mind, the code that allowed you to learn as a child, and uses it to write a new language it speaks with.I dare not sat too much, but the negative reviews here seem to be influenced by being surrounded in a theater. This move preys on the feelings of isolation, I watched it on a leaked source and it hit hard, real hard. Just discussing it again with my friends and writing this review chills my spine, reliving the small details that make it the terror it is.",2022-11-01
"I like unique movies and I like slow burn horrors. This is the most amateurish movie I've seen since the The Blair Witch Project....which was good. I like low budget and creative movies but this was so f@ckin boring that I only made to 1 hour. I read the reviews and it was split evenly between genius and absolute sh@T. I'm willing to give any movie a chance but this movie feels like if I got my kids to speak lines, that I could've made this movie. It's so amateurish that it is just so boring. I made it an hour and 5 minutes through so, admittedly, I might've missed the big reveal. I dont give a sh@T cuz I shouldn't have to wait 1 or more hours for a movie to get interesting. If you actually read this whole thing, watch like 30 minutes and tell me I'm lying. I appreciate new takes on the genre but this ain't it!",2023-01-14
"Not even fun to watch because it's so bad bad, just genuinely unenjoyable.It relies heavily on bad camera angles and a broken microphone, I honestly would love to see somebody remake this movie shot for shot but with normal camera angles. The focus is never on what is actually active in the scene, which comes across as a cheap gimmick.The silence cut by poorly recorded noises and static on screen might be meant to elicit dread or tension, but I never felt anything other than boredom. It kind of reminds me of the first Paranormal Activity movie, but without all of the moments that were fun to make fun of.Over reliance on jump scares is a giveaway that a movie isn't scary. I guess the four or five we got weren't that bad, but all of them felt dirt cheap. I'm sure somebody out there will edit this down to five or ten minutes, you're better off waiting for that version this was a huge waste of time.PS: The orange LEGO brick remover is an anachronism, brick removers were gray in the 90s.",2023-01-15
"I can usually find SOMETHING I like about a film. But there is nothing I liked a out this. It's nothing but a series of shots of ceilings and walls and the occasional toy. There are a few lines of ""dialogue"" from horrible child actors and the occasional creepy voice. But nothing happens. Nothing happens at all for an hour and 40 minutes. When you think something might happen...it doesn't. Many people are saying this fed on primal childhood fear, but I found nothing about it to be remotely scary. I just found it annoying. I kept looking at my watch and signing hoping it would just end. There is no character development whatsoever, so there's nothing to care about. It's just walls and darkness with occasional weird things happening. I never thought I could hate a movie as much as I hate this. My biggest issue with so many films coming out is the fact that so many are filmed so dark that you can't see anything. This takes that trend and magnifies it. The majority of the audience walked out of the theater I was in. I wish I would have. I could lay in bed and stare at the corner of my ceiling in the dark and get more than I got out of this film.This reminded me very much of that video they have to watch in The Ring...but with less visuals and plot. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna die in 7 days.",2023-01-29
"I should have read the reviews (rather than just the IMDb score) before even attempting to watch this film, as even people who noticed ALL of it's flaws & call it out seem to be giving it around a 5 & this film really, REALLY does not deserve that. I know it is supposed to be artistic but honestly, it is just a grainy video of shots of a house, terribly fuzzy audio & next to no plot. I'm sure that it can be used for torture in some way it is THAT bad. It was grating my nerves after 10 mins (if you hold out past 10 minutes, you might think that it might pick up...no...it is pretty much the same all the way through). This isn't a film, this is a test of endurance to see if you can survive the boredom.",2023-02-05
"Look, I'm going to start off and say that a good chunk of this movie is boring. The boredom is almost as much of a character as the house itself, because that makes the scares that much stronger. In my twenty-five years, I have never seen something that's caused me to feel disturbed for days after, but this has succeeded in that.It's supposed to evoke childhood fears and make you feel vulnerable, and it more than nails that.I especially recommend it if you're a fan of analog YouTube horror such as Mandela Catalogue, because it has that strong feel to it, with a lot of shots of the house at awkward angles while your eyes strain to see through the shadows.",2023-01-25
"Two toddlers wake up in the middle of the night and their Dad is gone. The walk around the house saying ""dad."" The build a pillow fort, play with Legos and watch old cartoons on TV. And when we get board watching them do this from bad grainy camera angles and trashy sound, we get to watch it all over again. They manage a 911 call. It takes place in 1995 for some reason. I imagine this is an idea of Canadian Limbo. The film thanks everyone who helped crowd funded this film. Not worth watching for free. Sorry Joshua Bookhalter. I was bored.Guide: No swearing. Sex. Or nudity. Not much talking at all.",2023-07-25
"I am really upset this format does not offer the ZERO star review for this incredible trash. Nothing happens. Nothing!!! Eighty percent of the film is a dark room, empty hallway shots with a cheap, grainy not grindhouse filter distorting the screen and showing NOTHING. Fifteen percent is a annoying child voice whispering so quietly they actually have to put subtitles on the screen for the audience to even vaguely understand what is happening. Then five percent is mostly ineffective cheap jump scares. It's so stupid that it should of never made a 100 minute movie it should leave his short film ""heck"" one short film is good enough.",2023-06-30
"A nice and fresh take in the scene. Pretty unique.But I started to lose interest in about 10 minutes in.Don't get me wrong... the style is absolutely unsettling and omnious. But it's the same style throughout and that what's getting bored.Still shots that go on for too long, some inaudible voices, grainy scènes...all done in a good way, but it gets pretty boring. Too bad..
I really hoped this one got a new, fresh take on the genre. But it lacks. It keeps repeating itself until it gets boring or repetitive.I think the so called hype is only for the style of this new movie. But as mentioned, it's nothing more than that.It could've been better imo...",2023-01-17
"This is truly one of the spookiest things I have watched in recent years and perfectly captures the feeling of being trapped in a gut-wrenching nightmare. As enjoyable as the almost tangible dread may be it does seem to drag out at some parts....perhaps 10-20 minutes shorter and it would have been perfect.The filming style is very disorienting and meant to be enjoyed in the dark with minimal distractions. Voices are muffled, sometimes completely inaudible minus subtitles and characters are only partially shown. The sound is so peaked at times if there's any kind of sudden loud noise/jump scare it makes it 10 times more effective. Very much reminds me of the infamous puppet combo games.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a unique horror experience and/or if you're a fan of David Lynch's work.",2022-12-05
"A lot of people are split down the middle about this movie. Some people thought it was the scariest thing they've ever watched and others said it was pretentious.For me, this movie didn't make me feel terror, it made me feel uneasy, tense, and hollow. And honestly, that's way better.The story follows these two kids (one age four, the other I'm assuming is in the six or seven range) wake up to find their father missing, and all the outside doors and windows to their house are gone. They turn on the lights and the tv to keep themselves company, but the power slowly begins to fail them, and weird things start happening. There is something in the house with them, some unnamed entity that keeps beckoning the kids upstairs.The movie starts fairly slow, a lot of random, strangely framed shots of the house. The entire thing looks like it was filmed on an old VHS, making you feel even more isolated when you watch it.It can be considered a slow burn, but honestly, this movie creeped me out from the start. It's very artsy, but it has such a genuinely dreadful air about it that you feel a knot tying in your stomach as you watch.Very few jumpscares, but for me they were all necessary and freaked me tf out. It's very open ended, you kind of get to decide for yourself how you think it ends. Personally, I feel it has something to do with Kevin being trapped in purgatory, or just being stuck in the void forever, and that makes me feel so very empty.I was scared to get my phone from my bedroom to type this review after watching. Really a good watch if you appreciate a more indie, unique approach to horror. Standing ovation to the director, he really made a masterpiece.Sidenote, who else feels absolutely AWFUL for the little kids???",2022-11-27
"I always had terrible nightmares as a kid which included sleep paralysis. Eventually in my teens I stopped having nightmares and sleep paralysis completely. I would have the occasional bad dream, but not a nightmare that would wake me up with an elevated heartrate. But after watching Skinamarink, I've had my my first real nightmare in over 14 years that I woke up from with a heart racing.""Skinamarink"" is more of an experience as opposed to a traditional plot driven movie. An experience that took me back to my childhood where I had a fear of the dark. Unbeknownst to my younger self, that fear was actually a fear of the unknown which ""Skinamarink"" 100% taps into.This film follows the story of 2 kids being alone in their home in the dark. Pretty simple in concept, but masterful in execution.Unnatural camera angles, abrupt noises, and minimal actual human connection in this film leave the viewer feeling as helpless as the children in the film.When looking at this film in a literal sense, it's hard to pinpoint what exactly is happening and the ending doesn't necessarily give a cohesive answer. Are the paranormal events you are seeing actually happening to these characters? Is this a shared psychosis episode, or even their imaginations? Is this just a crazy nightmare a kid is having that we are getting a glimpse at? Who knows.The entire film has a static-like grain over it which some viewers might find off-putting, but to me it brought back memories of being a kid looking into the darkness and seeing that same static-like grain in my vision.If you don't like slow experiences, this movie really isn't for you. This is definitely an ""artsy"" film and not something general audiences would like. However, for people looking for a truly mental experience, watch this film.",2022-11-20
"The concept is great. The way it was filmed is actually quite interesting. However, there's not enough explained and no discernible story to even fill in the blanks. There's so much wasted frames of random parts of rooms. You have such a loose idea what is happening. You have no idea what you are supposed to be afraid of. You can't tell who is talking. You can't tell what you are hearing. They use subtitles to generate dialogue from unintelligible sounds/voices. I don't mind using my imagination to generate an idea of what is happening off screen, but unfortunately, the entire movie takes place out of frame. The stoic nature of both children, considering what is happening to them, prevents the viewer from relating to the situation and prevents immersion into the ""story"". This style creates an incredible sense of dread it just never delivers. We should see more horror movies filmed like this in the future, but it needs to be improved on.",2023-03-02
"When I was 4 or 5, I had a nightmare that my parents had gotten on a train at night and left me alone. I woke up crying and ran to my parents' room to make sure they were there. As an adult, this seems a bit silly, but as a child, it was terrifying. What could be worse than being abandoned by the people who were your protectors and your bridge to the rest of the world?Skinamarink tries to capture that feeling -- to make you remember what it was like to need a caretaker and to feel helpless when alone. I can honestly say that I have never seen anything like this before. I have seen reviewers mention Lynch and Kafka. To me, it felt most like Tarkovsky - particularly Stalker. Clearly, this is a divisive film. As others have said, if you don't buy into the concept, it will be a slow 100 minutes. That said, my advice to help people connect with this film is twofold. First, watch this at home, preferably in the dark and alone. I think this is the only way to feel the sense of abandonment and lingering dread. You will not get the emotion of this movie if there are distractions. Second, if you can, watch it with subtitles. There are some hardcoded subs in the film to help the viewer understand the quiet voices, but the subs I used helped identify some of the random sounds and who is speaking. This is important because most of the action occurs off camera.",2022-12-11

I sat through it until the end, and I have no idea why except it gave me the right to leave a review.From the statement at the beginning, I assume this was filmed during the pandemic? I have to say that it really does look like it.It was listed as horror. It's more like horrific. Writing scripts and directing may not be your forte.Those of you looking to maybe give this a try...

The movie was repetitive and way too long to just be looking at ceiling corners, toys on the floors and listening to white noise static. There was no pay off. Straight trash. At one point: I was like, ""give me something man! Anything!"" Nope. Just more bad angles and child whispers. I wanted to like this movie. I just give props to the director for believing in this and seeing through to the end. I'm sure it made sense to him.",2023-01-16

At least nothing during the 30mins.I imposed myself to watch the 30 first mins to see if anything would happen but beside seeing dark hallways, wooden doors, the ceiling and the floor and maybe 10 lines of dialog coming from nowhere (80% of it being just "" dad...? "") nothing happened. I even tried to Speedrun the movie to see if anything would change... in conclusion: Ceiling, door, ceiling, door, wall, door, ceiling, floor, ceiling, door, ceiling, wall, door.... until the very end.I can't believe some magazine critics rated it as a great and scary movie. How can a blank wall be frightening?!",2023-09-13
"This movie is a grift. Its 1 hour and 40 minutes of art school experimentalism that looks contrived and falsely retro.The director thought he was making something really cool and avant-garde, but if people are honest with themselves they will admit that its boring and pretentious footage that was mass marketed to mainstream audiences as a must see horror film.""Skinamarink"" is going to make things difficult for other new filmmakers to get their horror projects made and shown on the big screen. Why? Because its really difficult for a small horror film to make it into theatre distribution, and a film like ""Skinamarink"", which is nothing more than an experimental short film concept, makes audiences more cynical. Not to mention theatre owners. People are becoming wary of the hype, and aren't going to pay for vanity projects with questionable promotion.This movie was cleverly leaked and the faux outrage on reddit and other film sites and blogs drove the buzz. It was supposed to be a ""creepy"", nightmarish horror film, marketed to the mainstream horror community. What we got was an arthouse movie with no context for anything, no perspective, and no explanation. Its over 1 1/2 hours of out- of- frame video and upside down camera angles. Two kids padding around a house at night. Odd noises, Cartoons. Old school filters. But its not scary.""I want the audience to come to their own conclusions."" Really? That's just lazy filmmaking.I didn't pay to watch this film in a theatre. I had heard many negative comments about people who did pay to see it, then felt ripped off. It may be worth streaming and having on in your house as background wallpaper. Just don't pay good money for it.",2023-02-05
"I imagine that ""Skinamarink"" will be utilized during enhanced interrogation - if I was a prisoner and my captives sat me down and played this movie on a loop, I'd admit to anything to make it end. ""Skinamarink"" is marketed as a horror film, but the only thing I found scary about it was how frighteningly bored I found myself while watching it.The more I think about this movie, the less I like it. Now, keep in mind that I saw this movie with two friends, and both of them had the complete opposite opinion; in fact, they found this movie so scary at times that they had to avert their gaze from the screen because they were afraid of what they might see. I, on the other hand, couldn't help but look at the screen because I was in utter disbelief at what I was watching. And honestly, I am shocked that people find this film scary.Shot on a shoestring budget, ""Skinamarink"" is less a movie and more a collection of random shots. You'll see: a shot of lego bricks on a carpet; a TV playing classic cartoons; a POV shot of someone walking up/down the stairs; and other random, incomprehensible scenes that I really can't remember because of how unmemorable this movie was to me. With an hour and 40 minute running time, you'll spend a majority of this film looking at nothing - ""Skinamarink"" is a nothing movie, because nothing happens. There is no plot; everything is up to viewer interpretation, except that there's really nothing to interpret.Is this movie scary? Not to me. My friends said they were afraid of what might happen next - I was not afraid of what might happen next, because nothing ever happened. Movies like ""Sinister"" or ""Insidious: Chapter 3"" had me so scared at what was actually on screen; the imagery was so disturbing that I had to watch half of those movies through my fingers. ""Skinamarink,"" however, had no disturbing imagery, unless you consider shots of walls, staircases, and toys scary.There's nothing more to say about this movie other than I seriously question anyone who legitimately found this movie frightening. I cannot fathom anyone actually being scared of this movie - my own friends said this scared them, and I don't believe them, because this movie had nothing scary in it at all. Definitely skip this one unless you want to take an hour and 40 minute nap.",2023-01-25
"What to say about 'Skinamarink'? I have so many mixed feelings about this one. On the one hand, it is about as unique as films come. On the other hand I'm not really sure it worked. There's just too much downtime and nothing happening for long periods.Now, nothing happening for long periods reminds of the description of another horror film, in fact one of my favourite horror films of all time - 'Paranormal Activity'. So it doesn't necessarily have to be a death sentence. In the case of that film though the payoff was amazing. I really needed this film to have a powerful ending and it simply failed on that front.I think the majority of people are going to struggle with this one. There are some really well done moments that are genuinely unsettling. The in-between times though drag and it's almost impossible for your mind not to wander. I really wanted to like this film but it just wasn't for me. 5/10.",2023-01-12
"Skinnamarink is quite literally the stuff of nightmares. I didn't know what I was in for when I started the film, but I had heard some serious buzz, both positive and negative alike. Without a doubt, after watching it, it ranks among the most harrowing movies I've ever seen. The conception and execution of the film were incredibly innovative, creating an incomparable cinematic experience. In a day and age where sometimes it feels as if you're watching the same thing over and over again, it's refreshing to not completely have a grasp on what you're seeing. It's a film that feels rooted in evil and exists somewhere between our dreams and reality. It elicits the type of primal, raw fear that can shake a person to their core. I have to assume that the naysayers cursing this movie's name never genuinely gave it a chance, because if they would've just exercised some patience and stayed engaged, I'm confident the opinions concerning this film would be much less divided. I must implore you, though, to watch Skinamarink late at night, alone, and with the volume turned wayyy up. If you're not willing to step out on a limb and watch something a little different, you're passing up on a true terror-inducing work of art.",2023-04-18
"This is obviously a divisive movie, but there is something that can clear things up : The first 5 minutes. If you watch the first 5 minutes thinking that this is something interesting, you will find interesting at least, the rest of the movie. Whereas, if you are like ""What the hell am i watching"", then, don't watch the rest of it. Definitely it's not your cup of tea.Personally, i find it scary and intense. I had covered my eyes with my fingers at some parts, watching the movie through the gap of them. Not the bravest man of the world for sure, but i have watched hundreds of horror movies and i was not that terrified.I applaud movies like these, because the creators try something different. They try to be innovative and not to repeat the same horror concepts/patterns. There is originality and vision here, mostly concerning the directing, i mean, the script is not necessarily something newfound, but the direction is. It's definitely a flawed movie because it should have been 15 minutes shorter, at least. Frankly, this is such a big mistake that i can't even comprehend how the director didn't realize it. I can cope with the editing because it is creepy and weird, but the duration of the movie is undeniably too long.In any case, i wish other horror movies be so daring and ambitious. This is not a very good movie but it's a ""very good"" nightmare. ( And a good movie). Imagine David Lynch losing 50% of his brilliance and deciding to create an experimental horror movie for his friends to watch, not for the public. That's not an insult for Kyle Ball because Lynch is phenomenal and a half David Lynch is still a great artist.",2023-01-26
"I was so hype for this movie....
I love artsy fartsy wacky stuff ....
But this.... This was absolute nonsense from start to finish...
My boyfriend nearly had a seizure from the grainy flashing lights that led to nothing...
It all led to....nothing...
I hate to trash anyone's project. Someone worked hard on this. But my lord! It was so bad and if you don't want to find yourself feeling as robbed and irritated as we are right now, I gotta tell ya- avoid this one.As a parent, anything involving children does get to me...just imagining something like this happening to some youngsters is heartbreaking.. but that's about all it got outta me...kids alone in a dark house made my heart sad. That's it.We actually started fast forwarding just to get it over with.",2023-09-16
"So, here's the thing.The movie excels at creating disorienting atmosphere, but once you've seen the first twenty minutes, you've seen the whole thing.Two kids wonder around a barely-lit house in grainy, oddly-shot static shots. You see the corner of a doorframe. Cut to a pair of feet. Some lego on the floor. A table leg. It's all so blurry that you'll be squinting for almost the entire runtime. This bizarre directing style is fairly offputting.Sprinkle in some unintelligible whispering, vague spooky noises, and Blair Witch-esque ""DID YOU SEE THAT?""s, and that's basically Skinamarink. In fact, it's a LOT like Blair Witch, but with far less interesting characters.",2022-11-28
"What the heck did I just not watch all the way through? Staring film grain, dead pixels, Lego, laminate flooring, 1/2 cut pile, pickets, nice MDF baseboards, bi-fold doors, hallways and an old TV. What a cast. I was pretty impressed with the not lit house and the lack of focal points to concentrate on. The need for Advil from the eye strain and migraine that followed by watching this wanna be art piece was useful. I couldn't even finish this and I never do that. I have also never walked out of a theater either but this would be the one time. I wish a certain streaming service would allow users to rate films so we can decide then at not later.",2023-08-25
"I tried to give it time but after 30 minutes, I bailed. It was either that or become catatonic from boredom. In my opinion, the only people who would find this slightly scary are those with some form of fear of abandonment. Otherwise this is just as exciting as a 3 year old's birthday party is for an adult.Also, for the time I did watch, all I saw were children's feet, darkness, the tops of doors, weird angles, and unmade beds. If the creators were going for artsy then I guess to some degree, bravo, otherwise, I have NO freaking idea. Don't waste your time is my only recommendation on this movie.",2023-02-02
"I'll start off with what I admire about the film first.You have to hand it to Kyle Edward Bell for having a $15K Film land distribution with IFC Midnight and Shudder.That in itself is a remarkable feat. It also made its budget back six times.Kudos to the team.The not so good - this film is utterly dull. I love arthouse/abstract films. I love a slow burn horror. This film disappointed - and then some.I'm glad I waited for this to come out on Shudder - because the audio track is so low. Most of the film sounds like spooky ASMR. Even with the film's included subtitles - it was very challenging to understand the dialogue.I'd say if this was a short film, it would be a far more engaging story.I'd rank this film along with two other over-hyped snoozefests ""Blair Witch Project"" and ""We are all going to world's fair"".I wanted to like this a whole lot more than I did in reality.",2023-02-04
"July 2023: This film is rated, by a few outlets, as the best Horror film of 2023 thus far.No. No it isn't. Not even remotely.Although I can appreciate the general concept, which is quite interesting, and the attempted execution, this film is ultimately so very painful to watch.It may have worked as a short film, but the end result is one hundred minutes of excruciating nothingness that ends with there not actually being any point at all....and there is nothing even remotely frightening, scary or even somewhat unsettling about the film.It is just an outright bore.Which, I guess, proves why this film is also seen as the most divisive film of the year so far, as it has been praised by many, leaving just as many scratching their heads and wanting their one hundred minutes back.",2023-07-08
"I went to see a horror film but what I ended up seeing is some sort of art film from Shudder. Funny, I would have expected this from BlumHouse. Actually, BlumHouse is more about blending genres with horror. That's not what's going on here. On one side I'm glad I went to see this in a movie theatre because it was the only way to get me to concentrate on this. On the other side, I had to spend money to see this.Its one of those situations where people complain because the movies that come out are not originally. Well, this is an original concept that makes me realize why studios don't make movies with original ideas.Can't say it was bad, because I'm still not sure what I saw. I will say its an acquired taste.",2023-01-15
"Was it scary? No. Was there built up tension? No. Was the sound invoking anything? Yes pure annoyance in the white noise and random louder segments. Let me help you build your expectation. Long shots of grainy hallways, children's toys in the floor and children feet walking, random dialogue that you can barely hear every 10 minutes. The whole movie is grainy video that never focuses on anything worth watching. If this had been a 15 minute short, it may be worth a watch for the concept. Unfortunately this is 100 minutes of boredom and wishing it would just find a moment entertainment. Given we had 3 sleepers just on our row in the cinema, managing to stay awake the full 100 minutes was a miracle.",2022-10-20
"This film isn't a story, but rather, an immersion into an uncomfortable psychological state derived from defamiliarization, the uncanny horror of nostalgia, and an uncertainty regarding the boundaries of reality that one experiences during childhood.If you watch this film, expect to sit for an extended period of time with some long forgotten part of yourself, trapped and alone in the flickering dimness, without any source of comfort or relief.This is unlikely to appeal to a lot of people.However, if you are a fan of analog horror, liminal spaces, weirdcore and dreamcore, or nostalgia-induced existential dread, you might really enjoy this experience.",2023-02-02
"I consider myself a die hard horror movie fan. I watched THOUSANDS and beleive me most of them were disappointing.So nowdays I try to find something different and ""new"" to watch, and I tried this. Man, what a waste of time. A camera trying to scare us with the classic cheap tricks, filming in the dark, no pace, no scares. No explanation, two kids whispering for 100 minutes and we're supposed to be scared?This is a Blair Witch project without the scares. I'm not gonna tell you to a avoid this film. See for yourself and you'll understand. Tik Tok is praising this film, do I need to say more? No.They'll give you the ""this is not for everyone"" motto. Guess what. This is for NOONE.",2023-01-16
"Chompcrc here. I give the filmmakers respect for taking chances, and boy did they take chances. This is completely experimental. There is no discernible plot, story or character arcs. It is completely unclear what the movie is actually about. Like much better films before it, there can be multiple interpretations of this movie. The problem is, you don't want to go through the trouble. The movie is so boring and unwatchable that the tedium of the experience leaves you feeling empty and unsatisfied. Rule number one in filmmaking: the movie needs to be fulfilling. It needs to be entertaining on some level. You need to want to sit through it. I couldn't wait for this to end. They blew an opportunity to make a decent short film, or even one of the best horror films of the year. All it really needed was some sort of action and clear direction. I don't mean action as in gunfights or car chases. I mean something more than a flashlight clicking on and off. When I say nothing happens in this movie, I mean NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS MOVIE! Who knows, maybe I'm just not smart enough to get it, but like I said, I don't care to. Knowing what this movie is ""really"" about will not salvage it. The experience was far too miserable. I can honestly say that I have never been this bored and irritated with a movie in my life, and I've seen some crap.",2023-02-07

A bunch of pictures of nothing and very loud and annoying cartoon sounds playing in the background?? And f^^k whatever any of you gonna say about how this is a ""great horror"" about the fear of the unknown or how it perfectly depicts childhood fantasies because you'd only be making sh^t up to comfort yourselves about the actual 2 hours you wasted on absolute NOTHING. All I see is a broke staff who felt like selling sh^t and fortunately for them found people dumb enough to ""enjoy"" and promote it. I rarely leave reviews but this one got me so p^ssed that I'd give it a 0/10 if I could. If only it wasn't that long, maybe then I wouldn't have expected so much from it.",2023-02-25

Factola. So stop there. Threaten to show your friends this movie after scaring them with the trailer. Say, "" I'm going to make you watch it"". But you won't because you've read this review and stopped yourself from watching the film.

Just skip it.",2023-09-06
"This does not even qualify as a movie. There are no actors that you can actually see, no plot to speak of, and just lots of dark shots of ceilings and walls. There is a voice, but in order to even make out what it is saying you have to have the captions on. And that's when they aren't provided for you. A complete and total waste of time. It earned 1 star because it felt creepy but for no distinguishable reason other than it looked like it was filmed terribly on purpose. And also zero stars is not an option. I am actually mad that I can't get the time I wasted watching this back. The trailer for the film is the only thing worth your time. And I NEED to point out, the trailer might have more dialogue than the actual thing I just watched, that I refuse to refer to as a movie. Genuinely terrible. Like watching old home videos filmed by a 4 year old obsessed with poor lighting and walls. I can not stress enough, how bad this is. Whatever rating is positive had to either have been a relative of the film makers or one of the 40 some people that received a special thanks at the beginning of whatever it was I just witnessed.",2023-02-12
"""Skinamarink"" is the scariest horror film I've seen in a long time. By the use of a traditional filming camera (the film takes place in 1995), my first thought was ""omg, another rip-off of 'Paranormal Activity'"". Man, I was completely wrong, this is one of the most authorial films I watched in years.First of all, a decision that can be a red flag for some people but in my opinion, it was a crazy idea: the film is 100% suggestive. A HUNDRED PERCENT! The camera always focuses on the ceiling, on the floor, on furniture, but never on the cast. You never see the faces of anybody.I never saw a film following this path before, and the thriller atmosphere is extraordinary since the first minute. The director invites you to mount the scenes in your head, with few visual resources, and as a person who loves puzzles, I was completely involved, like in ""Incantation"".The movie's pace is questionable, but honestly, I think it wouldn't have half the impact if it was faster. And there are two extraordinarily built ""jumpscare"" moments that gave me goosebumps. What an experience, and this is a movie that's quite easy to write a review without spoilers because any deep information would not make sense!If you want to know about the movie, you must watch the movie. And it's worth every second! It may be divisible, but for me, is one of the best films of the year.",2022-12-03
"Dear Mr Director of this experimental horror movie,Please do not experiment anymore. Ever.I went into this movie expecting a chilling 90's style mockumentary but all I got wasA) odd camera angles
B) constant dim lighting
C) dialog that I didnt hear half the time
D) subtitles for random dialog
E) random black scenes
F) random jumpscares
G) confusing audio cuesand a whole lot of nonsense.The only good part was that it looked liked it was recorded on an old vhs camera which gave it some kind of scary vibe but the execution itself was dreadfully dull.Also, I still have no idea what the story was.",2023-09-03
"This was one of the most boring hard to watch movies I've seen in a long time. I love art house. I love Indie, and I am very patient with more up-and-coming directors. I'm not looking for a master blockbuster! But I had to walk out after like 40 minutes because I knew there was another hour left. I think, poorly cropped shots of the corner of the room or a lamp and the flickering light that went on forever with poor foley of kids walking was hard to bear any longer and I feel bad. It's horrible. There's definitely a really good short movie in here if this was 30 minutes in total, I think it would've been really good but no tension was actually being built if every 45 second shot of a lightbulb went to another 45 second shot of a door doing nothing. It felt like something my sisters and I would make on an old camcorder when we were kids. I understand it feeling like a child's actual nightmare which it did and I totally get what Director was doing and I respect his attempt, but I think it was like an overindulgent art house mess. There is definitely a talented Director in that movie but it's just not anything I saw him there worth staying for sadly.",2023-01-18
"I'm not exaggerating here. This may very well be the worst movie I've ever seen and/or the most boring. This... I don't even know what to call this. Is it even really a movie? I actually had to watch it twice because I fell asleep in the middle of it the first time from sheer boredom. It seems like they were trying to do something like Paranormal Activity, but geez, talk about a massive fail. I mean, I get the creative choice and see what they were trying to do, but it was a horrible decision that didn't work.Number one problem, the movie is boring. Literally nothing happens in it. There's no plot, no story, nothing. We barely even have characters, if you can even call them that. Literally 95% of the movie is just shots of furniture, toys, walls, doors, etc, while you occasionally hear a character talk in the background. You can barely even call it dialogue too, since there was so little of it that I'd be surprised if the script was more than 2 pages. And they all whisper literally all the time. Half the time they talk so quietly that they put subtitles just so you can tell what they're saying. They're not even conversations, just random sentences that occasionally form a verbal exchange every several minutes.Other than that, the movie is just different shots of the house, that's it. You literally don't ever even see the characters, you just catch glimpses of their feet and the tops of their heads every so often. Other than that, you're just staring at different angles of the house where nothing happens. There will literally be scenes that are 2-3 minutes long of just a wall where nothing happens and no one says anything before the scene changes to somewhere else.Truthfully, this movie shouldn't have been more than 15 minutes tops, yet it was painfully stretched out into an hour and forty minutes. There is actually a scene that goes on for about 3 minutes that shows some old school cartoon scene on loop that repeats about 20 times, and then nothing comes of it, the camera just changes to a different angle. You're just waiting and waiting and waiting for something to happen, and it never does. And when anything does finally happen, and I use that term loosely, it's off-screen, so you don't even see anything.There is just one thing that keeps this from me giving it a 1/10, and that's that it does have maybe 4 or 5 scenes, at most, that show some creepy imagery that puts you on the edge of your seat. Those scenes are effective in delivering a creep factor, but that's it. But nothing ever comes from them though. For example, there's a shot of the doorway into a dark room that shows the shadowy outline of a person inside it. The camera lingers there for about 2 minutes, then the scene changes and nothing happens. Or you see the back of a person's head and watch as they slowly fade away without moving for about 3 minutes, and then that's it, scene over, more staring at a chair or a wall or a pile of toys for another 8 minutes or so.So when I say nothing happens, I mean nothing happens. There's no plot, nothing is ever explained, you have no idea what's going on. It's just minutes upon minutes of different angles of different rooms of the houses where you occasionally see someone's feet walk by or you see the top of their head, and some dialogue is whispered every so often. That's the whole movie. The highest praise I can give this movie is that it's like the build-up scene to a jump scare that drags on forever, but the jump scare simply never comes. Yes, that is meant to be a compliment, so you can probably imagine just how bad the movie is.And if all this boring nonsense wasn't enough, the movie just ends. There's no beginning to the movie, it just starts, and no end. It's just, here's a bunch of random scenes with some characters whispering every so often, ok movie over. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this snooze-fest.",2023-03-14
"These other reviews are hilarious. This movie offers absolutely ZERO. Zero connection, zero emotion, zero scare, ZEROOOOO. The best part of it is the noise the 8mm film makes. That soothing scratchy humming sound. Other than that this dumpster fire is one and forty minute of garbage. Same scene happening over and over and over again. How did this get distributed. Shudder offers a lot of garbage to watch so it makes total sense. But why did IFC midnight swoop the garbage up? I'm a horror fan as it is my favorite genre of film. Skinmamarink or whatever tf it's called is not a horror. It was an hour and forty mins of my life I'll never get back. Enough with these 5 and above star reviews. 👎🏻👎🏻 And a long fart noise.",2023-02-07
"There is nothing here. There's no story, no dialogue, no action, no character development, no good scares other than cheap jump scares. There's no movie here. Nothing. The 90s VHS vibe is literally the only interesting thing about it. But that's all superficial. You need a story. You need something to pull people in and this movie doesn't have that. If that's all you have, your movie looks like an art student's film. An art student from a community college. Who shouldn't be making any kind of films in the first place.The jump scares were all extremely frustrating. They felt cheap and unnecessary. If all your movie has to scare people are jump scares, that says something. Very late into the film, there's one decent scare that got me pretty good. That's it. The other ones were infuriating.The biggest Takeaway is that I still do not know what this movie was about. That's not because it flew over my head. It's because this movie sucks.",2023-02-08
"Every once in a while I come across something that makes me wonder if people just want to appreciate something as art because they were told it was such by someone else. That's exactly what I thought about with Skinamarink. There is really nothing here as far as a decent or even bad movie.I went through some articles explaining what Skinamarink is about and what it meant to them and what the director was going for. That honestly didn't help any. There is so little to take from this movie that I would recommend anyone who can't look at a blue painted canvas and be amazed at the quality of art it is stay as far away from this film as possible. There isn't anything at the end in case you start watching it and think it HAS TO go somewhere.I keep hearing and reading people say that it was made off of a $15,000 budget. My question to that is how? I'm not sure it would've taken more than a few hundred bucks to make this without much motivation to keep the budget down.",2023-03-03
"I was really excited to watch this movie after reading some articles and opinions that called it a terrifying horror movie and stating its popularity unexpectedly spread like wildfire. I was also interested because it is Canadian-made and I believe I read the director filmed it in his own home. If it was that popular, it must be really, really good... right?Virtually nothing happened in at least 90% of the first hour of the movie. Nothing. I had to fight to stay awake and to not give up on it. I wanted to know why some people loved it so much and what made it so scary, so I kept holding out hope.There were a few brief moments where I thought, ""Okay, now we're getting somewhere. Something is going to happen."" It NEVER got anywhere.I jumped once because of a really loud noise after endless silence.In the last half hour, there was some whispering and some very random things happened after long stretches of silence and seeing nothing.If I hadn't read the description of the movie before watching it, I wouldn't have had a sweet clue what the movie was about and what was going on. Honestly, I still didn't have a sweet clue what was going on, and it wasn't so much from confusion itself. It was because there was no substance and no storyline to the movie.I stubbornly watched it until the end, questioning why I put myself through the boredom.I'm just so disappointed. I really wanted to like and support the movie. The written plot had great potential and it makes me sad to think of what could have been an awesome movie.I hate to tear the director down, because he's probably so proud of his work, but I'd love to see what someone more established in the horror movie business could do with the same plot.",2023-02-14
Over the years and ESPECIALLY now people have over complicated what a films purpose is let me simplify it for ALL of you it IS to be ENTERTAINING!! It can be scary it can be educational emotional the movie can make you happy make you sad it can be about love war peace just about ANYTHING but it has to be ENTERTAINING and it has to have SOME kind of story or a WAY of being entertaining. This film has NONE OF THAT it's by far the worst THING I have no make that we have seen it fits into NO genre as of this time films have no GARBAGE genre!! The quality of this film is less than terrible it's an insult that they charged people to see it. It's even worse that people have ACTUALLY given this any kind of credit for being anything other than garbage it's not a film it should be thrown away. I don't bother addressing critics they have 1 function it's to tell us what we're suppose to like and dislike when in reality it's simple like art it's to ENTERTAIN YOU TO inspire you. Garbage isn't inspiring and it most certainly isn't ENTERTAINING!! Do yourself a HUGE favor go watch a rerun of the loveboat or the bachelor PASS ON THIS I have to go take a Tylenol now and then watch Princess Bride IMMEDIATELY!!,2023-02-12
"So we have to ask ourselves what is cinema ? And if you have a camera and an idea and collections of retro filters can you do the magic ? My answer is No not until you don't know the formula !This nonsense film that i call it a wasting time machine that i shame to even call it a film works like HORN and a wake up call to everyone who's out there and want to make a movie !If you have a camera and don't know squad about angles and frames and shots ! Don't know a squad about buildup and characters and event a story pls just don't waste our time and do something else although some might find this movie so talented and new or what ever else , if you want to call something this weird , unique ! It is up to you but to me who grew up with cinema and movies naah this movie doesn't even have a story to even catch you .From the start this movie tells you that i'm about to do something new and weird but i don't have the actual skill to execute it . Director tries to be a copycat of david lynch and this is the actual problem !And my recommendation :
don't watch this movie even if you want to just throw away your 1 hour and 40 minutes of your day .",2023-02-27
Watch this if you want to go to sleep. If you want plot/story/horror/entertainment or similar dont bother. If your an art type person have you fill of pretentious tripe and pre red this is for intellectual people only or whatever the latest insult is to make yourself feel more important than us meet mortals. The fact this is low budget is not the issue. The issue was that 15k or thereabouts was water in this utter tripe instead of giving the money to a good bank a charity or some other good cause that would have made a difference in the world. The only effect this should have is to ensure the director never works again.,2023-02-11
"Just 5 minutes in, you'll already be second guessing your decision to throw away over 90 minutes of your life on this ""movie"". In essence, it's an endless stream of upward angles and floor-level shots. It's as if the cameraman only had the option of filming wearing a neck brace or lying face flat in the floor. While these angles are unusual for a film they are not sufficient to make it ""horror"". Horr-ible is more applicable.I can't help but feel as though the director was trying to hard to be unique that they sacrificed any sort of effort to make a watchable film that actually entertains. This entire thing felt as though I lied flat in the floor, staring at the ceiling and turning the light switch off and on for an hour and 40 minutes.Don't bother wasting a single minute of your life on this garbage unless you just truly hate yourself and want to Take it out on your eyeballs.At this point I'm just trying to fill the rest of the space because this stupid app says that my review is too short so I'm just trying words to fill space, much like how the director of this movie did with their script.",2023-02-07
"HOW?! WHY?! WHAT?!These are the questions I had during this movie. At one point during the movie, I heard the popcorn machine humming outside the the theater and I started thinking about the popcorn machine because it was infinitely more exciting than what I was watching on the screen. If I heard this movie was filmed by a 5 year old, I wouldn't be surprised. There is, at least, 20 minutes of useless time in this movie which could be cut without a single change to the ""storyline"" (and I'm using that term very broadly).I've seen and loved slow burn movies. I've stayed during movies where half of the theaters left. I've thought other movies earned a one star review, but this movie makes one star seem like I'm giving this movie more than what it deserves.But...this...this is just not a movie. I don't know how this movie even made it to the cinema.",2023-01-27
"I have so much I could say about this movie, but I already feel like I've wasted too much of my life on it just by watching it. Holy smokes, I can't believe I'm gonna even write this review.I was excited for this movie, really and truly. I love horror, I love art films, love anything experimental and different, aaaaaand I was basically left annoyed and unfulfilled. I felt ripped off and lied to by everyone that said anything good about this film.The plot is so thin that you'll end up with a papercut.The characters have no dimension, and you don't even really see them. You might see an ankle or two a couple times if you're actually able to keep your eyes on the screen. Mine spent most of the time looking around the room because staring at a blank wall was more entertaining than this film. Oh wait... that basically WAS the film. Every other shot is just a corner of a wall, or a lamp in the dark. WAY too many shots are just cartoons blaring on a TV in a dark room. I'm actually kind of inspired to recut this movie and take out all the empty shots and see what we are left with. The shots linger for way too long, and not in a way that seems creepy and unsettling, just in a way that's outright annoying. I kept skipping ahead.Every now and then someone will speak, but in the most unnatural way that nobody ever speaks. One kid will mumble something that requires subtitles to understand, then there's like 30-45 seconds of silence before the other kid responds in an equally indecipherable way. Funny part is, they're the easiest part of the film to understand. The entity doesn't even really actually speak, it's just weird noises with subtitles that pretend like it's speaking? It doesn't sound creepy or anything, it's just downright lazy. When Kevin finally calls the police, you can't hear the operator, it's just subtitles. Really? I guess the budget didn't allow for an extra voice to be cast. At the same time that you can't hear the operator, his whispering is just WAY too loud.Seriously, the sound mixing in this is as if it was someone's first time working with sound, or maybe possibly even hearing sound for the first time in their life. I was constantly changing the volume because it's so poorly done.By the way, everything you've read about this film that makes it sound interesting, is grossly exaggerated. I turned it off at 40 minutes because nothing had happened yet, (and not in the way that other movies have nothing happen as in boring stuff happens, I mean LITERALLY NOTHING HAPPENS) and I googled the ending of the plot. The Wiki plot makes it sound *almost* watchable, but it embellishes a lot. I decided to give it a second shot because it sounded like it would pick up. Not saying they lie per say, but for example, one part of the plot is that Kevin stabs himself in the eye because the entity tells him to, but it's just a blurry shot of the kid sitting there being told to do it, and then it cuts to the next clip. It's implied, sure, but at no point does that actually happen in the movie.The first time you actually see Kaylee is when her eyes and mouth are taken from her, but like... we never saw her with them, so why the - would we care that she lost them. There's no shock value because there's no contrast, because we've never seen her face before. Plus, you can barely even see her because it's so dark and grainy. It probably sounds dumb to put it that way, of course someone without features would be creepy right? You'd think so, wouldn't you. Heh. Not the case.Even the jump scares fall flat. All of them are just quiet clip, quiet clip, LOUD CLIP, but the thing is you're just so damn bored that even a jump scare won't rouse you.Seriously, just stare at the corner of your bedroom if you want to see this movie, because that's basically it.If you've seen toys that haven't been picked up off the floor then you've seen the movie.It's boring, it's lazy, it's faked being grainy/low quality, it's terrible sound mixing, it's horrendous writing, it's awful acting, it's everything that you expect to come out of a cesspool like Edmonton.",2023-02-25
"A strong 0/10. I can't believe I finally made an account just to save people from watching this colossal disaster. 95% of the movie is shots of walls and floors. Please understand that, it's entirely just camera footage of walls and floors and feet. There is no plot and no real dialogue. Its not even experimental, it actually seems like the creator was experimenting with really hard drugs when he decided to make this. I think this movie should be illegal in all 195 countries. Its criminal how it is strictly just theft of 100 minutes, not even theft because it just leaves you annoyed. Crazy bad.",2023-01-21
I watched this the first time because some site said it was the best horror of the year so far. I didn't realize I had fallen asleep but did see the ending and felt very confused. How is this horror? I watched it again just to be sure I didn't missing. I missed maybe 40 minutes or so the first time and yet I really didn't miss a thing. I don't know what they were going for...viewer imagination I guess. I absolutely love the found footage type movies but skinamarink while yes it is horror didn't even scare my 11 year old daughter. She felt as I did...what the hell was that? And the only way this would be the best horror of the year is if it came out Jan 1 and had 0 competition.,2023-06-22
"SKINAMARINK (2022) **1/2 Lucas Paul, Dali Rose Tetreault, Jaime Hill, Ross Paul. Novice filmmaker Kyle Edward Ball's endurance test of a horror film is a mix of frustration and pure dread as two young children spend a dark night at home with eerie silences while sudden bursts of sound and unknown entities mix (more of the former than the latter). While the effective camera work of grainy 'found footage' ish vibes are engrained for the look and feel of this set in 1995 (for inexplicable reasons) preys more on the imagination of WTF is in the dark shadows of our environs, and more unsettling, our minds.",2023-01-15
"I have NO idea what some of the other reviewers are talking about when they say this movie is ""horror done right"". It's completely incomprehensible with nothing but a handful of cheap, loud jump scares. I literally would rather have sat and watched paint dry at least then I wouldn't have had to pretend anything else was supposed to be going on.I mean it, this movie is an endurance test of how long you can stand to look at nothing. There are basically no visuals, no characters, no plot, it's 80% staring at walls and ceilings. The whole thing feels like somebodies first year film school project, which would have been fine to fill 15 minutes but instead has the absolute audacity to waste 100 minutes of your life.",2022-11-28
"I really try to seek out unusual films and I think I give the benefit of the doubt if a director is trying to do something new and different. This, however, is truly horrible. 100 minutes of grainy film of kids wandering around their house at night. Are mom and dad home? We really never know. Stuff inexplicably moves around onto the walls and ceiling. Near the end an evil spirit (I guess) tells one of the kids to stick a knife in his eye. No screaming, but he calls 911 -- no one ever comes. Apparently 500+ days elapse? And then?? Don't waste your time.This could have been a C+ student film if it was 30-40 minutes, but certainly never should have made a release to streaming.",2023-09-17
"The worst part was feeling like I was being held hostage by this movie. Anxiously waiting for anything at all to happen and kept thinking it's a slow burn it will get better . There will be a big pay out on terror by the end. Nope, an hour and forty min of nothing. They should pay the audience to watch it. At one point it became a battle of the wills , me against this awful boring movie. I stuck it out but who really lost here , I'm 1 hour and 40 min closer to death and spent my time watching this crap. There in lies the scariest and most disturbing things art of this movie. Worst movie I've ever seen and by the end I was actually angry .",2023-09-22
"My only question: where did the filmmakers spend the $15k on this movie? To pay people to rate it over a 5, would be my guess. No plot, no action, horrible cinematography. I don't mind slow burn movies, if there is a pay off. But this movie goes no where. Painful to sit through as it's nothing but grainy film and whispers. Zero story, I mean no plot whatsoever. I love supporting independent film making, but this was just horrible beyond what I can even share. Take the trailer and replay it 100 times. That's the entire movie. I never write reviews but I had to after sitting through that garbage.",2023-01-16
"I cannot rate it any lower. IMDB won't let me. Boring and pretentious. It is absolutely unwatchable but what do you expect from a ""movie"" titled after a kids song by Sharon, Lois & Bram. I am not exaggerating when I say it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I love David Lynch and other experimental filmmakers. I don't require linear storytelling but this is not even a movie unless you like shots of doorways, walls and whispering and nothing else. It is like staring at a wall in dark room for 90 minutes straight or watching a VR real estate house tour online. You have better things to do with your time like watching a kettle boil, watching grass grow or taking a nap.",2023-02-05
"""Home Alone?""Since first appearing in 1984, the word, Lynchian; adjective, ""characteristic, reminiscent, or imitative of the films or television work of David Lynch,"" has been something that experimental filmmakers have greatly aspired to.And surely.Very surely?That's what first time feature film writer/director Kyle Edward Bell was himself hoping to emulate with his uneven debut, SKINAMARINK.IMDb list this as the plot:""Two children wake up in the middle of the night to find their father is missing, and all the windows and doors in their home have vanished.""There's not much more to it than that.Made for $15,000 Canadian, the filmmakers are pretty limited in what they can achieve. Trick shots and darkened corners can only achieve so much. The can't convey a story in any traditional structure.The two kids, four year old Kevin (Lucas Paul) and his big sister Kaylee (Dali Rose Tetreault) awaken in the middle of the night and are unable to find their father. This is after a brief scene where their parents talk about Kevin falling down the stairs and hurting himself, his sister says he was sleepwalking.Anyway.Middle of the night, no dad. (No mention of mom at first for some reason as well.) They decide to sleep downstairs and head that way. They watch old cartoons.Camera tricks show that the doors and windows of their home are slowly disappearing. Toys are stuck to walls, belongings vanish.At one point, back upstairs, Kaylee hears Dad's (Ross Paul) voice, he tells her to look under the bed. She does and finds nothing. Suddenly Mom (Jamie Hill) is sitting on the other side of the bed with her back to us. And then. She's gone.It quickly becomes apparent that the children are not alone, something malevolent is there with them. And it (whatever it is) is in charge.As I've said, camera tricks can only accomplish so much. And darkened corners, with nothing on screen for minutes at a time, do not, for good suspense make. At one hour and forty minutes, a good twenty-five minutes could've been (and should've been) cut.I look forward to seeing what Bell can do with a budget, he'll likely get one after this promising debut.That is all.-SmokeyKorzeniowski.",2023-02-28
"Skinamarink (2022) follows two children as they wake up in the middle of night to find their father gone. I was highly anticipating this film and for me, it really lives up the hype. This movie is so unnerving and genuinely disturbed me, it's definitely not for everyone though!The cinematography is very simplistic, proving that less is more. The footage is very grainy-looking and looks a lot older than it is, really tapping into nostalgia. The colour palettes are incredibly strong and the film has plenty of good lighting too.I absolutely adore the sound design in this film, it's extremely creepy and builds up a very effective and tense atmosphere. Also, the movie doesn't really have a score, which works in its favour as I feel a score wouldn't have been very fitting.The child actors are very good and have some great line delivery, and I like how the film slowly reveals small details about the characters whilst also leaving a lot up to the audience's imagination. While watching, I really felt like I was in the childrens' situation and I experienced all the emotions they did.This film is super experimental and definitely isn't for people who like a clear plot. I however, love surreal horror and find it to be genuinely terrifying! The movie builds up such a horrifying atmosphere and I've never seen anything like it before, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and found it to be strangely hypnotic!",2023-02-20
"If you tell me this movie is groundbreaking, interesting, artsy, then you are so full of $hit. It's the worst movie I've ever seen bar none. It's like sitting in traffic for 4 hour and you're only 30 minutes from home. Everyone involved with this movie should be ashamed of themselves. Lucky it was only $4. I love how below it says ""Does this review contain spoilers"", there is nothing to spoil...no plot, no actually character, no ending - I could go on and on at how bad this movie is and I will because I have 84 characters to go. It's so so so bad and only 44 characters to go, man this movie Sri is!",2023-02-13
"This is actually one of the most unpleasant movies I've seen. Therefore it succeeds with its mission of scaring its audience. Probably because it's a movie that takes horror to a completely different level. But a unique and original idea that makes every person uncomfortable. With aswell creepy ambience, unpleasant statics, creepy sounds and music and iconic classical creepy, but bad manuscript. Super interesting concept.The graphics are also original, stunning and innovative, but retro style that sets the style with a VHS tape. The graphics are and the filter on the camera is incredibly well done. A classic horror plotline of an old videotape being found with strangeness and paranormal activities on it, but yet an original idea.The extremely empty, slowly turning and long scenes and the scenes on the tv-screen without so much happening, create an unpleasant dynamic that tricks the brain that something is going to happen. It is one of the few horror films that succeeds in surprising and giving that feeling you are looking for in a horror film. That feeling of hiding behind the screen.Unfortunately, it fails to follow the common thread of the classic film and is sometimes a bit over the top and a bit too wierd. Maybe that's what makes it unpleasant and a good horrorfilm, but not as good as classic movie watching?A mix of darkest psychological trapped nightmares mixed with our deepest fears of our closest evolving into something dark and supernatural and aswell claustrophobia and a night that just gets weirder and weirder.A very well made film working with capturing its audience in a state of horror.""Skinamarink"" is a deep and experimental display into the classical deep and terrible nightmares being trapped into the unsettled childhood atmosphere.The short cuts of both sound and video as is was a genuine VHS edited film, creating a horrifying atmosphere.Ending is horrifying and genius! One of the best ednings ive seen in a horrorfilm!A unique and modern masterpiece of cinematic horror! It's surprisingly accurate to what it's like being a kid in a creepy dark house. There is an atmosphere unlike any other.Genuinely one of the most horrifying films i've seen.

"I have to watch the movie in three days in three different chapters, because I couldn't stand it. It was like a torture. Couldn't hear the dialogs, couldn't understand them, couldn't see anything instead a carpet, some toys, some feet walking... Very poor photography, made with ammateur camera, with ammateur lenses and with very bad taste for filmaking.It is supposed to scare you, but you start to feel sleepy instead. The children in the movie are passing through the camera, rare noises, very complicated shots, with no sense at all.I don't find the point of watching this. I had to stop it every half hour, and wait for the next day to watch it again,then wait if something happens; but nothing happens! I feel angry after watching this!1 star out of 10.",2023-02-15
"That was....truly horrendous to watch. I'm a new dad of an 18 month old so it probably resonated with me in a way it wouldn't have prior to having kids. After the movie I held my baby for almost 45 minutes crying. The cinematography was absolutely unique and captivating.SPOILERSthe concept itself, children, suddenly in a kafkaesque environment. Their home, but now alien and hostile. No natural light exists. These children do exactly what kids would do. Hover around the TV as the only source of light and comfort. ""Can we watch something happy"" makes me tear up thing about it. Children who are a utterly powerless suddenly thrust into the domain of a malevolent entity. It made me want to throw up. I've never had a movie illicit such an emotional response from me. 10/10.",2022-11-26
"""Skinamarink"" is a film that demands your concentration, a movie that works best if you know nothing about it going in and are willing to get lost in something with strange, unsettling visual language. The film, directed by Kyle Edward Ball, is an experiment in form and storytelling, pushing viewers to stop interpreting it and experience it instead. Ball uses as many formal restrictions as a Dogme 95 filmmaker, never showing anyone's face and obscuring as much as he reveals through the use of barely-lit hallways, grainy film, and mundane domesticity. The film is shot in Ball's childhood home, which adds to the unsettling feeling of the film. The sound design is also noteworthy, with no score to alleviate the tension and remind us it's just a movie, but instead mostly consisting of music and sound bites from public-domain cartoons. This adds to the bizarre and unsettling feeling of the film.The film's pacing is slow and deliberate, drawing the viewer into the world of the film and creating a sense of unease. The acting is minimal, with the focus on the visuals and sound, but the performances given by the child actors are noteworthy. The film's themes revolve around the fear of losing one's parents and the unknown, which are both relatable and universal.In conclusion, ""Skinamarink"" is a bold and unique debut from a filmmaker who is willing to tell horror stories in a way that's both different for the genre and yet also like something we've all experienced before. The film is not for everyone, and it may be a bit too slow for some, but for those willing to give themselves over to the film's unsettling and dream-like world, it's an experience that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.",2023-01-13
"This film tries to trick you as art...Mandy (2018) with Nicholas Cage did the same thing in a way, except that film actually goes SOMEWHERE....

All those movies actually move and are creepy...this film TRICKED ME. It's awful. I feel like this is how blind people and deaf people experience movies...the angles are off, the image is dark, whats the big deal? I could've made this film on my old flip phone camera from 2008.

What am I supposed to be looking at here? What are the filmmakers trying to convey with this? Why is this in the movie? I guess that's over now and I'm look at the crown molding again. Why? Is this supposed to be a child's point of view. Does this kid walk around looking up at the top of the wall all the time? Why is it shot like this?I didn't actually finish this movie.

"This is a great concept for a short. The atmospheric quality gives it a fresh feel, but that's not nearly enough to carry it through the full 100 minutes. A plot fully comes into focus after the first hour. Before then, I was left wondering why I even drove 60 miles and sat in the theater hall watching blank screens, waiting for something (anything) to happen. I'm 48 y/o, and this was the only time I ever actually considered walking out on a movie.This was especially disappointing because I've been so looking forward to seeing this film on the big screen. The trailer was so effective in its atmospheric creepiness and glimpse of an innovative new style; a style marked with long stares down partially darkened hallways, grainy footage ala 1970's camcorders, negative space (both visual and aural), disjointed context, and disorienting contentIt was obvious that Skinamarink was going to be different.

I'm not exaggerating when I say this, but you will quite literally sit through hundreds of shots that just focus on a ceiling, wall, or floor for FAR too long.Skinamarink has MAYBE two good jump scares but that's it... to classify this as a horror movie or as some critics say ""the scariest movie of all time"" is an absolute joke.Do NOT waste your time on this snooze fest of a movie.

"This is a movie that caught my attention when the trailer was playing while I was at the Gateway Film Center. I don't normally watch them. There were things I heard when this is playing that drew my attention. When I saw that this was playing, I made it a point to check it out as I figured this wouldn't be showing long. This is one that I came in as blind as I could. I've also now given it a second watch to see how I stood with it.Synopsis: two children wake up in the middle of the night to find their father is missing and all the windows and doors in their home have vanished.Now I'll be honest, I didn't necessarily know that is what happens here. We start this off with Kevin (Lucas Paul) talking to his father, played by Ross Paul. Everyone is put to bed. Kevin and his younger sister, Kaylee (Dali Rose Tetreault), both get up. They go to a playroom that has a television and put on old cartoons.I did see that through different shots, doors and windows would disappear. There also seems to be an entity that is talking to these children, telling them what to do. If they disobey, it becomes even scarier. I should also point out that this takes place back in 1995. Kevin tries to figure out where his father and mother are, as well as what happens to his younger sister.That is where I'll leave fleshing out the synopsis a bit more and introducing to the characters that we hear. Where I should start is that this is avant-garde. The director did interesting things with the camerawork. The angles are of things that are high up or down low. Things are out of focus. We don't get the traditional seeing our characters and framing them. This is partially why it is a hard movie to talk about. It is more of an experience. This takes place late at night and is difficult to see. It also feels like they're filming this on a video camera so it is snowy as well as a bit distorted. This all adds to this odd atmosphere the movie has. It does make you think you might see something in the darkness even if there isn't.Already this is a polarizing movie as well. What makes this work for me is a bit of nostalgia. It took me back to my sister and I staying up late watching old cartoons. My dad recorded a couple of VHS tapes with them. They were always ones from before either of us were born. I'm not entirely sure how or where they were recorded from. Regardless, we would watch them over and over as we stayed up as late as could. This brings in that irrational fear of something evil being in the dark which is what I was scared of at that age.Another part that I brought up doesn't happen until late in the movie. The doors and windows disappearing early on. The kids from there just have snacks and watch television. It is as the night goes on that there seems to be a sinister entity around them. There is a dark scary voice. Kevin seems to end up isolated as well. It is a scary idea to be up by yourself. Being afraid and not being able to find your parents. Now I acknowledge, I projected these ideas on to the movie. It is something that I connected with so I can see why others who don't have this connection wouldn't like it.There is something else that I'm adding after a second watch. I need to give the crew over on Kill the Cast Podcast credit. Jerry brought up something interesting. This could be a case of child abuse. Kevin might have been hurt by his father. He also might have fallen down the stairs and is in a coma. Later into this, we get the text 'Day 572'. This dark entity could be in his head as he tries to regain consciousness. That makes this even more terrifying to me and helps explain things better as well. The disappearing doors and windows, trapping him in his own mind.Since we don't ever see our characters, it is hard to give praise to the acting. The voices of everyone is good so I'll give credit to Jaime Hill as the mom. Lucas Paul and Ross Paul as Kevin and dad respectively. Tetreault has a cute voice as the younger Kaylee as well. It was adorable.The only other things are with the filmmaking. The cinematography is interesting with what they do. I'll give credit to this. It does make it hard to give a normal narrative though. There aren't much in the way of effects but what we do seems to be done in camera. I did enjoy that. The soundtrack works for giving us diegetic. It is coming from the world of the movie mostly. There is the sound of static which is unnerving. We also get the deep, scary voice of the entity. This worked for me.In conclusion, this is a hard movie to talk about. We don't get a normal narrative. This is quite experimental. I liked it to an extent. It is uncomfortable. I also had hard time following things as well. This concept of Kevin being in a coma helped me to enjoy this more and seems to explain things for me. This is more of a movie that you need to experience. It would actually make an interesting double feature with something like Mad God. I can't recommend this to everyone though. The arthouse crowd might get something from this. I would say to give it a chance though, especially if you're intrigued.My Rating: 6.5 out of 10.",2023-02-02
"Skinamarink is a very strange movie. From the very beginning you aren't quite sure what is going on, and you keep thinking that around every corner you're going to find out, and you do find out some things, but you are very literally left in the dark for the entire film. Obviously shot on a less than shoestring budget, Skinamarink makes lack of budget and lack of everything a kind of budget. Like X it disguises itself as a film from a much earlier era. And like Blair Witch Project it uses POV as the basis for the entire film. But this is where Skinamarink is so very different. It is a POV of a small child and what we see is very little: ankles and ceilings and open or closed doors or part of the TV. You might be looking at a domed light fixture and just that while sounds happen and then the film cuts and your looking at the TV or building blocks. What the film makers manage to do is to create a claustrophobic atmosphere reminiscent of Polanski's Repulsion or something from Kubrick's early works. You don't know what you're looking at but you know something is very wrong and that is getting worse. The story, if we can call it that, of two children who wake up in a house where their parents appear and disappear and doorways and windows appear and disappear doesn't so much move forward as in a downwards spiral that we can barely understand, that we can barely see, that we can barely grasp. Skinamarink definitely isn't for everyone. It's a difficult movie to follow. But if you do, I think you'll find, as I did, a tense and moody horror film that is unlike any other horror film you've ever watched.",2023-03-02
"If you appreciate your time, your money or your intelligence, avoid this movie like the plague. It has no redeemable values and it's made specifically for people who get to scared of hearing tiny tim singing or people who gets scared by an empty room. Seriously, this would've been rejected as a homework in a film school. It only has 3 jump scares and one's a strobe light. After the first 20 straight minutes of interior establishing shots I was so done with this. It feels like a 4chan prank. It's the movie equivalent of the wall banana, except the wall banana can be actually tasty and nutritious. Nothing nutritious about skinamarink.",2023-05-17
"No movie has ever perfectly encapsulated the fear of being a child alone in a dark house with only a flickering television and cartoons to keep you safe. It's like crystalized moments of a child's trauma in real time, and something is looping back its favorite parts.Every frame and scrap of screen time, visual or audio, feed into the sense of a fear of darkness. I don't know if it was my bad tv or an intentional part of the film that the huge black spaces on my screen were edged with flames somehow within that darkness. The ADR of the children is genius, adding an additional layer of surreality and disassociation. Because we see so little of them, the lines seem to have been elicited almost organically based on how well it was delivered. Or maybe the sounds of children whispering is enough to put me on edge all on its own. Either way, it means the same to me.I watched parts of this movie through my fingers and I had to pause to grab a blanket. For a short while, I was transported back to being a frightened child.",2023-02-21
"This is one of those dreadfully awful films that only the ""cool"" people ""get it."" I see people whining ""oh man, they just don't get it - ho hum."" These are pretentious people who wouldn't know a good movie if it was laid out before them in single syllable words.It's an hour and forty minutes of shots of a wall, a ceiling, a rug, a light, a TV, all done with a cheap ""old film"" filter run over video. It doesn't look like film, it looks like a cheap ""film"" filter run over video. It also had a loud hiss that doesn't make it look like old film, it's just an annoying sound to add to a terrible ""movie"" that makes no sense. I got through 30 minutes of this mess and I'd like to kick myself in the head for wasting those 30 minutes - or even more so kick in the head the morons who said this was a great film. I started fast forwarding because I couldn't sit through shots of a house for another five minutes and it's just not worth it. It's awful - it makes Brown Bunny look like Citizen Kane. At least there was some sort of story in Brown Bunny. I assume there was a story here only because that's what some people said - the ones who want you to believe this was great when it's unwatchable.",2023-02-17
"""Skinamarink"" takes you back to the point-of-view of a child, where the house and its gaping holes and dark spaces were cavernous enough to scare you. The grainy film runs to give you something to watch at, to mark time -- it's like continually running water. The film is also for the pleasure of seeing things *being* filmed, like experimental films like Michael Snow's ""Wavelength,"" or ""Un Chien Andalou,"" or ""Meshes of the Afternoon,"" but strung forward to make for a plot and a feature-length film. It's also like the Spielberg-scripted, Tobe Hooper-directed ""Poltergeist"" in that it's looking at how items left around the house can turn on you, can have a haunted quality and make you feel trapped. And the kids' sense of self and hailing an other is really emotional and moving; just hearing them say ""Mom"" or ""Dad"" or lines like ""I got scared so I couldn't go back"" is enough to break your heart. Also, watching it from the opening credits onward is pure pleasure. This is one of the best pictures ever made. On top of that, it shows how cartoons left running around the house on a TV can have more resonance and *presence* than they were meant to -- again, it's like, in this case, the Spielberg- and Joe Dante-directed segments of ""Twilight Zone"" were run-throughs for how these things can occupy space, and chaotically spill over. You'll feel like you're in your footsie pajamas *yourself* by the end of this one -- trust me!""You need to be as small children if you want to enter the Kingdom of Heaven,"" Jesus is reputed to have said.Looks like we're already *here* ... !Amen.",2023-02-17
"(Spoiler free)This is the first feature length film I've seen to be shot in analog horror format. This movie works off the fear of the unknown, leaving you feeling unnerved for the majority of the movie. I never had a film bring me real terror, but watching this alone made me incredibly paranoid. For fans of YouTube horror classics such as Local 58 or The Mandela Catalogue, as well as fans of the creators work will want to watch this movie. That being said, if you are looking for a traditional horror movie that leaves you with a clear plot/conclusion, as well as an understanding of the plot's events, then you'll have a better time watching something else.(Minor spoilers from here on) For the best/intended movie experience, you have to give your full attention to it. This movie leaves most the plot unresolved and unexplained. This film can make seconds feel like minutes as you stare at nothing. But while nothing happens, your mind starts to become riddled with paranoia as you question what you're looking at. Giving this film your time and an open mind will pay off for people who find this content scary.",2023-02-07
"I hated this movie. It was alternatingly boring and infuriating. I would have walked out of the theater if I weren't with friends - and I've never considered walking out on a movie before. Literally nothing happens in this movie except for about six cheap jump scares accompanied with ear shattering screams or the like. By the third one I hated this movie like I've never hated a movie before. It wasn't bad in a ""so bad it's good"" way. It was bad in a ""it physically hurts and I want to leave the room"" way. I felt like a Branch Davidian being psychologically tortured by the FBI. The only tension I felt was dread for the next time my ears would be blown out. My ears are still ringing as I write this review. If the creator's goal was to make the audience feel something, then he succeeded - I feel hate. Hate hate hate hate.",2023-01-13
"In the end, I was speechless, I never thought to see a troll like this.Imagine yourself, buying you cinema ticket to watch for almost 2 hours, couches, walls and old cartoons on a tv and legos on the floor.There is no good in this movie, except if you like to waste your time.There is only ONE good scene and that's it.I get the idea behind the film, but it's too long for what it is and not enough scary (Except if lego on the floor and cartoon scare you. ).Well-done guys, this movie was a nice joke, I'm happy that I didn't see it in theatre, I would have be really mad to pay to see this film.Next time do you a favor, do a small project, before going to a long movie that you can't handle.",2023-02-14
"I was eager to watch this film as it could be an interesting and new take on horror films, but at some point of the movie, I fall sleep. It was so boring and could not really understand anything. The editing and messy plot don't help either. Maybe I am not smart enough to comprehend it... and really don't feel like giving it a second chance.I like the idea of ""experimental"" shoots and probably someone will get it right next time. The noise effects and VCR like filters are extremely well done, and could really deliver a more memorable terror experience.The movie has the ingredients to make something new and innovative, but seems like the chief needs more experience.",2023-05-22
"As is with many horror movies in this day and age, Skinamarink is a horror film that veers towards the edge of surrealism and the avant-garde. For traditional Hollywood horror fans, this trend has become very annoying for them. They want a tangible story, concrete levels of context, dialogue, and more often than not, swift pacing. Since this movie has none of these characteristics and has also been hailed as one of the scariest movies, many viewers who're fans of commercial horror films were (and still are) disappointed with Skinamarink. However, there's that brand of people who have those oddly specific fears harnessed in horrors of the unexplainable. Horrors too complex for the mind of a child. That type of creeping terror that leaves you unsure of when it might strike next. For me, I fit within that niche, and I will say that this movie scared the s**t out of me.A.",2023-01-25
"I have been leaving scores for films on here for years but never actually left a review; this film is so bad I decided it would be the first. Even when I saw what I thought was the worst film I'd ever seen, this knocked it off the top spot. I am a massive horror fan and I'm sorry but the reviews where people are saying ""true horror fans will love this"" blah blah - Don't listen because it's bull!I have to watch a film the whole way through as I don't think you can really review something fairly if you turned it off so I endured the whole being being bored out of my brains; I scrolled through Instagram, I bought some stuff off Vinted and still didn't miss a single thing because guess what?! NOTHING happens! There's pretentious and then there's THIS! I will only recommend this to people who I don't like, it's a 100% no from me!",2022-12-08
"Set in 1995 in a typical suburban home, two young children Kevin and Kaylee awaken in the middle of the night to discover their parents are gone and various windows and doors have disappeared. As the children huddle in the TV area powerless to do much of anything, more unexplained events happen around their home.Skinamarink is the directorial feature debut of Kyle Edward Ball also written by Ball and based on his short film Heck. Filmed on a crowdsourced budget of $15,000, Ball was inspired by nightmares he had as a child and through his YouTube channel Bitesized Nightmares discovered several other people had experienced similar nightmares to the ones he had experienced. The film became a minor sleeper hit making $2 million in limited theatrical engagements before eventually premiering on Shudder and also received solid critical reception, while audience reception was more polarized not unlike the divisive stances on films such as The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity. As someone who did experience similar nightmares to what's depicted in the film, I like the execution of the movie, but I don't feel like the material is substantial enough to warrant a length of 100 minutes and feel it would've worked better as a short film or a segment in a horror anthology.I will say that Skinamarink has a very distinct visual identity that helps distinguish itself, despite the film following two children as our protagonists the film mostly shows the events from first person POV shots or slanted shots from ankle level so Kaylee and Kevin are left as intentionally blank slates as to apply to any viewer's childhood nightmares without being overly specific. With the purposefully low quality audio and video I felt the film did capture the ambiance I experienced in several half remembered bad dreams where the comforts of my home were distorted by shadows and underdeveloped perception that gave fuel to the fantasies of monsters in closets or under beds. Unfortunately this leads us to a major problem with the film in that it peaks way too early (about the 45 or 50 minute mark if memory serves for me) and after that point it just keeps going and you find yourself becoming increasingly exhausted from the endless shots of the TV playing public domain cartoons or Legos scattered on the floor that I no longer felt an atmosphere of dread and was instead repeatedly checking the time because the novelty of this premise based on a blank slate child's nightmare had warn off and I felt a greater ratio of impatience rather than fear as we progressed past the halfway point.I respect Skinamarink for tapping into childhood fears and creating a surprisingly accurate reflection of nightmares I once experienced in half-forgotten flashes of childhood, but the novelty of the premise alone can't sustain the 100 minute runtime and there's not enough substance or character for the audience to remain invested for as long as the movie goes on. If you happen to have Shudder maybe it's worth a one time viewing if you were ever plagued by nightmares of the dark as a child, but for anyone else I can't really justify going out of your way to pay for a one off viewing. I will however say that Kyle Edward Ball does a good job of showing what he can produce with a shoestring budget and I'd be interested to see what he can give with actual backing behind him.",2023-02-12
"When I was at film school, I watched a lot of different types of movies. We had a semester where the theory professor focused on avant-garde and experimental filmmakers like Michael Snow, Maya Deren, Stan Brakhage, and Kenneth Anger. I say this not to try and be obnoxious but to give a sort of background regarding my feelings about the 'lack' of plot and story-there is a story here, no doubt, but it is not in any way presented in a fashion that most will have patience with. You do not see the faces of the children, you cannot hear what is being said, the camera is often aimed at the ceiling or a wall or the television or floor. Subtitles are a must.Even with this vaunted (lol no) film school background, I was frustrated and annoyed, watching the first thirty to forty minutes. Then I began to feel incredibly tense. It got worse and worse and at one point it was so bad that it was almost as though you could feel it in the room; the tension was that palpable. It was the strangest thing I've ever experienced. After the film was over, my anxiety continued to grow--really strange. I watch a lot of movies and a ton of horror. It is my favorite genre. This was a very different emotional response, nothing like the kind of 'fear' I feel when I watch my personal top ten.The fear comes, I think, from being stuck (if you decide you're going to watch all the way through to the end) in this claustrophobic, intensely unsettling place with these children. As I said about the director's short film Heck, Skinamarink has the definite possibility of bringing back uncomfortable or frightening memories of childhood you thought you'd dealt with. It's not necessarily a fun experience, but I think the film's capacity to take you right back to your worst childhood fears is so unique that it deserves points for that alone. I guess I'll just say that this movie is the horror of child abuse. If you've had those experiences then the film works pretty well. The aggressively experimental bent that feels so annoying at first slowly becomes a nightmare that works; after a while, all those angles and shadows and the slowness of it all makes you feel like a child, when dark houses are so frightening you can't recognize where you are, when time moves like molasses, and being in your parents room at night is definitely not a good place to be. I wanted it to be shorter, but I don't know that it would be as effective if it were shorter.Did I *like* it? I don't think so. I don't know. I'm still thinking about it-that's something that doesn't happen very often.",2023-05-16
"Skinamarink (2022) (READ AT YOUR OWN RISK! POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD)(8/10):How to talk about this movie,Skinamarink is a very unique film that is filmed right here in Edmonton, Alberta.It's very Arthouse and is also somewhat difficult to talk about without potentially ruining it for others.As far as in the way of plot, it's very very limited, a young four year old boy is haunted by something inside his home. There isn't much of a clear beginning,as our monitoring of the life in the household begins and then eventually,if one has enough patience they'll begin to notice that things begin to act out of the ordinary.The filming style is also very unique, it consists of various static shots of the camera being in a fixed position as they vary as the film progresses.You barely see the central character but yet that doesn't change that you still feel like the boy is in danger,as you get distorted dialogue from him throughout the film and it does a good job of making you care for someone you don't really see.Now it's a film that never really explains what is happening,it doesn't really feel like we're watching is camera footage,as in a found footage style because it has various angles that do make sense in that context.However this movie also never explains if what's happening is real or not and what it feels like is that it's stuck in some kind of twisted nightmare and after hearing that the key inspirations were people's descriptions of their night terrors,it makes perfect sense,the film seems to be trapped in a kind of limbo.However,is it scary? Yes,if you can get around the very avant garde,Arthouse style that is very different,it definitely can be legitimately scary. Once things begin happening,it then can put you in a state of constantly being on edge,as the scares are predictably unpredictable. I never felt like any of the scares were cheap as all of them played with my expectations as to when exactly it was going to come.The film is also very unnerving and as I was already a child that was afraid of the dark,of which it uses quite well to distort your view of what is happening.Now I do want to say I do like the sound design,for the most part,being as everything was distorted or sampled sound effects,there are two or three moments where I feel like the sound design was more jarring than it was intended.The movie also clearly has a small budget and it shows in some places but I found it utilized quite well for a majority of the film.It feels very much like you are right there with the young boy experiencing this surreal nightmarish experience,it's good at making you feel like it's a very personal experience,like it puts you in the childs shoes.I know it was aimed to be very experimental but it does mean that this movie can be quite divisive among movie fans as some will just think it's completely pointless and also just a bad movie,of which it's not;But I guess it could be somewhat more accessible the next time around but as for a first effort, it's pretty solid and it's best experienced in a theatre with a crowd.I do recommend it but go in with an open mind, I was really surprised by this one and I quite enjoyed it.",2023-01-15
"I understand how many people dislike this movie. It is abstract and leaves a lot to the imagination. Yes it may be long. But without the drawn out parts, the scariness and your imagination would not have time to fester.It gave me goosebumps, which i can't remember a movie doing since the og Blair witch, when i was an early teen.Just for context I'm a 30s male who loves most types of movies. I have also discovered the music album everywhere at the end of time, which I actually enjoy. So use that info to judge your own tastes.All i can say is for all these obscure random shots that a lot of people seem to dislike, it manages to convey a story/characters . Even if it is strange af. I was looking for a horror and this leaves you fearful, unlike bodies bodies bodies ( which i found absolutely horrible ) etc.I was entranced. But that was me. I hope others get to enjoy this in the same way i did.",2023-01-24
"Wtf did I waste 15 minutes watching? The most interesting thing besides the movie title were the vintage opening credits.So I guess anyone can make a movie nowdays if you just run a camera to film in the dark and have random people whispering while periodically capturing television audio and making up a synopsis of the movie. A synopsis that tells you the plot of the movie but still unable to decipher what's going on because you can't see anything. Literally no dialog but random whispers and background television audio. All this ""movie"" proves is that I'm in the wrong profession and I need to start putting out movies. Even if they don't make sense. A recording of me trying to sleep at night without my CPAP machine would be more intriguing than this nonsensical rubbish.",2023-02-02
"My biggest gripe is just how agonizingly grainy it is. I understand the director was trying to go for a 90s, old school vibe but it's SO insultingly grainy that it literally gives you a headache and at times it's practically impossible to make out what's happening on screen which is incredibly frustrating. Secondly, the movie is shot in the form of VHS cameras scattered around the house, yet at times it's revealed that these cameras also somehow function as the kids POV? This just comes across as confusing and ultimately nonsensical, not justifying the grainy element which catastrophically punctuates the movie at all. If it's cameras, why are they there and who's functioning them? If it's the kids POV, then why does it shift out of the POV seamlessly while still retaining the awful grainy effect? I know this seems like a trivial thing to complain about but for me I found it to be a distracting element because it seemingly comes across as intentional. Visuals aside (however blindingly disappointing they might be) I will conclude by saying this. Skinamarink is a painfully pretentious art house project attempting to be a horror film. The concept is very interesting and has the ingredients to be terrifying if executed by the right director. This was not the case. Any part of the movie that could have been jarring was muddied by the distracting visuals. At times the director relies on cheap, tacky jump scares or ""spoooooky"" sounds to try and force a sensation into you. Most of the movie is a long, dragging nothingness of camera clicks and door creaks and cartoons playing in the background. This could and should have been a 30 minute YouTube horror short. It felt like the director put a lot of pointless filler in just to make it long enough to constitute as a movie. Towards the end it became a David Lynch-esque garbled slush of plotless ambiguity. Another pretentious movie that offers no plot line, no explanation, no substance, just a handful of interesting still shots that would look good on an edgy 15 year olds Tumblr profile and some random still shots of nothing in particular. The kids are plagued by some demonic entity. The entity does not reveal itself or its name. We do not know what happened to Kaylee and Kevin's future is uncertain. You watch the whole movie waiting for the suspense to build towards a climax but the climax never comes which leaves the viewer feeling dissatisfied, hence all the comments of people saying they wasted 100 minutes of their lives. Best I can say about this movie is that some might find it interesting. It's not scary, I'm not even sure if it's intended to be scary, it's visually atrocious, you will not finish the movie with any more understanding of what's going on than when you started it and ultimately it's boring and heavily pretentious. Oh, and did I mention that it's pretentious?",2022-11-25
"Do you love looking at still shots of the ceilings and floors? Well I have just the perfect movie for you! Skinamarink is just 140 minutes of ceilings and floors. There's maybe a paragraph worth of dialogue that goes something like this, ""what do we do?"" ""i don't know"" and the creature saying the boys name. Repeat that like 5 times and you can create the whole movie in your head!If you told me this movie was made by a rich art school kid who dropped out because they got an F for turning this snooze fest in, I wouldn't even second guess it. I'm just so curious on how this movie was deemed suitable to be published for the public to watch, it seems more like something they would make you watch as a form of torture.",2023-04-04
"The movie is an unusual experience which will not work well with any expectations. It's a hypnosis, you go back in time and get in touch with what you are made of. You see the building blocks of your psyche, how you used to ""feel"" your surroundings before having the words to assign to them. At moments it manages to blur the illusion of time and you are in your 4 years old head and realize that maybe your current experience bled through a wormhole back then... In this movie everything is all about you, not somebody else's story.The movie can be enhanced significantly with some psychedelic support, but be careful if you have unresolved issues.",2022-12-19
"Remember when you were a child? Remember waking up in the middle of the night, staring through the crack in the door out into that hallway, where there's nothing but the oppressive darkness; remember how you thought you saw something move? Something malicious, sinister, shapeless, terrifying?That's Skinamarink.This film is not for the typical horror fan. If you favor classic slasher flicks or the occasional mainstream ""experimental"" horror piece, this is not for you. However, if you're a big fan of analog horror, liminal spaces, experimental pieces like Matthew Holness's Possum or even series such as The Mandela Catalog or Local58 on YouTube, you're going to love this.As a horror veteran and someone who seeks out artsy, experimental pieces, this is an extreme must watch and a prime example of borderline perfection in the genre. If I must critique, I would say that it is a little too slow of a build and the number of scares is minimal, but when they're done, they're done amazingly right.This film is very light on plot and characterization, rather it's an exploration into the deepest fears of our childhoods and the way it warps the mind into a state of borderline insanity. It's slow, it's hungry, it lurks like a predator, it lures us in and sits us down for 100 minutes of a child's worst nightmare come to life.Without explanation, your parents are gone, the lights won't turn on, and there's no way out. You must sit and wait for whatever it is in your home to come get you. And rest assured, it will come get you.Give Skinamarink a watch alone, headphones on, in the dark. I promise that you won't regret it.",2022-11-25
"Before we start, I love to watch different kinds of horror movies. I really took to FFF, and I love a good psychological movie that has at least some kind of paranormal undertone, or some kind of time loop, like Mine Games or something like that. So I will watch a movie that gets terrible ratings and I might love it.All that being said, I'm not entirely sure what I just watched. 90 minutes of that movie was just random shots that made no sense. Rambling thoughts and ideas that we have to watch. I will say this: I was prepared for something to happen at any moment and it only really happened once.I think it's probably one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. I like to watch movies a few times to catch things I might have missed, but this is not going to be one of those.I know the film was shot like it was the early 1990's, but it was so dark sometimes that you are staring at a blank screen. It was just a little too much sometimes. One other thing of note: Had I not read a synopsis of the movie before I saw it, I'd probably not have caught on to the fact the doors and windows were missing. I saw a toilet disappear for sure!I can't call this a horror movie or even much of a psychological thriller because it was neither of those. It was just 100 minutes of a camera shooting video of walls and doors.Be very rested when you watch this. If you are tired, you may find your head bobbing up and down and you might miss....well, nothing really. Move the end of the movie to about the 30 minute mark and re-release it.",2023-02-26
"This horror film is meant to be watched in a dark room and requires the complete attention of the viewer. If you aren't immersed into the story a sensation of tediousness will overwhelm you. At moments your mind will be tricked into doubting if something is there or not in the darkness when the camera just stays there looking into the abyss that the dark halls of the house create. This experimental horror film will play with your mind and will force you to confront the fears that you could have as a child. The fear of darkness and the unknown has been seen before in horror films but is not always that effective. The silence and occasional cartoons background music will leave you waiting for the jump scare that never comes. But once again, this is not a horror film for everyone but you will know as soon as the film starts if you will be absorbed by the darkness or if you're staying out.",2023-01-13
"It's so strange to say that there are worse films out there, but it's actually true. This movie will test your patience to the brink. Absolutely awful experience in cinema and one of the worst in history. The creator is somewhat a genius though for making it. If you are intrigued in this film, save yourself time and go to YouTube and watch a video that will do a breakdown for you. I'm sure there are a few. This one took me 3 sessions to finish. Each session worse than the last. I'm not going to even describe it because I'll just keep writing about nothing the entire time. I don't know what the rating of this film is ""18+"". If showing carpet up close at many different angles for over an hour is an R rating, well, them the mpaa rating board is getting too soft.",2023-03-03
"This started out decent and I'll admit I was curious as to could be going on. The beginning set up the movie to where I wanted to know who or what is responsible for eeriness feeling of the opening scene. The kids find themselves alone and I'm wondering like a lot o folks what's up with the house??Then it starts to fall apart and gets dull. Something is happening and while you wait to see what it is you're gonna hear some scary noises. I usually like my scary movies to have some suspense or actually be scary. As the movie begins to lag and the reveal happens slowly I kind of just wanted the whole thing to end already.This could have been a decent, original horror movie had the makers of this movie built on the opening act. It kinda felt like a lifetime movie of the week with some spooky noises and cussing for the kids.",2023-01-14
"I really like Art House movies, low-budget indies, or anything that breeds engagement over patched-in jump scares and so-sleek-they're-fake VFX. I thought I'd love the film, especially since the trailer looks like it's from 1973.Actually, the whole movie looks like that, but that's not the problem with Skinamarink. That lies wholly with the ""style"" Kyle Edward Ball chose to shoot this 100 minute ponder-fest. He has a strange gift of being able to instinctively point the camera at the exact spaces that don't interest us: On the ceiling, on the floor, on the walls, rarely if ever on any of the ""actors"".So maybe that's because Ball wants us to engage with the house, which is the malevolent force here. I guess evil really is banal. If you notice almost every so-called creepy occurrence is essentially an insert, a cutaway, an object being manipulated by someone off-screen. Yeah, I'm sure these low-budget techniques have been used before in much better movies, but the viewer shouldn't be figuring that out while watching the movie.But the lack of energy, script, character, motivation, plausibility... and on and on and on make vivid engagement with this thing virtually impossible.In the end, I wasn't sure if what I was seeing wasn't some big joke. One critic said that Skinamarink was ""what David Lynch's Poltergeist might have looked like"" --- wrong. Though Lynch shot in a very similar style with Eraserhead, that was never boring... for all the reasons I listed before. Everything Skinamarink lacks, Eraserhead had, in spades. And not much more to make it, either.I never thought I'd say this about any new movie, much less a Horror picture... it leaves too much to your imagination, to the point where after about an hour, you just want to get on to something an adult might have made.",2023-04-02
"The trailer gave reason to expect an interesting experimental playing field. Unfortunately, it turned out to be nothing but a gutless, dull and pathetic vicarious embarressment.If you don't know how to explore a limited setting in an interesting way and if you can't come up with a decent story to tell, don't try to hide your shortcomings under phony artsy framing, editing and sound design.Well-meaning advice: Watch Mr. Ball's short ""Heck"" on his YouTube-Channel Bitesized Nightmares. If the premise and execution doesn't work for you in those (already very long) 29 minutes, don't bother watching almost exactly the same thing bloated to 1 hour and 40 minutes.",2022-12-26

"I'm going to be blunt.This movie is slow, the camera angles are nauseating, the lighting is non-existant, the dialogue is strange, and the film is so grainy that you can't tell what youre looking at.And I absolutely loved it.All of these aspects of Skinamarink may be alienating to the average viewer (as evidenced by all the 1 star reviews), but, if you let yourself be absorbed- no, consumed by the film, it'll reward you with the most visceral and unsettling viewing experience that I know of.You just have to look past those difficult qualities.Yes, I'm calling them qualities because they have a purpose - You wouldn't have this movie without the slow pace and the weird cinematography, and, by conscequence, you wouldn't be able to have that same experience of pure primal dread.This movie is the universal experienece of a kid seeing things in the dark amplified and expanded. It's a reflection on that primal fear we all have.This movie makes you watch the darkness, watch the grain flicker across the screen, and asks you if you truly did see something or if it was just your mind playing tricks on you.But, if there really were no eyes in the shadows...
Why do you still feel watched?P.s. If you like this movie, read House of Leaves.",2022-11-27
"There is too much depth here. This isn't an entertaining slasher with jump scares and gore. If that's what you're into you won't like this movie.In my opinion, this is exactly what a horror movie should do. Watching this movie made me feel nostalgic in a bad way.. like a recurring dream you remember off and on and you can't escape, a creepy childhood song you can't get out of your head, words you can't express, you move too slowly and everything feels heavy and dark.. you're alone with a foreboding sense of dread. It gave a very uneasy feeling. The element of horror is perfect, but it may be too much for some.",2023-02-10
"First off, I am a major horror fan and watch lots of films that most don't ever see. This is too grainy. Too slow. Too poorly lit. Too boring. Too hard to make out audio. Too many B roll shots. This is a short story that is drawn waaaaay out. This could have been about 15 minutes and had the same plot and effect. This feels like an art school project run long.Do yourself a favor and just read up on the plot so you can save yourself some time. There are some very brief moments that are good and I applaud the writer/director for that, but we are here for the entire experience and it's just tooooo slow.",2023-01-15
"Barbarian was eh, M3gan was beyond dumb and now we have Skinamarink, which, like the other two movies listed, the internet would have you believe is the greatest horror movie ever made. Skinamarink is nothing but a horizontal Instagram reel. It's beautiful...for a little while, the same way you watch those Instagram reels on loop...for a little while. Then you move on. But this never does. It loops itself for an hour and forty minutes. The next horror movie that the internet starts buzzing about, or has a ""viral"" trailer, I'm just gonna skip. The online horror hype is just out of control these days.",2023-02-04
"If you like long, unnecessary linger shots of walls, carpets, and especially strange ones if ceilings, than this film has it all for you.Two children in a house experience something spooky.. but the audience does not. Despite a couple of jump scares that are so loud you may feel your soul leave your body, this film was so boring my friend and I wanted to shut it off.Can't speak much on any of the acting, there is very little in the way of dialogue, or story.A child falls and many interpretations are that he is dying after being put to bed, or is in a coma. The kid must have watched the movie he was in.Honestly the aesthetic was interesting in the film, but there was almost no plot, and far too many shots of walls and ceilings, almost the first 25 minutes are random shots or walls and ceilings.. I've read many pretentious reviews of this film hyping it up.Sadly it's as disappointing, if not more so, than the outwaters.The guy who made it was from my city so it's the sole reason I watched it all.",2023-05-22
"I could have made this movie with a fraction of their budget. Why? Because nothing happens. You can't see anything. No one does anything. There are children's feet sometimes. At one point there's someone sitting on the bed. Then on the other side of the bed. There's some sound effects, like TV static, bones cracking, doors shutting. There's some blood spatter at one point for some reason that was obviously edited in.No dynamic special effects, just shots of a wall with a window, then a wall without a window. I don't care what the director was trying to portray. It didn't cause some childhood dread to well up within me. It didn't evoke some sense of nostalgia.When it was over, all I felt was frustration and disappointment that the horror social media reviewers and recommendation lists I frequent implied AT ALL that this was something anyone should watch. Please, from one indie horror fanatic to another, do not watch this, don't even talk about it. If not for anything but the sake of dignity of the genre that I love.",2023-02-26
"This movie is complicated for many different reasons and for that the marketability to general audiences is going to be somewhat limited, as the meaning of this movie is meant to make you feel a level of discomfort and fear that isn't present in nearly all of media currently, but for that reason I'd argue it's beyond done its job.I'm not a fan of it myself and I was made uncomfortable throughout due to the content, but overall that's what this movie is meant to do, make you feel fear in a way that doesn't fit for what you're doing (watching a movie) and in that you're scared for 2 kids on a movie screen and have it feel far more genuine than anything else done today, this is a clear and defining piece of cinema that needs accolades.But again, not for everyone, you will be uncomfortable when watching this and you are going to feel afraid at points, but you're meant to, this is a movie that's redefining the Horror Genre to again make the audience afraid.",2023-02-02
"...that cannot sustain itself over 1:40. The director/editor could have easily cut 20 minutes out and still had the same film. I'm all for experimental cinema, but experimentation has to leave open the possibility of failure, and ultimately that's what Skinnamarink is, unfortunately. I respect the director's vision - the film was borne out of a series of shorts he made based on the dreams/nightmares of others, but that is best suited for a shorter format. Other experimental horror films - notably The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity - have a sense of rising action, but the tempo of this film never changes.",2023-03-19
"Kyle Edward Ball's writing and directing debut isn't a film about A24 or Blumhouse-styled shock scares and CGI poltergeists. It's a Dogma 95 homage.The roots of that avant-garde filmmaking movement (1995 to 2005), founded by Danish filmmaker Lars von Treir (Breaking the Waves, Dancer in the Dark), has its roots in the French New Wave: a late 1950s art film movement using mise-en-scene aesthetics spearheaded by Francois Truffaut (400 Blows) that included Jean-Luc Godard (Breathless) and Claude Chabrol (La Femme infidele). The basics of the Dogma 95 manifesto: Shooting must be done on location and only props original to the location can be used. If a prop is required for narrative, the location of that prop must be used. All cameras must be handheld with no filters or optical effects. When setting down a camera: use only available surfaces. Only use available light sources.Today, 21st century film studios eschew hard media DVDs for free-with-ads stream distribution platforms; courtesy of the advances in DSLR cameras, such as the Canon EOS series (Canon Reds), more ""pure"" films -- both shorts and features -- that shun special effects and post-production techniques now stream. While (the now mainstream with Oasis/EFO Films) shot-on-iPhone trailblazer James Cullen Bressack is not part of this unofficial rebirth of the Dogma-French New Wave movement (he shot the first commerically-released SOP film, 2013's to Jennifer), iPhones are now also being used to create films with an analogous structure and tone: films that demand you keep your hands out of the popcorn tub and pay attention. And films in either of those genres can be -- for the mainstream-bred film goer -- an admittedly hard watch.In the case of the $15,000-shot Skinamarink in Ball's childhood home: the hard watch comes at the viewer in a 100-minute running time; so even though Ball has created a story that excites in its effort to eschew those, now overused, A24 and Blumhouse horror story objective-conventions, the admittedly minimalist story would exceeded, more so, if its narrative tightened to an 80-minute (one hour twenty-minutes) running time (easily done with less-long lingering shots). While this is not a found-footage effort (itself Dogmaesque at times), remember how The Blair Witch Project (1999) seemed it would never end; when the POVs of Paranormal Activity (2007) and Cloverfield (2008) led to frustration?The Edmonton, Alberta-shot Skinamarink began with a proof-of-concept short Heck, itself an outgrowth of Kyle Edward Ball's Bitesized Nightmares You Tube channel where he crafted streaming shorts based on the nightmares of the channel's commenters. Skinamarink concerns two children (based on Ball and his sister) who wake up in the middle of the night to find their father missing -- and all of the windows and doors in their home have vanished.Beyond that explanation provided by the digital press kit, the rest is up to the viewer. Are the kids actually awake or are they in a dream-within-a-dream state? Is that odd shadow just a play of the light in the dark or a person casting the shadow -- shadows that lend to the ominous soundscapes of the now window-and-doorless house? Oh, and at no time is anyone's face shown on screen. The film isn't so much lit as it is darkened, with scenes lit by a television's glow that reveals glimpses of someone in the frame. And instead of dialog we get a subjective, dreamlike soundscape of dark noise that only the dark can bring to a child's ears.Joshua Reale's underground, somewhat analogous debut, Necropath (2021), comes to mind: a zombie movie that wasn't meant for the traditional George Romero or Lucio Fulci connoisseur. Reale, as Kyle Edward Ball, works -- in a non-traditional minimalist narrative -- a Bigas Luna surrealism crossed with Alejandro Jodoroswky's impressionism style. This is a film, a style of sight, color, and sound (sounds, more so) that pushes the visual medium envelope of film; an art form that, at its core, is a craft based in ""showing"" and not ""telling."" This is a netherworld were Kyle Edward Ball expertly adheres to the ""90% visual and 10% dialog"" rulebook of film. He's created a stellar debut that is definitely not a one-and-done flash in the pan work.",2023-01-26
"If so, you'll love this movie. The camera angles are framed on either the ceiling or the floor almost every second of the entire movie. They only direct the camera reasonably in a few extremely short moments. The rest of the time you will be looking at the corner where the wall meets the ceiling or the floor, or maybe the edge of the TV where papers or legos are spread out, or under the couch so you can see only the feet of the two children and a part of the TV.Don't be confused by any good ratings. It is unbearably boring. There are a couple of surprises, but they aren't worth the other 90 minutes of time you will waste.The children they hired for this cannot even speak coherent lines, so they subtitled the film whenever they were supposed to speak. A total of around ten lines in the entire film. The father has one line at the beginning of the film.Then there are the very few moments where something is actually happening, they announce these with digital sounds like an original episode of Star Trek. In other words, annoying hums and beeps.Otherwise, pretty much the only sounds you hear are a TV's static, a VCR, dialing on a telephone, a tape player playing a child's storybook, and a cartoon that the children keep playing over and over again on the TV.Don't waste your time. I have watched hundreds of bad horror films and I would consider this the absolute worst one ever. It wasn't scary. It wasn't performed well. It didn't have decent audio. It had horrible framing. It has the worst grit/static throughout the film. Just absolutely disgusting in every single way.",2023-08-17
"I see that some people appreciate the artsy aspects of this film, like the long static shot of the top of a lamp and the ceiling while we hear one side of a dull telephone call, or a long static shot of a night light and the floor while we hear nothing at all. The director seemed to really enjoy high shots - the top of a doorway and the ceiling, almost all the shots are what we would call unbalanced screen forces and little audio. It takes 27 minutes of atmospheric, grainy, dark, visuals before the plot even starts. And it starts slowly...very slowly. It makes liberal use of old cartoons and their campy audio. The characters whisper so there are subtitles, I assume to make it more mysterious. All of this is decidedly creepy, I get it, but it's trying way too hard to defy conventions for no apparent cinematic reason. Look at my film, see how cool I am?! I say pretentious BS.",2023-02-05
"How do you review a movie that at it's core isn't a movie? I don't know. I realize that the first sentence doesn't make a lot of sense but it is true. This movie isn't really a movie. Skinnamarink is a collection of oddly framed images, oddly lit and edited together in a manner that seems disturbing. It is the kind of artsy nonsense that I usually hate, but for some reason I don't hate this. I DO hate the audio, which is so bad we need subtitles even though the characters are speaking English, when they speak at all. This is a film that starts and ends nowhere. There is no narrative in the traditional sense but we are able to surmise there has been an accident. That's all. If you're looking for a nice tidy explanation you won't get it here. You honestly don't get much at all here. Yet, somehow, I did not totally hate it. It is the mist divisive film in years and I totally get why. I SHOULD hate this, yet I don't. Maybe it will take another watch.",2023-02-17
"I can totally see why this wouldn't appeal to some people, but I think the reviews that say nothing happens are unfair. Quite a bit happens, and there are some genuinely creepy scenes and sights and I felt tense and it got to me.I grew up in the 90s and I still own the same VHS tape that the kids are watching (The Cobweb Hotel is a 1936 cartoon and yet for some reason it was clearly prominent in kids lives in the 90s!) in the film which added something for me! It tapped into some genuine childhood fears I had. My parents going missing and something lurking in the darkness were certainly high up on my list of the most horrifying things.I'm not one of those people that needs things neatly tied up for me. I'm quite happy with a bit of obscurity and some things left up to my own imagination and left for me to decipher, but I get that not everyone appreciates that either.",2023-02-26
"How bad is 2022's Skinamarink? Let me put it this way, how bad is SARS? I'm thinking pretty bad. When you watch Skinamarink, you wonder how anyone let alone a studio head could greenlight this thing. I mean did they lose a bet to the film's directors (Kyle Edward Ball, Kyle Ball)? Probably. I can't see any other way.So yeah, Skinamarink might be the most frustrating movie I've ever seen. Why? Because it has intentions yet is miscalculated to the nth degree. The Balls made Skinamarink and forgot that someone might actually see their creation that looks as if it was fashioned in the late 60s or early 70s. The flick is so grainy you'd think an assistant accidentally poured sawdust in the lens. Basically Skinamarink is a 100-minute gimmick that is not meant to entertain but to impart to. Count me out after one viewing.Contrivances aside, Skinamarink's premise is there for the taking. It's about two kids who wake up to find a family member missing with all the doors and windows gone from their house. Rather than go the straight-forward route with a stout thriller, the Balls decide to do an arthouse version of Paranormal Activity instead. Why? Why?!!The whole thing is a shaggy-dog story and a mind-numbing bore, all slow burned, disjointed, and prepped for the snooty crowd. Um, you know this pic is bad when the stuff on the TV in Skinamarink is more interesting than what's actually projected onto the viewer. I mean at least you know what's going on with those kooky cartoons.In Skinamarink, there are actors who are never seen, dialogue exchanges that never occur (with characters only having random thoughts), subtitles for something in English (wha??), scenes that are cut feverishly with no connection from point A to B, and a title that has no attested meaning. Yup, it all adds up to bunk. ""Skin don't gotta have it"".",2023-02-03
"Skinamarink (2022) is an Indie film with a $15k budget that was my Friday the 13th main feature that I caught at the Alamo Drafthouse last night in a limited release (should be coming to Shudder soon). The Canadian horror movie had a storyline that follows two children under six who wake up in a house and their parents are gone and the windows and doors are missing...how is this possible and who or what is inside with them?This movie was written and directed by Kyle Edward Ball in his directorial debut and stars Jaime Hill (Grotesque), Ross Paul (Moby Dick) and Dali Rose Tetreault.This is an extremely unique addition to the horror genre that felt both ""artsy"" and low budget at the same time. The storyline has a great premise and a lot of potential. The use of camera angles and lighting was good but a bit overdone. The props and cartoon was awesome and their ability to create subtle eerie horror elements was smart. This is definitely a movie you need to watch in a dark room with the lights off. There are some tremendous cartoon in this; and in all honesty, I could watch the cartoons on the television set all day (they were playing the movie theatre before the previews and were awesome). The dialogue is purposely faint and simple to slowly increase intensity and gets better and better as the film unfolds. The end was solid but I think they could have taken it a step further.Overall, this movie isn't for everyone but it is worth viewing once. You will either appreciate it or hate it. I would score this a 6/10 and recommend seeing it once.",2023-01-14
"Not even a movie. Just a camera pointed at random places in a house for 2 hours with random clips of ""spooky"" poorly recorded dialogue like a kid saying ""I don't want to go upstairs"". There's no plot, there's no story. Anyone with an iPhone and a film grain filter could make this as it requires zero creativity.It reminds me of that time a man accidentally left his glasses on the floor at a modern art show and when he came back to get them, people were taking photographs and discussing the glasses, thinking it was part of the art exhibit and thus had some deeper meaning.You keep thinking maybe something will happen. Maybe there's a payoff for you sitting watching grainy film of some random house with cartoons playing in the background. But there never is, and they already got your money.I've been more impressed by things I've seen in my toilet.",2023-04-05
"The movie itself breaks several of the molds of horror films and does so in a very interesting way, The protagonists of the movie are a set of young children who are dealing with the sudden dissapearance of their father and an encroaching darkness. All around brilliant film full of intellect and intrigue. It struggles a bit to stick the landing but very very happy i watched it in the end!Without giving too much away the filmmake works with an almost unbealivably small budget and delivers a film that feels full of dread and terror. The audio was crafted with intention and many smart decisions were made in the voice acting that left scared but wanting more.The choice of small children as protagonists makes the tension that much thicker, plus its clear that the filming did not put any strain or pressure on the young preformers which is a personal best for me.If you like smart horror with intention you will love this! A bit of a slow burn but very worth it!",2022-11-27
"I really wanted to love this movie with all my heart but I have to face the reality. It's unwatchable and probably the most boring experience Ive had so far. Can't believe I was patient enough to go through the whole film. Some mumbling, bad lit scenes that makes no sense whatsoever. There's definetely a creative look and the sureal image gives it a very unique creepy touch but there's no script, nothing to save, just pure boredom. Dont have much to say, it was just terrible and I wouldnt recommend this to anyone. I think the trailer is enough to give you a full experience of this film if not better. Damn that was a letdown.",2023-01-21
"Basically, No plot, no... ANYTHING. ITS NOT ""horror"" because it is not scary, it's not even mildly interesting. I was told by a coworker that this was, and I quote, ""such an awesome movie"". Well, (spoiler alert) grainy film of ceilings, floors and corners is far from ""awesome"". You never even see the characters, except from the knees down. I wasted an hour and forty minutes waiting for the movie to start. It never did. Random instances of toys being tossed and moved around, and a ""now you see it, now you don't toilet"", were just that; random and completely meaningless. THERE IS NO STORY HERE! I highly question the intellect of the coworker who said it was ""awesome"". I would highly recommend you skip this one completely... I wish I had.",2023-08-15

I got trolled.The movie started okay only because it looked like something bad was going to happen.After 10 min, nothing happened.After 20 min, nothing happened.At 30 min, it became a torture to continue to watch this terrible home video...literally just shooting home. Maybe re-arrange furniture between cuts.This movie made me and my friend think that we could also make the movie....and better than this.Dont waste your time on this movie.",2023-01-28
"This movie was an outstanding example of how childhood trauma tends to mess with one's mind. The imagery and sounds were a perfect blend of what it feels like to experience a traumatic head injury. However, one thing keeps me from giving this film the ten star rating it deserves. Prominently displayed throughout the movie is the orange Lego Brick Separator part number 630. While there was a model of brick separator present in 1995, this iteration did not grace the world until 2012, long after the child would have died from head trauma. This oversight makes the film unwatchable. Terrible movie.",2023-02-28
Super dreadful movie to watch thru all the way. They could have had the same effect in a short 15 minute movie. I stared at a wall and light for some of the movie. Audio sounded like a 1990s VHS and could barely hear the dialogue. One man spoke on the phone and it was the most bass I have ever heard out of my speakers. Barely able to finish the movie. I read the comments and still think they gotta be trolling with everyone. Barely anyone is on the screen. I honestly think you could use an iPhone and get a better video and audio. I don't see how anyone at all thought this was a good video to watch.,2022-12-28
"Why do I say that? Because blind people would get just as much out of watching this film as those with sight. This is an hour and forty minutes of staring at walls, ceilings, black screens, rugs, toys, and the occasional old cartoon.The cast is virtually unseen in this movie, and when they appear on screen, it's usually just from the knees down. The sound is so bad you have to watch it with subtitles on just to have a clue of what's being said or what the sounds are.Nothing happens in this movie. You get some brief shots near the end that suggest something bad happened but the rest can only be inferred, as you hardly see any of the characters, much less anything else. Oh no, they're somehow on the ceiling... this is supposed to be scary? People compared this to Poltergeist? Where is the horror here? It's just voices whispering - and almost unintelligibly if you don't have subtitles on.I've watched tons of horror movies and this is by far the worst. It's a total waste of time. Forget a 20 minute short, this couldn't fill a 5 minute short. It's empty... it lacks plot, it lacks characters, it lacks tension, scares, or anything of the sort.",2023-08-04
"It looks like a 60's budget grainy movie filled with annoying sound effects reminiscent of nails on a chalkboard. There is no story, there are no actors shown just weird dark camera angles showing nothing or Lego pieces. If you don't have subtitles you won't know what any of the dialogue is. Don't know if they are trying for a Blair Witch type of film but they truly failed. I only watched it through as my daughter wanted to watch. I have no idea what the point of this is or how it got out to the public to watch just to be filled with disappointment and bewilderment. I put as doesn't give away spoilers as nothing happens in this movie.",2023-02-22
"I never write reviews but I'm from Edmonton and we can produce so much better. Maybe you can call this ""artsy"" if you're an 80 year old with Alzheimer's.Watching a fly on a wall would be more exciting. Oh wait, that's exactly what I watched. It really is a an hour and 40 minutes of a whole bunch of nothing, like why did you stretch it out that much and forced us to go through the biggest minimalist film.There was no execution. It's like watching the beginning of a movie where the first 2 minutes sets the tone but it's an entire movie. It's like if a single blink lasted an hour and 40 minutes.",2023-03-07
"I can definitely understand why so many didn't like this, it really isn't for everyone. There are many Long drawn out shots of corners and shadows. You don't ever really see anyone's face or see them straight on for a fact. Most of the audio is whispered words and static. That being said this is all deliberately done, obviously. Very much an experimental horror film, a unique one at that, that's played out like a nightmarish fever. If you're like me and have a deep fear of the dark, you may be pleasantly surprised. I kept making out faces and outlines in the shadows that I'm not entirely sure were really there. It stuck with me the rest of the night. I feel like the ending was ambiguous and honestly there was no better way. Like I said definitely NOT for everyone but give it a shot you might be pleasantly surprised.",2023-02-17
"You get this ungodly boring abomination of a movie.If there is a purgatory I believe this is what it is like.I went into the movie blind so I had no expectations, it starts off interesting and unique in the way it is filmed but you could tell right away that this was gonna be a slow one.I just could not predict how extremely slow, boring and amazingly drawn out it would be.The movie would have been good as a maybe MAX 5min short just to showcase the aethetic of the film, but the movie unfortunately spanned to a 100 minutes and it felt like you had a TikTok on repeat for that entire time, almost nothing happens and the ending leaves you with regret that you spend time watching this movie.This does not surprise me since the director comes from a background of making hour long ""horror ASMR"" videos on YouTube which I imagine is just as boring.Do yourself a favor and do not watch this film, do anything else but watch this film, it is on another level of boring beyond human understanding.",2023-04-06
"So clever, leak it onto social media, pay influencers to say how scary and amazing it was and then wait for the sheep with their FOMO to follow the flock.Will this have the same impact as Blair Witch or Eraserhead in 10 years time?...no.I thought I would struggle to find a more pretentious horror than Men, but this blew it out of the water.Shot with a £9000 budget and as it stands making £1.5m at the box office it has been extremely successful and the marketing has worked. This would be ok if trimmed to 10 minutes and directed by a 16 year old for a school project, but it's not.A labouring 90 minutes spent watching carpet, walls, doors, cartoons on TV...oh and Lego pieces. This was marketed as a horror. Was I one bit frightened...no, Did I care about the characters...no. I didn't pay to watch this, but still felt cheated.8/10 for marketing
0/10 for the movie.",2023-02-07
"I went in only knowing the plot and that it was filmed weird. It's definitely experimental filming that more closely resembles the mandela effect catalogue rather than another movie. It's starts off unsettling right away, the house is super dark and it's hard to see fully what's going on. You never see their faces except for maybe a couple of shots. You either see their feet, their back or just what's around them which i honestly really liked. The camera was grainy and felt like you're watching a semi old video tape. The acting from the kids was honestly really good, you could feel the fear/curiosity/ confusion every time they spoke like it was actually happening to them.Now for some spoilersi think it was pretty apparent once everything went down that these kids would not have a happy ending. The whole time you're wondering how exactly they would die and although they don't they were met with a fate worse than death. Forever trapped in the house by the bored demon that found them. Kevin dying over and over again while he cries for his mom and kaylee blind and unable to speak because the demon removed these features. The last shot is burned into my mind, the ugly blurry face just staring into the camera as the kids ask who it is. You can take the movie how you want to take it. I personally see it as two ways although any interpretation is plausible.1. it's simply a bored demon with reality warping abilities that stumbled across two kids and they are forever trapped with it until it gets bored again.2. child abuse/dream.At the beginning of the movie kevin falls down the stairs and hits his head. I believe he's still knocked out and dreaming about how he views his mother and his family's situation. The house representing how trapped he and his sister are when dad is away and mom is home. The father and mother are going through a divorce. Kevin tried bringing up his mom and kaylee shuts him down saying she doesn't wanna talk about her. The demon calls kaylee upstairs while kevin is sleeping and takes the form of mom. She's facing away and tells kaylee her and dad love them very much. I think kevin views his mom as a monster that he and his sister are trapped with while dad is away. They just stay downstairs while mom is upstairs, kaylee trying her best to protect him until she is silenced for not listening to the demon. Eventually kevin is killed over and over again by the demon all while crying out for his mommy. I think rather than crying out to mom he's crying for mom to stop hurting him. The whole time the demon is talking to kevin he's nervous, tries to ignore it at first and then does whatever it says.Sorry for any spelling errors and if i didn't make sense at times, it's very late right now and i couldn't stop thinking about the movie.",2022-11-26
"Look, I'm a horror fan and can appreciate just about anything you throw at me. Big budget, no budget - it doesn't matter. But what was the point of this?Its not a movie in any sense of the word. More like a showreel for a director/camera operator to demonstrate they know how to create tension and unease. Bravo.You get my vote for being able to do all that but the actual experience from the audrience's perspective is that this was mind-numbing drivel. Many of the official reviews described this as ""terrifying"". Seriously?It plays like a spectacularly over-long film school assignment.

You will probably either love it or find it really confusing-like me. First of all, Skinamarink is the name of a popular sing_a_long song for kids in Canada. The whole movie is shot in a fuzzy lens-I guess to be scary-and the actors are seldom even seen. Mostly, just their feet are shown. Jaime and Ross are the parents of Lucas and Dali and it's mentioned that it takes place in 1995. Lucas and Dali wake up one morning and find that they are alone in the house. They look for their parents but can not find them. Lots of things will disappear and flicker a bit and then reappear-doors, windows, toilets, etc. There are lots of shots of the interior of the house with nothing going on-I kept expecting to see something.....but nothing would happen. Lots of shots of kids' Lego toys and other toys scattered on the floor. The tv comes on and off by itself and has cartoons playing. Sometimes a voice is heard-I don't know whose-suggesting that the kids do something but they are usually not shown doing anything, just heard. There is blood on the floor and wall at one point but it flickers between being there and disappearing. The credits are at the beginning and when the movie is over, it just says The End and goes blank, without anymore credits. Like I said, it's a weird movie.It is rated NR and has violence-I think-and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD. I don't know if it would be a good one to stream, either. If you really want to see it, I'd wait until it comes to tv.",2023-01-22
"This film is going to be a hit or miss for people. Either it is going to speak to you or it is not. A lot of people will find the film very different and have probably never seen anything quite like it, but those who have seen any number of analog horror films on Youtube will be more familiar with this style. Me, I fall in the middle as I read the premise and was like ""a weird supernatural horror...I'm in!"", but then I start watching it and I am like ""I am having a hard time following this..."" Granted, I do believe I know what has happened and watching the Film Theorist, he too, came to the same conclusion and even filled in the gaps when I thought my theory did not explain certain aspects. It was interesting and it was better than any Paranormal Activity film, but it needed more. More dialog, more normality and a more distinct ending.The story starts right off with the wacky camera angles and the whole strange look of said film. This is where normality should have been placed. I am like, ""is the house already messed up?"" and it was hard to figure out the lines of when things were normal in the house and not normal anymore. I think it would have been more jarring if the film had been normal looking and then just went to full fledged nightmare. Anyways, Kevin falls down the stairs and then at some point he and his sister Kaylee are stuck in the house as their parents are missing and the doors and windows are gone! They are stuck, but they seem to take it right in stride which made no sense to me. Things are going berserk in their house as things vanish and the only sound is from the television playing public domain cartoons which made me wish the evil entity would take the television away!The stars are virtually never on camera other than a glimpse here and there. I wish they would have gotten two kids with less similar voices because at times I had no idea who was talking. It was also hard distinguishing whose perspective I was seeing the film through which made it more disorienting as I am trying to find some meaning in the film. However, this may have been intended as this is kind of an experimental film.So, while I enjoyed aspects of the film, I thought it was just so difficult to watch due to it being stylized to be as hard to watch as possible. The whole thing centers around children's dreams so I am guessing older movie goers will be less impressed with this as their childhood dreams have faded while the younger the viewer the more vividly they still remember their childhood nightmares. Which is what this film is, a child's nightmare come to life and in some ways it works, but in other ways it fails...it needs to be a bit more accessible to viewers. As it is, it is a polarizing film which you will either hate/love/or be right in the middle and it's score here indicates that.",2023-03-14
"Unlit scenes, grainy images and disembodied voices does not a horror movie make. How many times do I need to see shots of Legos on the carpet and every imaginable weird camera angle covering a house? This movie cost 15 grand? Maybe $5 grand and few PB& J sandwiches.He should have done it with no actors since we can't see them anyway. He could have done all the voices himself.I sat through it hoping something would happen. And even if something happened you can't see it. The director counts on his audience to fill in the blanks and boy is there a ton of blanksThis outing doesn't show writing creativity or directing ability. It is literally all conceptual.I just can't tell if it low concept disguising itself as high concept or actually high concept.",2022-12-08
"Dull, the trailer was better put together & was more interesting.The idea of inky darkness in a house at night & imagination parsing outshapes is interesting, but not enough for a feature film in my opinion.The director spun this out for an hour and 40 mins?Giving 2 stars for the grainy liminal aesthetic, & what I'm assuming was the overall trolling behind the film.Really felt like a long con & ran out of suspense gas too early (20 minutes in when I realised it was mostly going to be shots of the house only).Admittedly, at points tried to engage my imagination a bit, but then realised my mind was just wandering & I started thinking of what else I could be doing with my time.Some retrowave horror genre cliche attempts at scares that felt very stale.Art gallery fodder. Disappointing.",2023-02-05
"I have never agreed with every criticism of a movie and said ""yeah I know it's great tho right?"" Yes it was too long by like 80 min. Yes it was so so slow and weird and nonsensical.It's such an intentionally made film. I truly feel that the writer/director showed us the exact images in their head. This is what my nightmares look like.I was tense for the entire time even though there is virtually no action or plot, it's truly a vibes film that isn't for everyone.There were moments that I found deeply and fundamentally scared. Outstanding movie.If you're into Lynch's work this should be up your alley.",2023-02-12
"Alright, first of all, I watched it how you should. Lights off, headphones on. Second, I am trying to rate this fairly. Some of the one star reviews are saying ""literally nothing happens!"" That is blatantly not true - don't exaggerate just because you didn't like it.First, I did like the graininess and the sounds. That is why I gave it a couple stars. That said...While things certainly happen, not a LOT happens. The movie gives you SOME subtitles, but some of the audio you flat out couldn't understand. I know people are complaining about way too many still shots of corners, of legos, of a wall, etc. They are correct.Some of the people raving about this movie swear you just have to ""go back to when you were 4 or 5, and woke up in the middle of the night from a nightmare..."" Okay, I was a kid once, I had nightmares, and I watched this movie in the setting I was supposed to. The only things that got me were the jump scares, and for obvious, cheap reasons. This movie has some voice telling Kevin to put a knife in his eye, what do you mean go back to your childhood and this will really scare you? What kind of childhood did you have?The director has a plot for this movie, I believe. And the reason why I hate these subjective type movies is because I know there most likely is a correct answer, but now all the artsy fartsy people are running wild. One explanation I saw was that Kevin, after falling down the stairs, went into a coma and this was all a dream. Another was that this is all about child abuse (sexually) although this doesn't make sense because the girl was punished via disappearing mouth for ASKING FOR her mom and dad, who in the plot description are not even there.This just seems like some weird video you put on in the background under some goth club music. Maybe the director was onto something when this was a short film, because an awful lot of people, even those who loved the movie, say it is too long. Why did the parents disappear then show up then disappear? Why was the toilet glitching in and out of existence? Was the movie implying Kevin (and his sister that just disappeared) was in that house for over 500 days? No family, not even the rich and famous, have that amount of groceries, and based on the house, they aren't preppers. The bathroom would make Kevin physically sick. And this demon thing doesn't actually plan to kill Kevin, keeping him around that long?I can suspend disbelief - I love horror and do so often. But at least have SOME, ANY sort of rules or something solid to stand on. I will sit through the entire movie no matter how godawful the movie is. This is one of the few movies that just seemed to drag on and on.I really don't think I will be watching this again.",2023-03-02
I kept hearing how this was the best horror movie ever and it was praised by the reviews. After watching however i realized this was the worst possible movie i have ever watched. There were only a few bad reviews and sadly i did not listen to them. Everyone was saying that it's a slow movie and you have to be patient but there is no plot whatsoever. You can barely call this a movie. Everything is left to interpretation and 98% of the time the camera is pointed to either a wall or a tv. You keep watching thinking something will finally happen but nothing ever does. Please save your time and watch another movie. This was unbearable to watch and i still have no idea why i watched the full movie.,2022-11-29
"Happy new year! This is the first film I watched in 2023.In (most) Horror movies, what makes us scared is the expectation that something will pop up. Our fear of jumpscare. The build-up. And Skinamarink is a movie that is basically built on that principle. 99% of the movie is just us looking at empty rooms, ceilings, doors, or just complete dark, black screen. But it is tense and scary. It works because that principle is utilized well. You can't not use jumpscare at all, it would be a nothing movie. You can't overuse them either, the movie would lose all tension. And I think this movie did a decent job of balancing those things.But there are two things I want to point out. Firstly this film is kinda disposable? When you know when the scares are gonna happen, rewatching this would lose all the tension. The aesthetic and atmosphere are impressive, but that isn't enough to rewatch the whole thing. Secondly, you need to be in a darkness watching this. I watched this alone in my room with all the lights off. Otherwise I don't think this movie would have been scary. (Other reviews have pointed this out too)So this is a movie that has clear strengths and weaknesses, but I'd say it made me cover my eyes in many scenes. There are legit creative scares and memorable stuff here.",2022-12-31
"I marked this as a spoiler free review. In fact, you can't spoil something with no plot. But I will spoil it by accurately describing it. This is an overlong, underlit boring film experiment being passed off as as a horror movie.Now, in all honesty, horrible kind of sounds like horror so maybe that was goal? If so, mission accomplished.My understanding is that the filmmaker did online content around viewers nightmares and that's what this picture is about. But who wants to see other people's dreams? Even the unpleasant ones? Its not interesting. Its not entertaining. Its just an endless series of images with little reason and certainly no rhyme.",2023-02-02
"Skinamarink is a portal to another realm, a direly creative vision that really is as much of an experience as it is a film. It can be frustratingly hard to follow and downright boring at points but coalesces into something remarkable, a haunting, enduring memory that starts to sink in after the fact. Watching Skinamarink is an investment as it isn't so much about the actual viewing of it as it is the feelings and echoes it leaves.The film follows two very young children trapped in a surreal nightmare of a dark, desolate home, looping cartoons, stray Lego blocks, and cruel voices in the shadows. It plays like a perversion of found footage, as if a college art course possessed Paranormal Activity. There are many long, abstractly framed shots of indecipherable doorways and dimly lit objects, punctuated by jump scares or disturbing developments.Skinamarink is ambitious, thought-provoking, and challenging, but by the same token it can be dull and hard to watch. The mileage will vary incalculably from viewer to viewer, predetermined by one's appetite for the stylings of abstract art. For all intents and purposes, there is no plot, story structure, dialogue, or characters. It won't work for everybody but for those it speaks to, it's a whole new language of horror.",2023-02-20
"I love horror films. Always have. Always will. I just watched Skinamarink, in the dark, at night, with headphones, as recommended to give it the best opportunity. It is now the most pretentious, waste of time, try hard, ""elevated"" horror film I've ever witnessed.Those that like the film will tell me that I don't ""get"" it. I get it. It's supposed to be the embodiment of childhood fear and trauma. A child's nightmare. OR the kid got a concussion falling down the stairs, or was abused, and this is what his brain is doing.If you're OVERLY curious and just want to give it a fair chance like I did, get it out of the way as a watch. Otherwise, it's what almost everyone has said: an hour and forty minutes of dark, grainy footage of toys, ceilings, carpets, doorways, and an over exposed television, that you can never get back. An hour and thirty three minute jumpscare with a Fisher Price Telephone and a creepy internet gif from fifteen years ago.",2023-02-15
"This movie was actually pretty horrific. Don't view it through the lense of modern horror that has constant action and jump scares because you will be disappointed. I put myself inside the 4 year old, and was pretty freaked out the whole movie once I got in the groove. It was particularly unnerving and creepy, and it left me pondering long after viewing. I was looking for meaning into what had just happened to my mind so proceeded to Google the movie. I found the director has a YouTube channel where he turns people's nightmares in short horror. He also has a skinamarink-esque short called Heck. Highly recommend checking these out.",2022-10-30

That's how my wife and I responded to this. Honestly, we were done with it about ten minutes in but finished it because my daughter liked it. It's entirely unlike any film I've ever recalled her enjoying!The film is frightening in how dull it is. You can barely understand the kids. They subtitle some lines but others they don't. Other than the fact the kids are in danger there's nothing emotionally tethering a person to this film. You never fully see their faces. You never learn what is going on. And most of the shots are static containing ceilings, walls, and the tv.As an experimental film, this one failed to produce results.",2023-01-23

By the end, yeah, it was slightly mesmerizing. In an accidental sort of way. But, oh dear lord, as a movie this emperor has no clothes. Listen to me. After a hundred minutes, I was worse than angry and bored. I was just. . .nothing.The themes were good. Really good, in fact.

"I decided to watch this movie after watching a TikTok creator recommend it. My best advice when following the recommendation of TikTok creators is this; do not follow the advice of TikTok creators. I'm fairly confident that if given a camera in the time, my ninth grade, daughter and her friends would've made a scarier movie. I am ready when they can complete a film so I give two stars just for the completion.But you have some movies look like an art film? And I don't mean that like in a good way? This movie looked like something they have been put together in a rush to meet some sort of a deadline. It's hard to sympathize with these characters when you never see them. I mean you literally never see them. And what's terrorizing them? Is it a demon? Is it an alien? Is it a ghost? We never know.

"I didn't like it that much. My complaints are pretty much the same as everyone else who rated it low: there's not enough content for a full length movie, static shots last too long, too much repetition, and there is too much time between moments when something happens. It's not that it's a slow burn; it just plain wastes time. There are some sequences that could have been pretty creepy, but it just ended up tedious. It is very experimental and open-ended, which is another feature that always divides audiences. I sometimes don't mind when a movie is challenging to watch, as long as I feel like the filmmaker had a reason for everything he put on screen. I felt like this director didn't fully plan his story out and had to find ways to fill time.",2023-01-24
"This is an incredibly polarizing movie and not just with the average horror lover but even more so with mainstream audiences.I think if you don't know or like the ""Analog"" sub genre that's predominantly big on YouTube, then I totally understand 90% of the ""wasted my time/boring"" responses to this film. Including the critiques of everything being barely visible or blurry. It's part of the charm, for lack of a better word. It's a niche thing that can either be done really well like The Mandela Catalogue by Alex Kister, or Local 58 TV by Kris Straub (which I think should be checked by those who want to give it another chance) or it's well the comments made by most. Not very good.There's also the implied violence towards children which say no more. I completely get why people would be turned off of it as well.I actually watched this with a friend and we both got a bit unsettled not because of what was happening on the screen. The kids, the setting, the atmosphere of this film kind of unlocks memories in some of us. Most of them recollecting being a young child, for me atleast waking up alone, unaware of you're surroundings (fell asleep watching tv with my parents, waking up in the dark alone while they were in another room & I was hysterical after a few moments ) for the first time, abandonment etc. Being under the age of like 5, that's experiencing true fear for the first time. Add in that you never know if there's something lurking in the shadows.I think for those of us, whether the director meant to invoke that feeling or not (he's very tight lipped about the plot in interviews). It did it's job, bringing out a memory/moment that many may have just forgotten about. It's a horror film and it disturbed. Therefore he did his job.I love seeing and hearing about small creators get their moment to finally be recognized. Horror is the one the most subjective genres and it tends to get stagnant when one sub genre takes over for a couple years in the mainstream limelight. So I'm always eager to see what those are making on the outer fringes of the horror/film making community.",2023-02-03
"Skinamarink The Awakening of Evil (Skinamarink), one of the most popular nightmares comes to life: two children under the age of 7 wake up in the middle of the night and discover that their father is not there and all the windows and doors of their house have disappeared. From that moment on, the stress of feeling abandoned leads them to stay with their toys and worn-out video cartoons in the living room. Little by little the environment begins to transform to the point where it is clear that something is stalking them and they have nowhere to hide.The movie begins with a boy named Kevin and his sister Kaylee who leave their room at night, they are in the hallway for a while, later they go looking for their father, but they can't find him anywhere, the windows and House doors suddenly appear and disappear, faced with a situation the kids go to their living room to set up camp while watching creepy old cartoons on an outdated TV.If we see this film as a cinematographic exercise, we can appreciate trying to do something different, on the other hand there is not great image quality in the film, it was shot in a homemade lo-fi format on purpose, but that should not imply that almost all the tape makes it hard for the viewer to distinguish the images, likewise the pace of the film can be very slow for the viewer, to the point of making them sleepy, I say this from experience, really in my case it is very rare for it to happen, so go prepared with the liter of coffee.This is perhaps the worst ""horror"" movie of this decade, although they try to give an atmospheric terror, the tape is too sparse, for brief moments in the movie they seek to disturb the viewer, but they do not succeed, they only put the typical loud noise and the almost instantaneous image to try to make the viewer jump-scare, but they do not succeed, in the same way the bad framings stand out a lot where we only hear sounds from the score to suddenly and briefly put a little dialogue by the children who speak in most of the movie.Skinamarink can be more confusing than terrifying, it is really very subjective, from what I can understand there are two children who died and are in a kind of limbo, the parents try to communicate with them but they do not get a clear answer, in addition to the Children are accompanied by an entity that constantly offends them, threatens and incites them to do bad things, so far the premise sounds good, the big problem is the scant and non-existent story that the tape has, but above all its way of telling it.Rating: 5.0.",2023-05-12
1. Why on earth did they feel the need to shoot the whole movie in that retro cloudy 1970 but with a lot of filter BS picture? Actually being able to see what's going on would've been great.2. About an hour of the movie is absolutely nothing... now really sure why they thought it ok to make a movie where absolutely nothing happens for more than half of it... I thought my picture in my tv was broken cause u could hear people talking but the camera was out of focus... thinking about it makes me hate the movie even more... if you want to go to sleep this is your movie.. overall opinion? Don't waste your time unless you have nothing else to watch AT ALL.,2023-02-03
"{Film viewed in theaters 01/29/2023}I want to start with the obvious: this film is not for everyone. The theater was rather packed at the beginning of my viewing, mostly with adolescents, but at the end of the film there were only four viewers remaining: a rather young couple to the left of me, a middle-aged woman by her lonesome sitting in the row down from me, and myself, sitting in the top row on the seat furthest to the right, per usual.The adolescent couples sitting next to me at the beginning of the film say guzzling down their drinks, stuffing their faces with popcorn, checking their phones, and even vaping. Unimpressed by the slowness of the film and perhaps by the lack of action, they eventually arose simultaneously to leave the theater in youthful defiance. Meanwhile, another young couple who sat some rows down from me, probably approaching their late teens or possibly their early twenties, left later on, the boyfriend contemptuously exclaiming, ""My gawd, this film sucks!"" as he left the theater - yet this was not his grand exit, for he came back to retrieve some items either he or his girlfriend left in the theater; as did some of the other adolescents before him. It should be noted that this young couple entered the theater in a bad mood, with the girlfriend reprimanding the boyfriend for something (who knows what) and pointing her finger at him. Perhaps the boyfriend's exclamation was partially driven by his domineering girlfriend's influence over him; since he felt unable to rebel against his girlfriend, he used the film as something which he could rebel against... But that's all psychoanalysis.The film....The film utilizes sound very interestingly. Whereas most horror films use sounds in jump scares after periods of silence to startle viewers, this film has a static noise playing throughout, and as I recall has only two periods of silence which interrupt this incessant static noise; one moment of silence occurs during the film, and the other occurs at the end. These moments of silence highlight the creepiness of the film.This is a film to be watched by one's lonesome in my opinion. That's because it's a film that creeps under one's skin in a psychological manner similar to The Ring. I noticed that the couple to the left of me would cough, laugh, or whisper anytime the film was becoming increasingly uncomfortable. The youth who left the theater near the beginning of the film were probably looking for some action-based horror or something, who knows.But that's why this film is so brilliant. It takes one to the darkest crevices of his imagination, which are scarier than any typical cliche jump scares offered by other more mainstream horror films.I've seen just about every horror film there is, with some exceptions perhaps, and none have gotten to me like this film. This film was so creepy and just unsettling that I'd add it to my hierarchical trinity of cult horror. Perhaps the three most unsettling films I've seen are The Ring, Hereditary, and this film, Skinamarink.This is a true horror film, like The Ring and Hereditary. True horror unsettles, unnerves, perhaps even excites, one's spirit. There is something ""unholy"" about these three films, and this metaphysical bizarreness is palpable.It almost feels like one is traversing through his darkest childhood nightmares, and is forced to face them, which is more unsettling than any typical serial murder spree one might see in mainstream horror.I did find the end to be a tad pretentious, as the abrupt silence followed by the lettering, ""The End,"" didn't really work.Another facet of this film was the highlighting of inanimate objects as sources of horror, such as the children's toys. This was brilliant, as oft times it is these items which arise uncanny sensations in people, as if, should these toys or dolls be analyzed long enough, one might discover that there is more to them than meets the eye.This film is really meant to be watched in private by oneself; it is not a film for theaters, especially when younger audiences come in looking for excitement. This is a rather mature film which focuses on the metaphysical and psychological; thus it is not relatable to everyone, at least not on the surface. I found this film to be a deeply satisfying inward spiritual journey; a search for life's deeper meanings, beyond all the noise.",2023-01-28
"Resubmitting: I was so excited and looking forward to seeing this because I am a very picky horror fan, not the gory type with jump scares but something that is ingenious and atmospheric. So when the Globe and Mail reported that this is a viral sensation, that some people claim that it's the scariest film that they had seen, that in terms of ROI, it could be compared to the Blair Witch Project ($15,000 budget, $1.5 million in box office); that in terms of pace and technique, it could be compared to Wavelength by Michael Snow - I was expecting this to be clever and original, despite its low budget. It was a disappointment. Other than some Surreal moments, almost abstract cropped shots, and flipped points of view (nothing that I had not seen before), the film is just made up of repetitively similar visual compositions, audio effects, dialogues, and crudely edited transitions. There was nothing that led to any original or unique interpretations or truly scary moments. If it is to be compared to an art film, it is not; and if it's to be placed as a bone-chilling, scary, supernatural horror flick, it is not either. What it is though could have been the result of a well-timed, manipulated viral promotional technique, i.e. A meme. It was sadly a waste of my time and I doubt if I would change my opinion years later, realizing that I had missed the ingenuity and artistry of a brilliant idea.",2023-02-04
"I once had a film prof who, when I complained that I was struggling to get through the particularly long and impressionistic experimental film she was screening in class that day, gave me a piece of advice that I've never forgotten: every movie invites you to watch it on its own terms. Sometimes those terms are easy - sit back, eat some popcorn, enjoy the spectacle. At other times, those terms will ask for more patience, or a willingness to give the benefit of the doubt. A film isn't always a polished, consumable, digestible nugget of entertainment - sometimes it's a sculpture of particular emotion or a photograph capturing a memory. Sometimes you have to meet it halfway. Sometimes it makes you work, and that doesn't mean it's a bad film.Skinamarink is obviously not Capital-A Art the way an Ozu, Marker or Tarr film is - but it's also clearly drawing inspiration from them (especially Chris Marker, imo). A lot of reviews here suggest that this would be better as a 15- or 30-minute short. In terms of maximizing narrative this is correct - there is only about 30 minutes of actual story here. But the point of Skinamarink is not the story... the point is the texture.As horror films go, Skinamarink is a BIG ask of the audience. For starters, it isn't actually that scary, and it has very few of the hallmarks required of horror (although it does have a couple of jump scares). At the same time, Skinamarink is a fascinating exploration of liminal horror - an as-yet poorly represented evolution of the genre in mainstream horror, maybe most popularly known from The Back Rooms but with a lineage that can be traced back through Lynch's Lost Highway and Kubrick's The Shining (the recent Twin Peaks revival/third season did some great work in this space, but I digress.) In the sense that true terror can be extracted from a banal and overly familiar landscape, Skinamarink is at least interested in the attempt, even if it doesn't quite pull it off.Which brings me to my main criticism and point of contention: when it takes a break from home-movie-textured wandering about its liminal suburban-home space and tries to inject moments of actual horror-movie horror, Skinamarink is corny as f×××. The effect accompanying flickering, vanishing household accoutrements (windows and toilets, etc.) doesn't work and feels amateurish. The spooky parental figures appearing and disappearing don't really have the weight they need to have an impact. There are some moderately creepy images in the last 20 minutes, but this is a film deliberately presented without context, so there isn't much to be gained from them (that said, the very final shot is great, and I loved it. A more effective horror movie would have played with this a bit more, interspersing similar scenes throughout, but Skinamarink seems caught between horror subgenre and as a result misses the mark here.)One final aside: Skinamarink sometimes feels less like a film in its own right, and more like the cursed or haunted home movie that ends up being the MacGuffin of a more traditional horror movie like The Ring, or a conceit from a creepypasta. That doesn't in my view make it less interesting, but it does feel more like a once-removed artifact in retrospect than it does a fully-formed venture.I appreciate what Skinamarink is going for, and that it expands the field of liminal horror, even if it is not the definitive document of the subgenre. I'm glad that I watched it. I would also probably never recommend it to any horror fan. Students of experimental film and liminal explorations, however, may find something here of value.",2023-09-15
"As others have mentioned this needed to be a 20 or 30 minute short film, not a 1 hr 40 min feature length movie. I give the movie credit for its avantgarde style of filmmaking as well as the premise of the movie but that's about it. The Super 8 grainy look and the constant flickering from the various light sources was too much for the length of this movie. Putting that aside, what annoyed me the most is the lack of consistency in the movie's visual point of view. In some cases it was as if you were seeing things through the children's eyes, in other cases it's as if you were seeing things through the lens of a security camera placed on the floor and in other cases it's as if a camera was placed in the middle of the room.

"I need to call out 1 self-serving malcontent movie reviewer here ( mj2812) who has failed miserably here with failing to just simply display some proper etiquette & respect toward the other people who've taken the time to sit down and provide their opinionated review of a particular movie. I'm quite certain that the majority of reviewers out there are not look'n for some ""Roger Ebert Wannabe"" who possess that certain gaul & ignorance to always question and/or ridicule all others who provided an opinionated review of a movie, to where they feel the need to have to either explain or defend their review, that's not why IMDB provided this section, it's for those out there to take a moment to provide & share their ideas & views with all others. It was never ever intended to initiate something look'n like a heated political debate between IMDB reviewers! And try'n to reason and/or explain your opinionated review with an individual who walks around in life with a ""God-Complex"" almost certainly guarantee you only frustration & hopelessness, ohhh but not for you but for the sad Jackass who's never been wrong or said wrong in his/her life!! These lost-causes are best left for the higher power to handle in dure time. To end on a positive note & actually the real initial purpose of this site first & foremost, I like quite a few others was quite disappointed with the movie ""SKINAMARINK"" For me watching a movie & for me the movie viewer seemingly & really unwillingly sitting there & constantly inputting my very own assumed fears & frights as the movie progresses, to me sucked out all the assumed
enjoyment that I initially had prior to the start! And this where guys like mj2812 will surmise that well then that just goes to prove his point that such intellectual type movies like this are only meant for the select minority who understand whats involved with this particular film. And this of course is the one & only view of all these self-absorbed malcontents with their ""God-Complex"" And God forbid if somehow, someway they accidentally recognize the error in their ways or in their case, the error when they were first were born!! The only expected result & outcome here is one huge ""Hissy Fit!"" coming!! I'll leave with this, people & I'm especially addressing those who think, well you know what I'm about to say. Anyway, let's all try to start respecting all opininated reviews from everyone who chooses to submit one. Besides, its variance that makes things interesting. PEACE & SERENITY ALWAYS, D. J. Z.

"It's refreshing to see an Indie movie to try something new and doesn't follow the same, lame, uninspired Hollywood formular.The movie unfolds as memory-like snippets of story, which is open to interpretation and discussion, which makes it so much more appealing.Until the end you can't tell what is relly happening and why. Is it all in the childs head? Is the house haunted?Also on a positive note is the smart use of one jumpscare. Jumpscares are usually used for a cheap rush of adrenaline, but in this case it made you emphazise with the child and how it has experienced the situation at this moment.Hollywood lovers probably don't like the movie, but if you are into real horror and love unsettling movies, I can recommend this.",2023-02-02
"The concept is interesting, but that's as far as it goes regards any praise.The style could've been done for any horror script in the last 50 years, but the fact is the script isn't great, and so the filmmaker hides this cleverly inside the whole ""what you can't see will frighten you"" premise.I saw the trailer and was intrigued because it's different, but upon watching the film I realised it was a snapshot. I didn't get past 30 mins as I was getting frustrated.Could be like marmite, but I hate marmite so this is one man's opinion against millions.Watch it all or don't. I'm glad I didn't.",2023-05-21
"I will state I was looking forward to watching this movie when I heard about it from the film festival submissions. When the movie started there was a constant old record wheel grinding noise that never stopped playing in the background. On top of that if you are one taht likes looking at B-Film shots continuously then this is your movie. You never see faces on any character, only from the waist down. The movie is very slow, and doesn't pick up until 1 hour into the movie. I don't recommended this movie, because its not scary at all, and it made no sense whatsoever. You have been warned.......",2023-01-19
"Pros:Some standout scenes that are genuinely scaryGreat use of sound design and surreal visuals to create unease and claustrophobiaSome things are only seen or heard but left unclear, forcing me to speculate on what could've happened. To me that made it scarierThe kids performed wellI like the look of the movieCons:Yes, there are way too many scenes where nothing happens that I assume are just there to set the mood. I got bored at times and I can see why a lot of people didI know they're kids and maybe it was a creative choice, but I wish the dialogue was less mumbly and difficult to hear. Especially since there's so little of itA lot of people say this movie has no plot, which is not true at all. The plot is thin and forces you to fill in the gaps, but it's there and it points to something disturbing. But I do wish it was more substantial.Overall I really liked the movie for doing something unique, creating an unsettling atmosphere, and having some disturbing implications. I think it's a great debit for the director. But for a feature length movie, it needed to have more substance.",2023-08-21
"Extremely boring no build up, script or timeline. Camera focuses on legos and walls for minutes at a time. Very dark and can't hear or see anything that's going on. The movie makes absolutely no since you never really understand what's going on. To make things worse there are too many exhaustive pauses combined with strange camera angles. After starting at legos for 5 min you think something exciting might possibly happen but then the camera takes another pause onto the celling. You really feel like the director is purposely wasting your time, so that by the end of the movie you not only feel confused and pissed but also bored.",2023-01-21
"This movie is a slow, atmospheric descent into childhood fears. Before I get in to the nitty-gritty, I have to say that it's not for everybody and certainly not for the jump scare enthusiasts. It's slow and methodical. You won't get jump scare satisfaction. Instead, you'll get deep seeded fright and dread. It feels like you're a child having a nightmare.There won't be creepy faces that scream at you. It doesn't take place in an impossibly creepy mansion. It takes place in any house. Every house. Your house. It calls in to focus the impossibility of childhood nightmares and the desperation for protection against the unknown.It's not for everybody, but it should resonate with everyone.",2023-08-22
Horrible waste of time...wish i could get time I wasted back from my life...barely makes sense and worse than blair witch for camera footage...can someone explain this movie as it makes little or no sense whatsoever!!!I guess a supernatural being takes over and tortures an entire family. Somehow it seems like an unethical psychological experiment gone wrong or horrible parents...call CPS already...too much unanswered questions...like a short from twilight zone....just garbage. The kids get terrorized and their awful parents are 100% useless the entire movies (see blair witch standing in the corner parents).Sad need 600 words to describe what I can in one: awful!!!,2022-10-31
"Skinamarink is definitely an artsy film, but if you enjoy strange, creepy, or mysterious movies, I would definitely recommend. Despite many people rating this movie very low, I suspect it may partially be because they either didn't know what they were getting into, or simply don't like the type of movie Skinamarink is. It's totally fine to dislike a certain type of movie, but it doesn't mean the movie is inherently bad. This movie is definitely interesting and has a few different theories. You can really dive deep into the details of this movie, and as long as you are prepared and have the patience for it, Skinamarink can be a good time.",2023-08-07
"Without a doubt the absolute worst film thst I have ever seen... there is little to no plot, no story, no anything really. There is maybe about 2 to 3 small jump scares that only work to the use of the high pitched screeching chalkboard type noise but other than that it's almost 2 hours of the most unappealing grainy out of focus video that is looking either at the ceiling or the floor. Avoid this movie at all costs if your time is precious to you. But there again this is purely just my opinion some of you may like what this movie is tryingto become. It is only through a random post i saw saying that people were vomiting in the cinemas watching this that i found it to watch. If people really vomiting in cinemas then i can only put it down to some dodgey food at the cinema lobby . I couldn't think of a single positive in regards to Skinamarink.",2023-03-09
"The audience for this movie is limited to 1. The self-indulgent director, 2. People who like ""artsy"" snoozefests, and 3. People who don't like ""artsy"" snoozefests but say they do.This movie is the most worthless pile of nothing. The pacing isn't slow, it's nonexistent. The plot is so threadbare your gram's couch from the 1970s has more to it at this point. The directing is so pretentious it's offensive.Given the choice to rewind time sp I didn't waste it on this movie OR getting slap the director, I'd really want to choose the latter but would reclaim my time because the director doesn't even deserve that much of my time or energy.",2023-04-07
"Years of using IMDB this forced me to finally make an account and comment. Literally the worst movie I've ever seen. Everyone in the theater agreed, literally said it was torture sitting through it. I'm all for slow paced and not being force feed. There's maybe 12 lines in the movie and the footage is of the ceiling and the carpet the entire time. If you're saying you like this you're legit trying to feel deep and artsy and it's fake. This was a robbery of money to roll over into other films. 15k budget for a profit on opening weekend. Absolute trash, I'm so angry I wasted 1hr45min. This movie ends the way it begins....with absolutely nothing. I've never left a theater so angry in my 31 years......just wow.",2023-01-21
"I understand that when you look at this movie on the surface, it seems plain, simple, and boring. But, if you try to really understand what the movie means, the movie becomes scarier, sadder, and much more intense.Interpretation one: this is a metaphor for abuse. At the beginning of the movie, when Kevin ""falls"" down the stairs, it's likely a parent being abusive and pushing him. Kaylee, who often is shown to be Kevin's protector through the movie, takes him downstairs to hide. However, her ability to protect Kevin soon disappears when her mouth and eyes are taken away, likely killed, sent away, or shut down in some way. Kevin's mother is also killed, either by suicide or by Kevin's father's own hand. When the voice says ""put the knife in your eye"", it means become blind to the situation. The whole house is a metaphor for him not being able to escape the trauma and the situation.Interpretation two: when Kevin falls down the stairs, he falls into a coma. The cartoons come from the TV in front of his hospital bed, and he cannot escape. He also is forced to use a bedpan, hence why the toilets disappear. His family visits at first, especially Kaylee, but then they all give up and stop visiting. The ""knife in his eye"" is probably from multiple brain surgeries, where the doctors often go through the eye to access the brain. The mother, distressed, kills herself, hence why there's so many dolls hanging from the ceiling. At the end, she leads him into the afterlife by telling him to go to sleep. He ended up in that coma for 572 days before passing away.",2023-08-16
"My daughter and I love horror movies, and she wanted to see this one. It looked like it could be pretty creepy; we saw the trailer in the theaters. It had pretty good reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, but unfortunately it is mind-numbing and sleep-inducing (interesting, considering the movie's last line). Some reviewers must be easily creeped out, because there was at best two moments that gave me creeps, and for a nearly 2 hour film, that's not enough. What kept coming to mind is that the film like a very low budget riff on Sinister.I wouldn't even really consider it a movie. As mentioned in other reviews, it's way too long. I can't say whether the filmmaker saw David Lynch's Lost Highway, but it definitely seems to attempt the exploration of darkness and potential evil lurking in the darkness of Lost Highway. However, Skinamarink comes off as about too little, in which the choice of using the darkness and the lack of anything specifically seen definitely feels more because of the limited budget and not so much creative choice.As well, the endless shots of the tv playing Skinmarink cartoon and the legos are ridiculous and really irritating. These shots may have consisted of up to 25% of the entire movie. The filmmaker uses a lot of low angle and high angle shots to give off a distorted reality and distorted perspective, but it just gets annoying and feels less creative than it is just trying to make the viewer wonder why the shots are like this. It does eventually play some kind of purpose in the film, with gravity changes having something to do with the ""mystery"" of what's happening.Aside from the angle shots, which I'm aware are supposed to be representing young children's confused perspectives, there are also several minutes total of what feel like absolutely meaningless shots of wall lights.The purpose of what is supposed to feel as if the film was footage from a video camera is also confusing. The filmmaker has said he loves The Blair Witch Project, but at least that filmmaking style had a definite purpose. Here, about 60% of the film consists of weird angles of things, but then the other 40% consists of the same camera being used in the POV of one of the kids. Therefore, we're supposed to assume every shot is from a video camera that one of the kids is either sitting down with or walking around with. If that's the movie's logic, then the movie doesn't stick to or think carefully enough about it's own logic. The camera is obviously not in the child's perspective or being held by anybody but deliberately filming the events of the story, so then it suddenly being seen as part of the kids' perspective really just makes the choices made here seem amateurish, not a deliberate filmmaking choice but a filmmaking mistake. One thing you can say about David Lynch; anything that doens't make sense to the viewer in his films is a deliberate choice.It also doesn't help the film that all the credits including emotional acknowledgments to the family whose home this was filmed in, along with one of the filmmakers that passed away before this film was released, are put at the beginning of the film. The film would have been creepier if it didn't have these credits at the beginning of the movie, as if it just started with the camera recording in the house. The goal of this film seems to be to not feel like a film, to be a somewhow recorded perspective of the kids experiencing something scary in their house. Unfortunately, making the choice to put these credits, especially very personal comments about how the film was made, where it was made, and who helped get it made, immediately handicaps any attempt at creating a creepy mood. I was thinking the entire length of the film about how they filmed it in a family friend's house with the help of that family.The film could possibly be a creepier experience if it's watched on a tv at home with the lights off. It doesn't feel suitable for a dark movie theater. Most of the people in the theater all laughed and talked about wasting their money after it was over. Watching it alone in one's house might be a better experience. I wasted almost 45.00 at the theater seeing this, because it wasn't playing at the theater I get discounts at. It wouldn't have felt wasted if the film was actually scary. The only positive experience I had seeing this in the theater is that I contributed to the theater experience and helped support cinemas and their employees.",2023-01-18
"Thankfully I didn't waste any money seeing this. Thanks shudder & my remote to fast forward 90 min of nothingness to stop here and there to see if I was gonna see something cool happen. I didn't. Is there something going to be under the bed!? No. Oh I'd something going to come out of the dark hall!? No.Will a creepy demon thing come crawling on the ceiling!? No. Fast forward wall shot. Fast forward kids feet shot. Fast forward another wall shot. They really need to fix that paint peeling at the top. Fast forward 20 Lego shots. Oh the back of a lady! How exciting! :insert eye roll:
I had zero clue what was to be going on. If you were to read the general synopsis,""2 children wake up in the middle of the night to find their father is missing, all the windows and doors in their home have vanished."" you see one window & door appear/disappear, thats it. You see doors everywhere. I got to see a faceless girl, cool but not scary, just cool that we got to see something besides a wall or Legos.It wasn't until I googled the film and headed to read the plot on wiki did I think, oh, ok now That would have been a film I'd of liked to have seen...because that was nothing close to what I fast forwarded through. This could have been a cool horror short with a max 15-20 run time. But geez 100 min? I feel bad for those who spent money on this.I have grown up watching and loving horror films. I enjoy watching b & c grade horror films -- they are hilarious! I love watching new horror. This is not horror. Unless you count wondering if it's your TV or the movie that makes it where you can't see anything but grain from the ""cool retro vibe."" we had a camcorder in the 90s when I was younger. Our videos were much better looking than this.Who's view are we to be watching from? The kids? The demon? The camera dad dropped before the kid fell down the stairs? (which you don't see, just hear tumble tumble cry and dad talking to someone on the phone. ) again go to wiki, read the plot, and use your imagination on what good a movie that plot could have been.",2023-03-12
I would not call this a movie. It is more like an experimental arthouse film. It is an extremely slow burn that leads nowhere. It has some interesting camera angles and three semi-suspensful moments.

"Literally nothing happens don't waste your time, no explanations or anything. Could not be more disappointed with this pile of garbage. I wasted an entire 1hr and 40 mins of my life fighting to stay awake and was barely able. I was looking for deeper meanings or something the entire time and was unable to find anything of substance. Every scene is identical and way too ""experimental"" or in other words garbage. It would have been much better as just a found footage more similar to paranormal activity. If there was any substance it could've been amazing, however there was hardly any context or explanation for anything.

"This film tries so hard to make you afraid of the dark and be the kind of movie that has you jump into bed so the monsters under it can't grab your feet but never comes close to reaching that. It feels like someone got a new camera and wanted to record something with it but had no props and so just took long random shots of furniture and hallways.The sound design is pretty interesting, doors slamming shut sound as if they're heavier than the look. More static noise than dialogue. The use of color is pretty to look at also.But man oh man this will test your patience. After 15 minutes I was already considering turning it off and finding something else to watch. Unfortunately I fast forwarded to see if anything happened and when I resumed play I heard probably the best line in the whole movie and that made me want to find out what was happening so I went back and watched the part I skipped only to find out that no, nothing did happen.I tried so hard to look for some deep symbolism but even if there was any it felt like it's not really saying anything that meaningful.It's basically a more modern and creepy version of 1967 wavelength mixed with a little bit of insidious and paranormal activity. The effects of things popping in and out of existence reminded me of the twilight zone.The little slices of stuff happening are not enough to justify the majority of the runtime being meaningless. It doesn't add tension or suspense it's just trying to be artsy.The closest thing to being scary was a face with no eyes or mouth, a hand appearing on the door frame. Something falls off a wall. Creepy distorted laughing.Whatever.",2023-02-16
"Some people have stated it's the worst movie they've seen in their entire life. So, you've only seen two movies in your entire life then? This movie and ""Disaster Movie?"" Because this film is brilliant. I understand if you didn't like it, and if this movie wasn't for you. Give it a 4. Or a 3 even. But a 1? C'mon. And another thing, yeah I'll take some shots at my so-called fellow ""horror fans"" out there who gave this a ""1"" rating, if you rate this a 1/10, you obviously just don't get it, nor do you appreciate different levels of horror. All the haters should just stick to what makes them comfortable: mainstream formula-fed horrors. Because branching out apparently is out of reach for you.Sorry for the rant, but I'm sick of people dishing out 1 star ratings because they expect scares and gore every ten seconds. There is a subtle aspect of this film that hits deep, that many people miss. It's almost as if electromagnetic cognitive receptive nodes (I may or may not have made that all up) have been attached to a young child's brain during a nightmare infused R. E. M. Sleep and refracted the child's brain waves to a visual spectrum accompanied by some of the strangest and most disturbing audial effects. Put that all on film, and BAM! You get one of the most perfect visual portrayals of an actual nightmare on film.Basically it's a brave experiment that I greatly appreciate. The trailer itself is beyond creepy. The film is grainy, almost always avoiding any clear visual conception of what is happening in this strange, altered world of the children's perception. The result is abstract, weird, and misunderstood. Often times, because the images are so grainy and difficult to make out, it does a great job ""hiding"" subtle, visual scares that make the audience go ""wait, what was that"" or ""did you see that??"" and then rewind it to confirm if that really was what they indeed saw. These are my personal favorite types of scares.People expect graphic scenes these days, like out of ""Terrifier"" or ""Barbarian."" Great movies, for sure. But it seems like the only change a lot of people like is more violence, more gore. But those elements alone do not define what makes a horror film a ""TRUE"" horror.This film moves in an alternate, more conspicuous yet unnerving manner. It's almost as if the audience shares a consciousness with the children in the movie. It's scary and frightening. The children in the film do not quite know how to respond to the events in the film, and neither does the audience. It's rather fun and inventive filmmaking.But it's not for everybody. It may not be for you. But if you like different, if you like slow, subtle mind-altering horror, then you might like this. Just give it some credit because it deserves it, that's all I ask. Because there's one thing I can guarantee: they'll be talking about this in the years to come, and it WILL become a cult classic as more and more people recognize it for its genius. Don't agree? Understandable. Don't agree and think it's the ""worst horror movie ever?"" Stick to Hollywood remakes and modern regurgitated Disney flicks, because you obviously hate anything genuinely creative and scary.",2023-08-26
"Spoiler the movie litterly starts off with shots of random corners the ceiling base boards none of which are lit properly for film. The idea was to be clever and inventful however when you litterly have to put the one good review in the begining of your movie you know the maker knew that they had scooped a giant turd out of the toilet and pawned it off on an unsuspecting audience. Seeing that this film has garnished any thing above a 2/10 is beyond me. The story is simple little boy falls down stairs now try to figure out if he's seeing things or if it's real. Apparently it's a reference to child abuse. The only child abuse in this movie was making that child be in it forever. This story could have been a ten minute short and told itself just fine. The camera man was not very good at his/her job. Any time something happens it's off screen except for around two or three shots. It almost feels like the filmmaker and I use that term very lightly, wanted you to get so bored and annoyed by the camera work that you either fall asleep or turn it off. Sadly enough there's really nothing scary about this unless loud sounds scare you. Honestly I'm glad I saw it for free if it had been in a theatre half way through I'd have been demanding a refund. I implore the maker of this movie to find a different job. The world doesn't need more bad films. So do yourself a big favor and don't watch this.",2023-08-23

If you dislike thinking during a film, and would rather have everything specifically told to you, this is not the film for you. I'm not sure who this film is really for. Perhaps for those who house a traumatized inner-child within them. Perhaps for those who are sick of Hollywood's rinse and repeat slaughter fest formula. I recommend all to see it and form their own opinion, whether that opinion be negative or glowing, it is truly a unique experience either way. Highest recommendation.",2023-02-03

In reality it seemed like art school stop animation film making. Lots of still scenes with voice overs, subtitles. Nothing scary about this other than how bad the movie actually was. Do yourself a favour and completley skip this movie. Unless you want to be bored for 1h40min. I'd give it zero stars except the minimum is one.

"Both of these statements are true:
It took me all the strength and determination I had not to fall asleep while watching this movie.I absolutely loved this movie and still think about it regularly.I don't think a single score is appropriate for this movie. It's a 2/10 and a 9/10 at the same time, and it's definitely not a middle-ground between the two (5/10) either. It's just very boring in some aspects and very interesting in others.It's been a very long time since I've seen a horror film that really tried something. So many horror films (The Conjuring, etc...) just feel like Disney/Marvel movies with a big CGI fight at the end, and there is barely any trace of horror left in there. Skinamarink really tried something. It creates a whole atmosphere and a whole mood of horror, and it wants to achieve this at all costs. It's so interesting (and boring)",2023-05-17
"The Black Phone was supposed to be (for many) the best horror movie of the year, I dare to say Skinamarink is way better in what horror refers.I mean, it's original in the way it was filmed, the montage makes you feel tense and worried, and of course, who needs jumps cares when you can be terrified of getting up in the middle of the night for a glass of water after you watched this.Just enjoy it, if your favorite horror movie it's a slasher or a remake of the remake, don't watch this and don't throw your hate in here.Congrats to the whole crew.

The first 5 minutes was arty and built up some kind of atmosphere, even though I always thought ""yea yeah, now start the real movie with the plot"".I then realized they did everything in their power to break all rules of making a movie. All camera angles were basically pointing up on the ceiling, there were not really any actors. No plot, no music, just random words, random shots, random stuff. Everything was random.It could maybe be good as a background movie at a theme park haunted house where you don't actually watch the movie.I gave up after 30 minutes. What a waste of time.",2023-08-17

I seen the most original and horrifying film of 2022 and I made the biggest mistake of watching it at home and alone in the dark. Must watch this with other people and with some lights. A surreal, atmospheric, visual experimental nightmare. It definitely has David Lynch vibes. I hope Stephen King reviews it. I would love to see more from Kyle Edward Ball. He has a fantastic YouTube channel. Totally recommend this!!!!!!!",2022-12-09
"No pun intended and just my sarcastic side showing its face. Talking of showing face (you could argue this was another pun, if you've watched the movie), there is not much of that going on here. I assume this can be credited as artful decision - or the people involved did not want their face seen. Whatever the case, the movie will split you - not in a nice gory way.I am just kidding of course (I think) - you will either hate or love this. Well you may also just be annoyed by it. Which I reckon is the middle ground? You decide - you can attest that the movie has an artful side to it. You could also have a sarcastic take (much like mine) and assume that anyone can make a movie by simply shooting things and put some creepy music over it - make it in mono so the sound effects scare the living you know what out of people ... and voila, you have a movie, that some will consider awesome.Not trying to shame anyone, I am happy for every single person who enjoyed this. I know it didn't do well at the Festival I attended and I wasn't too impressed myself. This is more of an artistic experiment. Hopefully not one where the filmmaker was thinking: how do I prank people who think they know art and pretend to like anything that is weird ... not caring about something being coherent and all that.But again, this plays with the fear of darkness, fear of being alone and other fears ... of mono sounds too of course. If you never watched a movie that had a mono soundtrack turned up to 11 (as they say), you won't know what I am talking about ... let's just say quite loud, even the smallest noises can be deafening. Anyway, there is a lot of buzz surrounding this and I am happy for everyone involved in this - but as a viewer I have to warn you ... while for some this is the scariest thing this year (watch more movies maybe?) others will find this as boring and annoying as possible ...",2023-04-24
"Few directors throughout cinematic history have had the kind of vision, courage, and fortitude necessary for filming two full hours of walls, floors, and ceilings, and then passing it off to a paying audience as entertainment but Kyle Edward Ball was up for the challenge.In horror cinema there is a maxim: sometimes what you can't see is scarier than what you can see. Mr. Ball took that concept to heart and chose to show the viewer absolutely nothing at all.The audience isn't expected to fill in a few shadowy gaps with their imaginations but rather to write their own stories entirely and entertain themselves for the duration.The best thing I can say about Skinamarink is that the premise was almost interesting. Granted it was original but it also serves as a prime example of why originality isn't always a good thing.No plot, no effects, no actors, no nothing.My advise to potential viewers is to just watch the trailer. It will be just as bad and just as boring but much much shorter.If you think I'm exaggerating, go with god. -but bring a book.",2023-02-06
"When I first heard about Skinamarink, I thought it sounded like one of those weird Kyle Edward Ball movies. And I was right: it is one of those weird Kyle Edward Ball movies. But is that a bad thing? Let's find out!The premise is simple: two small children (Kevin and Kaylee) wake up in the middle of the night to discover their father is missing, and the nature of the house is changing erratically.All windows and exterior doors are spontaneously replaced by walls (preventing any escape), toys and other objects warp into eldritch shapes, and household items randomly flicker in and out of existence.Some of the lights still work, but the rest of the house remains in semi- or total darkness. Even the flow of time appears inconsistent.As Kevin and Kaylee explore the house, they encounter a mysterious and unmistakeably sinister presence. Then, without warning, it begins to speak.If you're already familiar with Ball's work, you'll have a good idea of what to expect here. If you're not, you're in for a rare treat. Be aware that this is an experimental film, and defies the usual genre categories.Ball produced Skinamarink on a micro-budget in just seven days, with a case of four, using digitally replicated film grain and aggressive framing techniques. His application of oblique angles is particularly unsettling.Sound design is exceptional for a production of this calibre, and I was impressed by Ball's courageous decision to use a 10 layer audio track without any music.I rate Skinamarink at 23.31 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as an ambitious 7/10 on IMDB.",2023-04-15
"The most boring, lazy, pointless, poorly filmed, plotless, film with no character development, no story, and ZERO redeemable qualities.I LOVE horror movies, and the preview looked creepy enough for me to give it a chance, This movie was definitely a nightmare, but not in a good way. Suffering through this movie to the end was truly like torture.I guess the camera work was meant to be different, creepy, artsy, or from the perspective of a child, but it came across as just lazy and bad. It was like a child playing with an 8mm camera in a poorly lit house from the 1970's for an hour and forty minutes just filming (mostly still shots of things partially in frame) of the ceiling, the carpet, doorways, toilets, furniture, beds, etc. All poorly lit, at pointless angles, and focusing on each shot for WAY too long. There's likely less than 5 minutes of the entire 1-hour and 40 minutes where ANYTHING of consequence is happening, none of it scary, none of it interesting, none of it tolerable.I watched till the end thinking that there MUST be some redeeming quality at the end for it to have earned the 5.1 IMDB score it had when I watched it, but there was NOTHING. I seriously can NOT believe that ANYONE would score this any higher than 1 star. The maker MUST have a LARGE group of friends that they got to give it a high rating without watching it. There's just no way anyone sane or sober could enjoy being slowly bored to death for an hour and forty minutes.",2023-02-25
"I was thinking to myself as we were an hour in... if I was ever captured by terrorists, they could play this video on repeat for 24 hours and I would crack. I would tell them everything they wanted to know, including the address of my ex wife and in laws.Here is the movie: 120 mins of weird camera angles in a house, various shots of the floor with legos, and cartoons from the 70s on repeat.Mix in shots of kids feet with them asking ""where did you go"" and you have the entire movie.The people that LOVE these kinds of movies are the liberal arts students who don't make art for entertainment. They make it to be different. They don't want to be known as conformist so they pump
Out garbage experimental nonsense like this movie and some studio that's desperate markets the movie as a horror flick.Please save your hard earned money. And if the writer and director is reading this, please find a new profession.",2023-01-15
"Not sure why everyone is bashing this film, but I can only assume it's because they're used to modern mainstream horror that's filled to the brim with nothing but jumpscares and constant action. Let me tell you that this film is amazing.The childhood of those who grew up in the late 90's and early 2000's is so accurately represented here. The way the movie feels is less like a film and more of an experience, which sounds cliche, but I can assure you that this is one of the few films that truly deserves such a descriptor as ""an experience.""The framing decisions are a true breath of fresh air, making the dimensions of the home itself mostly unknown, which adds to the surreal and otherworldly atmosphere of the film. The confusion, misconceptions and paranoia of childhood fear is rife within this movie, making those of you who are old enough remember those nights of basking in the blueish glow of your old box television, the only light in the room to illuminate the potential monsters and the only sound to cut through the paranoid thoughts.The film grain is actually a really nice touch, making every shot that is saturated in darkness crawl, tricking your eyes into seeing something moving in the darkness. The movie only has a few jumpscares, but this film gets a pass for at least nailing the feelings of impending doom, which is way more than I can say for many modern ""horror"" films, most of which just wanting to be marketable slashers.What really impressed me about this film is just how accurately it represents the essence of a nightmare. The darkness almost feels like an entity unto itself, exuding a feeling of corruption. The way that the parents in this film behave is also highly reminiscent of a nightmare, which I could go further into, but I don't want to spoil this film.I could keep going about this movie, but I'll cut it short here as to not write a novel. All-in-all, this movie is a masterpiece of horror. Sure, it's not nonstop action until the end, but I feel that true horror fans are becoming fatigued with the same old blood, guts and gore that we've been getting for many, many years now.Modern horror seems to be all about proprietary slashers/creatures, tired gimmicks, marketability and using lazy jumpscares for every ""scare"" instead of actually utilizing atmosphere and very uncomfortable concepts to get under the audience's skin.The true horror fans are getting sick of everything being about chopping up bodies. I think we're ready for a change to the existential and the surreal.",2022-10-29
"I just had to review this , although I only made it to thirty minutes in . Any sane person would not enjoy this whatsoever . Its possibly the worst thirty minutes of my life where movies is concerned . I mean how the hell did this rubbish even get released ? Was it released as a bet ? Did someone owe someone a favour ? Seriously its utter arty farty hodmgwash tripe . If you did watch this to the end then you deserve some kind of award from the Oscars or something. Also if you did watch this to the end and you say it was good , then I put it to you that you are a liar or just want to be part of the art brigade who think blank canvases are amazing . Thank you and don't watch it .",2023-02-11
This movie was an absolute waste of time. The overly dark scenes coupled with the grain effect made it incredibly difficult to watch. The reason for watching something is so I can actually see it. The use of the unorthodox camera angles I found more irritating and actually took away from the tension they were trying to create with them. The volume fluctuations made it so hard to hear dialogue that I found the closed captions were an absolute necessity. The jump scares were too few and far between and were needed because I couldn't even allow myself to get into the movie enough to feel the character tension with them. The volume of the jump scares also is a problem because we had the volume up so loud to try and hear the dialog that it physically hurt my ears when they went full volume with the moment. If you still absolutely find yourself having to watch it I hope you enjoy it more than we did.,2023-02-11
"This has got to the worst film I've ever seen, there's no story.. OK I lie there's a small story two kids wake up in the night to find there dad missing and the things in the house keep missing that's it that's the story for a whole 1 hour and 40 mins just things going missing you don't see the children's faces or the parents it's just a camera facing towards a wall or a toy or the ceiling and the kids whispering which sounds like there whispering straight into a microphone, the camera used is old so you don't even get to see properly, I mean seriously just don't even bother I do not believe for one moment this film had people vomiting in the cinema it's nearly sent me to sleep, I will not be telling anyone to watch this I don't want them missing a hour and 40 mins of there life, oh and the ghost voice sounds like a middle aged man.",2023-03-09
"Honestly, retro audio with a lot of noise, betamax quality video, set in a dark environment, not pointing the camera at the actual action. Just the random angles, the ocasional jump scares. The movie did not scare me, it is very disorienting, it should have started with an epilepsy ""might trigger seizures"" due to flashing lights, the constant flickering gave me a headache.Plot: parents talking about sleepwalking child that fell down the stairs, sister dies halfway through, boy gets stalked by an unseen force. THE ENDIn my opinion this is more of what the boy experienced when he died after he fell down the stairs.",2023-01-25
"Having heard so much about this my partner and I sat down last night to give this one a watch, now there are flaws in this film and quite a few, no matter what the high ratings say also there were positive aspects as well.I get what the director was trying to do, I get it, angles, if he had just done a straight horror movie then people would have jumped up and said he had just done another Paranormal Activity movie, so to cover that side of it he did angles.Secondly the film was to long which i hate to say, it seemed in some scenes he just dragged it on a bit to much, especially the ending.The pluses were I applaud the director for thinking outside the box and take my hat off to him.Now don't get me wrong, I am a huge horror film fan and this film is not scary in one bit, yes there were two noticeable jump scares and you do sort of get a feeling of dread near the end but scary, no.It would have been just as scary and the same type of film of he had made it using normal angles and just filmed a normal Paranormal movie.Now the question really is, who would I recommend this movie to? Well horror fans, no I wouldn't because I know most would come back and say it's to pretentious, why doesn't he just make a normal horror film, then there are the so called movie buffs, well no either, they would not like it, why because after all the angles in this film it comes down to one thing, it's just another horror film.Now don't get me wrong, we did enjoy this movie but I don't know who to recommend this movie to.Altogether this film comes down to its just another horror movie but with angles.This is just another Paranormal Activity movie, in which the director could have filmed it normally and it would have been just as good.This movie is neither the scariest thing you will ever see nor is it worth more than four stars.Remember when Terrifier 2 came out and the media said that that movie was one of the scariest movies out and people were fainting in the cinemas, remember it's hype by the media for us to go and watch these films.Don't believe any hype, just go and see it if you want to.Four stars at the most.",2023-01-17
"This is low budget, mildly inventive stuff. Treated with a VHS look, with blown out light, flattened colour and some retro grain. It's out to create an atmosphere. Two young kids wake up in the middle of the night. An old film playing on a TV somewhere flicks off and we're left in near silence. Shots cut to various close up abstracts of ceilings and floors and floors that look like ceilings. The child's point of view, literally turning upside down. They call for their dad, in creepy muffled echoey voices. There's no reply. The pace is labourious. You need a lot of patience. The kids watch cartoons. We see their feet and legs wander around. They draw. They pass the time. The point (and the criticism) to lull you into a twilight sense of unease. There's very little movement. Either from the camera or within the frame. The narrative driven solely by whispered questions from the faceless children to each other, then to something else. It's weird from the outset, but things get weirder as the collective waking nightmare progresses. Things in places they shouldn't be. Things missing where they should be. The house is wrong. There's little point in saying much more, through fear of spoiling the effect. The truth is this is a very sparse film and the mood it creates and effect it conjures is really all it has. It's experimental arthouse horror and thus won't be for everyone. I'm not even sure it's for me. It would certainly benefit from a bit of trimming, but the idea is good, the execution well delivered, but it's a struggle. The sound design is good. There's a few really cool looking shots. It's got style. I'll give it that. Fair enough it's been made for peanuts, but a little more substance would go a long way.",2023-02-19
"One hour and three minutes into this 110-minute film and nothing yet has happened. The only thing keeping me going is the fact I'm on IMDB reading all the reviews, keeping myself fairly occupied as I sift through the positive reviews looking for any helpful nuggets of information as to what's happening. No such luck. Even the great reviews just speak upon the artsy fartsy vibe. The scariest thing thus far has been the abundance of Legos scattered all over the floors. I'm baffled how we haven't gotten a bare-footed scream-scene yet. Now THAT is terrifying. Watch with subtitles because the sound is absolutely terrible. Voices and dialogue completely muted and unclear, yet any sort of crinkling or background noise or tv channel is turned up to 10. This is purely self-indulgence; if you're losing 95% of your audience who goes to see it, there's a problem. I'm not sure I would have been able to stay either, I've only gotten this far because I've paused it a couple times to get up and do other things. I'm glad I'm using my free sample of Shudder to watch this, as I would have been pretty miffed paying to watch this.",2023-02-03
"Just because it's confusing, doesn't make it smart.This movie does plenty of things right. It had a unique style (even for found footage), it has good scares, creepy tones, ominous lighting, scarry voices, unnatural whispering etc. In other words in has all the bits and pieces to make a scarry movie.It just doesn't have a coherent story, informative dialogue, a real ending, explanation or any kind of conclusion.And I get it. I'm not smart. Everyone else is hip and I'm just an old ignorant stick in the mud that likes plot development and story structure. How lame I am.Look this movie has a few scares. Thats it. I like found footage. I really do. But this is a sub par effort.",2023-04-02
"I think I just finished watching one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I love horror movies, but this was not a horror movie. It was barely even a movie. The movie implies a plot with visuals you can see and audio you can hear. Not random shots of the corners of rooms or inaudible, mumbling with occasional subtitles. If I didn't read a snippet before the movie of what it was about, I would have absolutely no clue. I still really have no idea what happened or what I just saw. A complete waste of time. I fell asleep twice during it and must've checked the time left in the movie at least four or five times. Horrible, awful, miserable, any other negative adjective you can think of. Do not go anywhere close to this movie. Do your life a favor and skip it.",2023-08-18
"The preview of this movie proves that Skinamarink
would have made a great 5 minute short. Instead, you get over an hour and a half of staring at walls, wondering if this was going to turn into a movie about the horrors of stepping on Lego at night. The best part of the movie was when my wife came back from the restroom and asked ""what did I miss?"" ""Some Legos fell over"", I replied. She then spent the next five minutes trying to contain giggles.Either someone got paid for some glowing reviews, it this is what idiots think art looks like. It looked like a feature length version of a film school project.",2023-01-31
"This is a remarkable movie. I was immediately engaged and disturbed by the film, and at the precise moment I thought to myself ""this is upsetting but it's not that scary"", it got really REALLY scary. If you were a kid who sailed though childhood without a care in the world, this is not your movie. If you were a kid who had this exact nightmare over and over, and experienced regular doom and dread because you were overly anxious or under-parented, this is the movie for you. It's one of the most unique and effective films I've ever seen. It could definitely be 20 mins shorter, but I feel like the director earned those minutes, so I can forgive him for them. And while most experimental films bore the crap out of me, or make me gag on the pretension, this one feels like a celebration. The scares are so exquisitely scary, I'll be thinking about it forever.",2023-01-22
"I came into this movie so open because the trailer was eerie. ...If I would have known the movie was exactly 2 hours of the trailer I would have HARD PASSED.First of all, if ""White Noise"" puts you to sleep, I would advise not watching this movie. There. Is. Only. White. Noise. The. Whole. Movie. You hear/read less than 75 words the whole movie & there is no soundtrack.The WHOLE concept being pushed is ""the doors and windows disappear."" That's the tag line & the trailer tag line. Bro, 1 window disappeared, and ONE TOILET! That's ALL we saw. And to be honest, the dorky game show noise that played while they disappeared was also annoying.You never see a character's face all you ever see is ankles and feet. Its 15 second frames of white noise and weird angles of the interior of a house.Do you like top of door frames? This movie is for you. Do you like seeing the back of a couch with the light from the TV on the other side? This movie is for you. Do you like watching the same scene on a 3 play loop over and over? This movie is for you.Honestly. I was tempted to walk out about 20 minutes in, but I fell asleep.",2023-01-21
Not in a bad way but in the way that I was terrified and Distressed throughout the entire thing more than I ever have been before. The filming decisions of this movie are amazing and really make the movie for me. Never fully showing a room and having the abstract up close shots of the room events are happening in made me feel like I was remembering my childhood. It captured the feeling of remember and what it FELT like to be a kid. Never fully showing the characters and the vagueness of the shots made me feel like this was about me and like I was really there making it all the more horrifying. It felt real and it felt believable. Absolutely amazing movie with wonderful direction truly excelling at creating an essence and a palpable atmosphere of cinema.And as an extra note I really love how this feels like analog horror and I absolutely think of it as that. It doesn't take place within the analog space but uses analog of the 90s as it's centerpiece. It's also very cool to see parallels to the online series that are so popular I'm the analog horror genre with this movie. One that I noticed a lot of similarities to was the Mandela Catalog especially seasons 2 and 3 with the more live action segments. The long atmospheric and dark shots and suspenseful repetition of events feels like a more realized concept of the genre and I love to see it fully realized on the big screen.,2023-01-15
"This movie is definitely different, so if you're in the mood for a standard hollywood horror flick, you might not enjoy it. But if you are seeking something truly out there, give this one a whirl. It is breathtakingly scary.I don't understand other reviewers. Who cares if it's low budget? Does every movie need to be an Avengers-level production for people to enjoy a film now?Does every movie need to have x amount of character development, or this or that etc. Etc.?Apparently, because I still have yet to hear any valid complaints about the movie that are substantial and are backed with any solid criticisms.",2023-02-07
"First of this is not really a horror film. Comparing this to ""Begotten"" is an insult, I've reviewed that a few years back, feel free to go read it. This movie exemplifies the story of the emperor. Yes, this is found footage, calling it Analog horror won't change that. Essentially it is filmed as if a demon imp made a found footage film. That's not a compliment. I firmly believe those who layer on praise to this are like those who can see the emperor is naked but don't want to admit because they think they'll look stupid and will be told the just missing it well you're not. Theirs a fantastic idea here for sure that's it.Although this was clearly a labor of love, it is tedious and boring. There is a lot of attention to detail here, there are also some genuinely unsettling moments here, and it has a creeping dread that settles into you, if you can endure it, and I mean this seriously. Not endure because it is scary, but because it was really hard to get through this movie, it took me nearly a week of watching bits at a time, it was so dull for long stretches. I enjoy weird unconventional films, and I see what this is attempting to achieve. At most like 80 minutes would have been reasonable for this material, not 100!!! It is based off of a 30 minute short film, have not seen that. Kudos to those who like this this is amazing, please be honest, how could you enjoy the so many grainy dark long takes of nothing. No dialog, which does work in some of the scenes, but not as frequently used as it is, it becomes repetitive and boring. You would miss nothing if you cut the very long prolonged shots of carpet or ceiling out to make it 80 minutes, that's how many useless shots there are in this movie. Few of them build tension, that's the problem.I have tons of patience. This movie took about 30 minutes for me to get interested, and then 5 minutes later, I'm bored again. This was so hard to to watch. I got sick and tired of long takes of tops of doors in the dark. Seriously, who wouldn't? There is a way to make this a good movie , the same movie, and still make it without a story, and feature length. I got massively frustrated with the long crooked takes of doorway, floor, ceilings, and lamp tops. It's really pretentious, and it is a stylistic choice that hurts this movie massively. Apparently those shots are so important because it's supposed to be from a child's practice, except if that's the case, we'd still see their dad, and we only see his feet. So no, sorry, your reading something into this that is not there. Pretty sure it's from the practice of a demon imp. I mean we're just throwing out own ideas on it, so why not!?Is it creepy in parts? Yes, it does have some creepy points that build up over the movie, but they are padded or with, again, shots of tops of doors and lamps and ceiling. Such a waste. I can't compare this to Lynch because Lynch doesn't waste shots. This film needed a new editor badly. This movie was very obviously intentionally made this way and in some ways well crafted for it's tone and look, but it needed a Keen and honest eye for editing it, which it clearly did not get.I was creeped out on parts, I'm not going to say it wasn't successful in part, but I could've gotten the same effect by watching a creepy compilation video on YouTube. It is not a masterpiece, and it's not groundbreaking, BUT what I do enjoy is that this being found footage, it really does attempt to take the genre in a new more artistic direction, and that I do applaud, despite it's flaw, it's had enough success, it might work. We will see. I think it will have a because effect on low budget movies and people will attempt to imitate it's style to their own peril.",2023-02-07
"This movie will waste 100 minutes of your life that you could better spend literally doing anything else. It is not scary at all. I'm not sure why they even needed $15,000 to make it. It looks like it was made with $50. The constant pixelation and horrible quality gave me and my husband a horrible headache.I was hopeful that they were going to make an awesome movie because the trailer was so different than mainstream scary movies that stuck. But no.Maybe if you have some unresolved childhood issues you will find it scary.If you have a fetish for Legos, walls, doors, floors, and ceilings, this is the movie for you.",2023-01-14
"I don't care what the critics say, it was a horrible movie. If you like still shots of various parts of the house at a 5' distance, then you may like it. Each shot is looking at something in the house for several minutes without moving, such as a vase, the post of a bed, a few steps in the staircase, corner of a room, etc. You will occasionally see the children, but never their faces. Lighting is dim.The overall story is easy to figure out, but many scenes simply do not make sense, such as the scene with their mother.A strange movie that is a waste of time. You will feel unsatisfied at the end.",2023-02-15
"When I was a kid, I've always been afraid of the dark and the unknown. In my high school years, I was straight up steel. I was never afraid of horror movies or even the dark. Jumping to the present, I'm sort of in the middle. I can get scared but not as scared when I was a kid.Now that I've established where I'm coming from, it was surprising to see the reviews here. I thought the majority of people had similar experiences with the dark. For me, whenever it's like really dark, minimal light in sight, it's like the way the movie is presented. You get slight visions of your surroundings, but then you also start to see other things that may or may not be there. The movie gets that atmosphere exactly. You try to make out things in the dark and get so curious if a jumpscare would come out or if something is there.The audio is great at times but also annoying, especially at dialogues where it isn't accompanied by subtitles. I don't know if people get this whenever there's complete silence, but if it's dark and it's silent, the movie actually captures what I hear in those conditions. There's these static-like noises that pierce through your ears that keeps you unsettled. It's like your senses are heightened because there's no audio and a very impaired visual that you somehow want to hear something and you're raising your hearing sensitivity to hear something from the silence.Now, the plot and story is really thin. It's really more of an experimental movie than an actual movie with story arcs and plot that drives the story. You'll have to put the pieces yourself when watching this movie, which for me, was pretty easy since there's basically little to no story and basically just a paranormal activity.I also saw some reviews complaining that the movie was too dark, but actually it really wasn't, or maybe because I was watching on a bright TV with the brightness turned all the way up, that's why I enjoyed the contrast between the lights reflected and the complete darkness obscured with film grain. So I suggest when watching this movie, probably don't watch it on a dim display or projector, watch with the brightness turned all up.I know that it's not everyone's cup of tea, but like the other positive review here, props to the director for scaring the s*** out of me more than all the horror movies I have ever watched.",2023-05-07
"I would not recommend this movie for several reasons.This movie could have been made by a five year old. The cinematography is horrendous, even for an indie D grade movie. I disliked the odd angles, dark, out of focus and random pointless scenes.I guess the long, no-dialog pauses are to make you keep watching. Don't fall for it.There is essentially no plot; none that I could discern. You mostly see the kids feet walking around and really bad sound effects. One jump scare. The movie made no sense. People are there, then gone.However, if you're into lame homemade movies, go see it and love it.",2023-02-04
"Beginning with Kyle Ball's 25 min. Short, ""Heck"" which has been view online for awhile, it begins a full film, ""Skinamarink$. This film has upset many genre film goers as being seen as an art house approach or ""self indulgent"" that said yes yes, it's a slow burner. Interesting thing, this film went viral online due to a film festival glitch, or maybe it's was a marketing gimmick.Nonetheless, though in it's primal look -- it has great possibilities, mixing different sources, like creepy pasta, it also has potential references like 80s films like ""Don't go in the House"". Yes, jump scares are utilized in a fun way. They work as a series of online short episodes rather than a traditional horror movie format.Also it can suggest the idea of a recent populu notions of ""back rooms"" or even liminal, interdimension spaces.

"I heard the term ""slow burn"" when referring to this film multiple times before seeing it. That term infers there is an actual fire somewhere. There isn't. No plot, no character buildup, nothing. If you enjoy weird camera angles, grainy shots, unintelligible dialogue, and the occasional ear piercing noise...well, this is right up your alley. Initially, I thought it was impressive that the filmmaker was able to do a movie with a 15K budget...now I am left trying to figure out what that money was spent on. I gave it one star, because IMDB doesn't have a zero. People reviewing this gave it nines and tens. Did we view the same movie? Go and watch the trailer, and repeat that for 1:40 minutes. That is Skinamirink in a nutshell. Don't waste your time.",2023-01-16
"Pointless camera shots; ankles, walls, doors, ceilings. Not once do we see the actual actors except for the occasional back shots or feet.Grainy picture coupled with a soundtrack composed of scratchy clicking and old cartoons, got old after about 10 minutes in. Dialogue so soft the editor had to put subtitles in so you could make out the barely audible talking.This film is the product of someone who didn't want to put the effort into it and just paid to have it pushed through some sort of media.This isn't horror, this is just plain horrible.Those of you who got scared watching this probably have meltdowns when a person says ""Boo!""",2023-04-21
"There's no story here. There's nothing going on, and it's 100 minutes of trundling towards the credits. This is a great short film - unfortunately the film isn't short. It's functionally a retelling of the author's film Heck, which stretches its 30 minute runtime. I wish I could recommend this but I just can't. There's unfortunately not very much going on aside from a couple attempts at scares that just fall flat. It uses the same tricks that great Dungeon Masters use - present something, and then when your players make up the story for you, confirm what they thought. It's boring, it's long, and it's ultimately just pretentious crap.",2023-01-15
"I was unsure about this film at first - only 4 actors and looked very arty. Thought it was gonna be very very poor but I was absolutely scared stiff.I must admit it does start off very slow, very confusing and I was going to turn it off. However, I gave it a chance and I'm glad I did. I don't think you're meant to completely understand the story fully, it's very very unsettling and your eyes play tricks on you when you're staring into darkness down a corridor. By the end I was looking through the cracks of my fingers just waiting for something.Definitely give this film a chance! Terrifyingly good.",2022-11-28
"Not sure why it's being called ""innovative"". Dutch angles and weird shots of walls: been done before
Using old film stock: been done before
Still life shots of random objects in scene: been done before
Sudden increase in volume and flashing lights to induce shock factor: been done before
Off camera dialogue: been done beforeEven for an experimental film it was very elementary. The shots either spoke in very simple terms or spoke nothing at all that would add to the ""story"", not symbolically or metaphorically. Reading in between the lines of the dialogue was too easy.The 3-4 ""jump scares"" were not scary at all. It felt surprising, but I didn't walk away scared.If Kyle Edward Ball thinks that this is what nightmares are made of, he must be the kind of guy who gets scared when someone yells ""boo!"" at him during Halloween.A bland buildup of ""tension"" with an even blander punchline.It felt like having sex with a hyped up guy, but when you finally do it, he only thrusts every 30 minutes and even then it wasn't very enthusiastic.",2023-01-15
"So boring that I fell asleep three different times. When awake I decided to turn this into a comedy show people around me were cracking up as I commented on different subtitles that were flashed:
A child wonders ""can we watch something happy""... I yell out Pleeease!! This was 105 minutes about nothing(Seinfeld would have been proud). No actors, no lighting, no plot and zero entertainment or scares. At one point I decided to stand and do a cell phone check. At least 3 people in each row were playing on their phone. I am truly amazed only 2 people actually walked out. Save your $15, Pleeease don't see this film.",2023-01-14
"But... this movie is dogwater. The marketing campaign is obnoxious. The amount of astroturfing from guerilla marketing is ridiculous. The dude had the chance to make something of quality and set his place in the genre/industry, but he basically dropped an hour and 40 minute turd in everyone's mouth. It is a highschool film project level production. Apparently it cost 15k. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie.. This is the equivalent of cinematic idiocracy.Do you like staring at walls? Do you like fake film grain?I would not have the hatred i have towards this film if they werent so aggressive with the fake acclaim.",2022-12-11
"I truly am utterly speechless which is why I am writing this down. Perhaps, because of my age and already being exposed to Blair Witch and Paranormal I was expecting more from this film. Labeling it the ""scariest movie of the year,"" at least gives contenders ample room considering its only Feb. My daughter and I love horror, scary movies, and the one positive caveat, was she was a least ""tense'"" for parts of it, however the sheer slowness of play and payoff was overwhelming unsatisfying. The fact this movie has already made 2M at B. O., gives credence to a well-edited Trailer. I give it 1 star and may Xerxes have mercy on all our poor souls who wasted 1H 40min.",2023-02-07
"15 minutes in we hear the father talking to someone, presumably on the phone, about someone who fell down the stairs, hit his head, is ok and didn't even need stitches.That's the only explanation you'll get for everything that happens afterwards..
The boy feels abandoned by the father - he isn't ok after that fall, after all..did the father even take his son to the ER or just shrug it off? So now we're in the boy's dream and that's why the father is nowhere to be found and the boy can find no way out and nobody to help him, and every scene is symbolic of the fear and isolation the boy is experiencing.",2023-01-15
"What is this movie is about? Horror? No, just nothing. It is so empty. Almost 2 hrs of black screen. Just save yourself time and watch something else. This movie doesn't even deserve to be in theaters. A lot of people are thinking this is a new idea. No, not at all because Blaire witch project and paranormal activity done it before and much much much better. This one is just black screen most of the time and you don't even know what is going on, like should I be scared now because it is dark and there is a sound or it is just plain stupid thing that keeps on repeating itself. Zero plot and zero character development.",2023-02-03
"There is no way to contain spoilers, unless you say this movie contains nothing. Nothing at all. No characters. No script. No plot.Just wow. Seriously, is this supposed to be a joke?Did a family of 4 film this one night goofing around, and it accidentally was shared?I wish I could give a 0 rating... I wish I could get back the worst spent 100 minutes of my life...I have never rated a movie myself before, but felt the need to create an account just to rate this (movie?) to hopefully save anybody from the torture of watching it. I really cannot believe this was actually shown in theaters! Wtf?! I seriously would've questioned the manager if this was some kind of joke and asked for my money back! You literally can't even make out the picture. The whole movie is static, blurry, and dark nothing while it slowly flashes to different views of random items in a house, and occasionally a few people's back or feet. It would be the same as watching a black screen for a 100 minutes, except with the black screen you wouldn't have to strain your eyes and ears through the annoying static sounds and blurry, dark, and absolutely pointless pictures.I'm still in shock that someone actually filmed this and thought it was movie...This is definitely the worst thing I have ever seen. I'm not sure how it made the horror category either, which is why I decided to watch it. There is no movie, and nothing happens, so where does the horror categorization stem from? It honestly looks like a ""scary"" video a 3-yr old would make on a phone to show their parents, and unfortunately keeps going and going and going. You would feel more satisfied with your 100 minutes doing literally ANYTHING else! Take a nap. Please don't waste your time!",2023-01-27
"This collection of still images is one of the most boring ""movies"" I've ever watched. It's more akin to a radio program than a film. However if you like the sound of someone digging in a toy box while watching old cartoons, this might be the movie for you.I'm always skeptical when something is a Shudder original as only The Sadness and Deadstream were really worth the watch but the internet made this seem like it might be another good one. It wasn't. It's a slog and I stopped it several times to see how much runtime was left and to debate if it was worth it to continue. Spoiler, at no point was this worth continuingSave yourself the time, watch the trailer, it contains all the interesting parts and you don't have to waste 100 minutes wondering when something is going to happen.",2023-02-03
"Never thought I could describe a movie as tense, yet boring at the same time. It has a few great sequences and great scares. It's nothing like you've ever seen before. It also captures the essence of a nightmare quite accurately. My nightmares never have clear faces. With Skinamarink, you never see the faces of any of the characters, which was an interesting choice that made the movie feel nightmarish.With that said, I can very much see this movie resonating and capturing a subset of horror fans. I can also see why some people thought it was boring. However for me, I am somewhere in the middle with this one. At any moment, I thought something was going to jump out, leaving me feeling unsettled the whole time. Which was something not often captured for as long of a time as this movie did. But most of the time, we are ultimately just staring at the ceiling.I think if this movie was maybe 10-20 minutes shorter, and had just something a little extra (not sure what specifically) it'd be a masterpiece. But in its current form, I'm going to place it as a slight misfire. But pay respect where it's due: I love that this type of experimental movie exists and is getting a somewhat wide theater release. More please.",2023-01-18
"I have never in my 40 years of watching movies, especially horror movies have I witnessed something new. So this movie brought me some original experiences. During this ""movie"" I was shocked by the films ability to have 11 people leave the theater after less than 30 minutes. And when the lights came on the single comment: ""Are you kidding me?!"" was the best part of the experience.Based on the synopsis it's a chilling story, but all you hear is heavy annoying static. And muffled voices saying random things. None of the story connects in any way. From the opening scene about a kid falling but not needing stitches, it was 30 minutes of B roll footage of dressers and hallways.There were a total of 3 jump scares. One was good, they could have used it to build an antagonist. The second was a toy phone that only made you jump because of how loud it was. And the third one lost it's ""jump"" factor to repeating the scene numerous times.It felt like a film student submission from 1995 that was the best out of a stack of turds. The films audio was so bad they had to add subtitles. I believe the entire movie's dialogue was: ""dad?"", ""Kevin?"", ""Keely?"", ""Look under the bed"", and ""I want to play.""
If found footage movies were a trend, I truly hope old VHS movies don't become a trend. You don't see a single face and there is no literal story or attempt to build a story.",2023-01-15
"This movie left a Mark on my psyche. Wowsers. Skinamawhoaaaa is its spiritual name in my book.It is very much an art film, and it uses mostly your own brain to scare the crap out of you. It focuses on white noise and long, still shots to the point that at first you will think you are bored and wonder why you wasted your time.But then these sounds and still as can be frames start to mesmerize you in a very haunting way and then comes the scary things and sounds, subtly, and I do mean subtly as subtlety is what the movie uses best, and by the last shot you are so mind blown that you are beyond regretting turning out all the lights before it started. You are now at the point where you are scared to get off the couch and you are seeing and hearing these scenes and sounds that are in every home.Then, light cannot come soon enough, if you have the guts to walk around in what now looks and feels like the home you spent 90 minutes watching. Terrifying in a way I have never experienced from a movie, and while every individual experience will be different because of how the movie uses your own fears and feelings against you, every experience will share the basic concept of real fear. Yikes.I highly recommend this head trip of a movie, one of the cheapest ever made when compared to its profits, but every penny put to genuinely original use. Two !?!?s up.",2023-04-05
"I guess I'll remember it.This is the worst waste of screen time in 40 years. Sit in front of a snowy screen and wait to have a seizure, maybe. I didn't walk out because I never have and I didn't want to break that record.Here's the pitch: ""it's a silent film, right. A silent film but your watching the floor and ceiling on snowy grainy film. It's a silent movie without video basically. Right?!""On the one hand this is the worst film ever. On the other, if this made mainstream your lethargic and uninspired movie can, too. I feel like it is a psych experiment to see who would lie and champion this film if someone was told it was art.

"My lovely boyfriend suggested this movie he found through TIKTOK APP. This film was the equivilant of licking grandmas undercarriage for an hour and fourty minutes. The cinematography had potential, but so did communism. Not everything that has potential works out. No wonder this film didn't get picked up. The film did however, make me want to pick up my prozac prescription from the walgreens. No amount of prozac can fix the fecal fest that i have just endured. This movie plays like trying to read tea leaves in a cup of diarrhea. This movie is what we need to make inmates watch before the electric chair. The plot, however, had potential. That is why there is one star. I could not hear anything, this movie made me senile. There is nothing I want more than to take back that time and drop a deuce in the toilet. Do NOT waste your time. Much love. <3.",2022-11-27
"Skinamarink walks on a thin line since it requires much from its viewers. The experimental nature of this movie can come off as boring or laughable to others, and downright terrifying for others.Rather than having a full, cohesive narrative, it instead opts for a more unconventional approach to its storytelling which can feel frustrating, and to some extent, it is because it presents a series of vignettes. Vignettes that don't last very long, are random and don't even show our characters in frame most of the time, but that's exactly what works for it. It fills the camera with that negative space that the viewer wants to avoid looking at, maybe something is lurking there. There's not a lot of dialogue either, we get noises, sounds, and one or two pieces of dialogue in what feels like every 10 minutes. It seems as if the intention here is to trap the viewer in its feverish nightmare, through the eyes of the two children.It reminds me of the creepypastas and those strange, viral ""ghost caught on tape"" videos that were so prominent on youtube in the 2010s. But this time it's turned into a feature-length film and I have to give it props for what it's trying to achieve on such a low budget. But this way of storytelling also proves to be a major detriment to the film itself. You need to be really immersed in order for it to work, you need to be patient, give it your undivided attention throughout its runtime, and just let it work on its own. And then maybe, you'll experience the nightmare for yourself.",2023-09-09
"Many people will uncomfortably attempt to watch Skinamarink. This is the best example of divisive film making in recent years, it will only be appreciated by experimental film fanatics and ambient horror lovers.The grainy shots and faceless characters will leave some viewers wanting more. Those techniques are crucial for the experience of discomfort and first person perspective of the situation that main characters find themselves in.A very important part of the stylistic choice made in Skinamarink is having most of the film distorted and ambiguous. Much like a child's perspective of life, the viewer is left to their interpretation of situations and images based on the limited information presented.8/10 Instant favorite experimental horror film.",2023-07-08
"Pretty much what you see in the trailer, it's the whole movie.I don't need a well-drawn story or completed ending or full CGI effects. This is purely garbage. The camera man just filmed the ceiling, darkness, and objects in the room. I can understand him wanting to create an atmosphere of fear....but what the hell am I looking at? A wall, a toy phone.... He could have at the very least shown the kids face to see the fear and confusion and it would have told the story there. Instead I am lucky if I see the back of a kid's head. Don't waste your time. This is the worst version of an art film. Doesn't deserve any attention.",2023-04-28
"If you want to watch at home just open your eyes in a dark room for nearly 2 hours and you've just seen Skinamarink. Characters? Who? Plot? Where? Scares? Check 2010s creepy pastas and volume screeches at 400%. It's hard to even write a scathing review because it is so hollow empty and meaningless. The opening credits is the most action packed sequence in the whole film and it's a long shot of a hallway and you see a boy sitting on the floor and the moms feet walk away. The next hour and thirty five mines is sparsely narrated by an unintelligible toddler between 5 mins of silence and still shots of extremely zoomed in corners of this house. Not even kidding 90% of this movie is zoomed in still shots of the corner ceiling of a room. Nothing is compelling, no characters are worth worrying about. Nothing makes sense and you are left in an internal fit of rage for having sat through the very definition of self indulgent meaninglessness.",2023-01-23
"Can I give it zero stars??? Literally the worst movie I have ever seen. Not sure where the hype came from. Some things were tied together, most were not. The movie was entirely too long, no connection to the characters, and within the first 30 minutes I was looking at my watch wondering when the misery would end. It was clear after the first 30 minutes the movie was not salvageable.... I was hopeful at the beginning that something---anything--would make sense or that perhaps I would care about Kevin and Kaylee, but nope! They should show this movie as a sentencing option instead of giving criminals prison time. Just awful.",2023-01-16
"My expectation exceeded reality. I was really looking forward to this. That I almost decided I liked it before watching it. Hence, the crushing disappointment.Respect the efforts of any filmmaker producing a piece of art but this slow burn was Way. Too. Slow.Not a lot happens. Just staring at the ceiling and intermittent whispering. If you're hard of hearing, you'll need to watch this with subtitles on.Kids (especially little kids) scream their lungs out if there's a shadow outside the window.They don't calmly wake their sibling, grab pillows and quietly watch cartoons as windows disappear, toys float midair ... AND they can't find their parents. (Remember when you lost your mom in the supermarket? And you cried till you couldn't breathe?)Back to the film, you're staring at the ceiling and you can't really see or hear what's going on - found footage style. Great to create fear of the unknown.But after an hour of dark ceilings, I may have dozed off. Woke up and there was one child less. After more ceilings, he too disappeared. End credits.I agree with prev review, this would have made a great short story.",2023-01-20
"Especially if you like obvious horror. Just move on, watch something else. You won't find that here.This is what true dread and rising terror feel like; this film felt very reminiscent of the night terrors I had around Kevins' age (four)...never really knowing whether what I was seeing/hearing/feeling was reality or dream, friend or foe, and certainly unsure of wtf was actually happening. The natural unsophistication of that young age make one easy prey for 'unnarural'... shenanigans. Those 'dreams' I still recall as though it were last night, not decades ago.The slow build of dread, the experimental camera angles (I'm guessing the skewed perception of seeing through Kevin and Kaylees' eyes?) and the circa-'95 video fuzz will likely not impress everyone. It's *meant* to make those shadows unclear and unfocused...am I really seeing something? Is there someone there? You begin to see...shapes or faces, that's just how the brain works. It wants to make sense of the nonsensical.That all being said, both my partner and myself found it deeply disturbing and the final scene an emotional d*ckpunch that stayed with me throughout the weekend and into today. I initially told my bf that it felt rather like a Michel Gondry feverdream. Except it wound up much more unsettling than that. Oof.***I don't really rate a film on production values, or any of the usual things that people think are important, though I do appreciate those things ie: the music in Sinister....still gives me chills, and will mention them. Really, it's how it makes me feel. And this was effective. I appreciated the microbudget feel here, and those very cartoons I remember as a kid, being slowly distorted and detuned....gah.

"To be robbed of $5-20....or more if you unfortunately brought a date.This was the most painful movie I've ever had to sit through. NOTHING happens! I thought nothing happened in Paranormal Activity but that was an action packed thrilled compared to this movie. My fiance managed to fall asleep twice during the movie.When the movie ended, we could hear people all around us describing the ""hot garbage"" they just paid to watch.I'm pretty sure this was an experiment to see if people will willingly pay and sit through almost 2 hours of random shots of a house and small bits of dialogue with nothing going on.I will say this, if you like random shots of floors, ceilings, kids legs and small clips of cartoons... Then your going to love this movie!",2023-01-14

Get up and leave and don't waste any more time watching this utter TRASH. You'd be better off closing your eyes for two hours and watching nothing. This was such an assault on my eyes even though all of the movie was basically watching stills of corners of walls. Literally ANY movie would be better than this. And I mean ANY movie. Theres nothing scary or disturbing about the movie. It's dark and stupid and for three seconds loud and stupid.",2023-01-14
"It's been a few days, maybe a week, since I watched this, and I have to say...this is one that's stayed with me! Most flashier or more in-your-face horror doesn't stay with me, but subtle, creepy things like this absolutely do!I like the theories about it regarding how the little boy is likely in a coma. This would explain why he and his sister are ""trapped"" in the house, and the windows and doors disappear. It would explain a lot of other things, too. However, I'm not sure it's a story of parental abuse; it's entirely possible the poor kid just lost his footing and fell down the stairs. But, on that note, I don't know what the bone-crunching sounds of his mom while she's moaning in pain would amount to. (Clearly, there's been or was planning to be some kind of divorce. Whether that happened or not is ambiguous at best.)This is another slow psychological movie, and I think it perfectly captures the confusion a child feels or might feel about some kind of very dramatic and adult situation. It's how they would make sense of it.That being said, I do wish some answers were given. Who was the person with the fuzzy face at the end? Could it have been a nurse? A guardian angel? Dead mom? LIVING mom, as the kid is coming out of the coma? It's hard to say.Were the Face and the Voice the same thing? Or were those two different things? Why does the toy ""house"" have windows and doors, but the real one does not? Could the kids be ghosts? Or is the little boy in a coma?Anyroad, this gets right to the deepest fears of Being Left Alone and Not Knowing What Is Happening. Even as adults, I think this is a deep-seeded fear, and in some ways, little kids can handle it better than most adults because they're used to not understanding how things work, and making up their own reasons (real or imagined) as to what is happening and why.It makes one think.And if you're like me, it will stay with you, for a while.",2023-08-26
"This movie is absolutely terrible. I've watched a ton of horror in the IMDb 4.5 and up range and this movie is just a complete waste of time. There isn't anything at all about this movie that is interesting or suspenseful. I've seen a few terrible movies in my day, but this one is a special kind of terrible. The kind that wants you to think it's way more intellectual and thought out than it really is. This movie was painful to watch in every way. Hey maybe if we make it look like it was shot on a crappy camera from 1987 and put some old black and white cartoons on, the spookiness will come naturally. Awesome idea, let's go all in on that and that alone!",2023-02-06

"This was a VERY poor attempt at an artistic view of horror. Extremely thin plot. No conflict, climax or resolution. A quarter of the time you will be looking at a grainy black screen. Half the time you'll just be staring at the floor or ceiling. The entire movie was plagued with poor audio. Sometimes subtitles were provided. Other times, you are left to interpret gargled mumbling. The grainy film filter was overused. The POV made little to no sense. I do t know about the rest of the world, but I don't want around looking at the floor or ceiling. You will find more enjoyment watching traffic lights. I very rarely dislike a movie. This is something that should have never been out in theaters. Save yourself the headache and money. Skip.",2023-01-20
"I seriously cannot understand how this movie doesn't have more bad reviews. I sat in the theater baffled at how I hadn't seen any warning about how frighteningly dull this movie really is.If you enjoy staring at the tops of doorways, an unmoving hallway wall, legos, and an old childeren's cartoon, then this is going to be the most thrilling 100 minutes of your life, now if that doesn't sound fun to you, then you're with me.From what I can tell from others, it seems that people find this to be a ""Horror genre changing movie"" but instead of action in this new form of genre we're gearing toward awful visuals, literal minutes of nothing on screen and no audio other than a god awful static. The whole movie looks as if it were filmed on a literal brick which makes it nauseating to watch and have I already mentioned the static noise? Let me mention it again, it gets old really fast.You may ask what about any of these things relates this frighteningly dull movie to anything in a horror genre. After maybe an hour you get your first ""jumpscare"" which is one of the kids screaming at a toy and blowing out the mic. Now, we don't really see either of the children or the parents through the movie as the whole thing is told by minimal dialogue as the camera focuses on one of the seven different walls or sets they have in the movie.I was genuinely about to fall asleep several times from the dark and uninteresting visuals only disturbed by a one off phrase or something like the television playing which kept me from really falling asleep. Honestly this could have been released as an audio file played over a blank screen and one would have the same experience listening as I did watching it.There are parts where the movie will rewind the same scene, then play it forward again, then rewind, and so on which honestly feels sloppy and lazy. It feels like there was maybe 15 to 30 minutes worth of content and the rest is pure padding, and not the kind to make you suspenseful, but rather like a rollercoaster that doesn't climb or doesn't drop, simply going around a level circle.If I weren't at a theater with family I would have walked out after maybe 7 minutes. I know for a fact if it was put on at home, we would have gotten 5 minutes in, realized you can't see anything, given it another 2 to get better and then turned it off.I really tried to give this movie a chance, but in the end it was obvious why me and my two family members were the only ones in the theater. I expect more from a movie, even one with that low of a budget. If you think that staring at walls and doorframes in the dark is for you, at least save yourself the money from a ticket and just do it at home.",2023-01-15
"The movie tries to set the atmosphere very specifically and hard. All I'll grant is it was mostly ""unique"". We see and hear almost nothing of the characters, the movie is composed mainly of (slow), grainy camera pans. You spend a great deal of time looking at inanimate objects, floors and walls. I would suppose it's trying to set a tone of nostalgia and present ""horrors"" from the perspective of children, but mostly nothing happens. The pace is so exceeding slow and there's so much nothing between momentary somethings it's hard to find reason to pay attention. What dialogue exists is drawn out, do we really need a 30 second plus gap between EVERY response time?Some creepy and eerie elements for sure, but so much mind-numbing NOTHING between actual content does the movie no favours. With a little more goings on or some time trimming, a more engaging pace might have been accomplished.Very hard to watch and does not live up to the hype. Would not recommend, couldn't wait for it to be over, would never sit through it again. Felt I had to finish to make sure there's no big payoff to this time sucker, rest assured there isn't. It could've had some creepy, standing-in-corner Blair Witch flair scare to it but it just couldn't get there. Extremely disappointing.",2023-02-05
"Tl;dr: See above.This review isn't worth six hundred characters. This movie felt like it was six hundred hours long. I got a headache watching it. Pretentious art house movie that is ripping off of Wavelength, an equally boring pretentious art house structuralist movie from the sixties.The positive part of this movie was that I really wanted to play with the legos. I also think I heard the ghost farting about half way through the movie, and given the fact that the toilet disappears I actually felt pretty bad for this ghost.They really need to clean the house. That is my personal observation.Now I am just typing to fill up the word count just like this movie had superfluous shots of the floor and ceiling to fill up its agonizing 140 minute length.Need to sleep? This is movie is better than Ambien.Good job separating people from their dollars to the tune of two million.",2023-02-05
"I'm ambivalent about whether or not the filmmakers possess talent, vision, or were simply lucky enough to find someone to finance this...attempt. I understand what the camera is trying to do with the grainy focus, and the long takes in which nothing actually happens. I remember as a child looking at the open closet door in my dark bedroom at 2:00 a.m. And having the exact same feeling. Staring into the abyss, and all that. There are a lot of vibes like that in this film. Definitely, there's a mood. But there's not enough meat on the bones, so to speak. Brooding, foreboding, and eerie don't necessarily make a film by themselves. I don't mind asking questions and or trying to figure things out myself, but there's zero narrative structure here. There are certainly nods to ""Blair Witch Project"" - without a doubt. Another reviewer mentioned similarities to the novel ""House of Leaves,"" and I completely agree. But even though the concept was interesting, I don't think the screenplay (what there was of one) was ready to go yet. Given more time, an attempt at some sort of storyline, and shaving a few minutes off and you'd have a good movie, and well worth watching. As it is, it's just empty, and you sit watching, waiting for something to happen that never does. The artsy folks out there are going to dig this, and the slasher fans are going to hate it, but I'm neither and I think it just falls flat.",2023-02-20
"Tonight I watched The Thing, Halloween, and I just finished Skinamarink. Sorry John Carpenter, but this film creeped me out far more than your legendary classics (which I love). This was a chilling film experience and one that I will never forget. I reallllllllly don't understand the terrible rating it has. This is a very unique and unsettling work of art and a must see for any true fan of horror. It is very intense, but at the same time, very slow. If you have zero attention span and can't practice a little patience, you will not like this film nor will you be able to make it to the end. Go watch a Marvel movie or scroll whatever social media platform you are addicted to instead. This is a very impressive modern horror film and one that I do not regret investing time in. Give it a chance, but remember to practice patience!",2023-10-22
"I gave this experimental film every advantage I could think of - watched it late at night, alone, and with complete focus. It paid off in a strange way that filled me with incredible dread without relying on a narrative. Without a narrative or characters, the visuals are the only thing going here - they are creepy as hell. However, I agree that what is demanded of the audience is to essentially stare into the dark & strange corners of a house for 90 minutes or whatever. This is something you can demand once; I will probably never watch it again. This is better described as an experience than a movie, and while it was very enjoyable it's not for everyone.",2023-03-05
"What can I even say? Ever since my first genuine scare from watching a horror movie, I have been chasing that dragon. There's a movie that comes around maybe once in a decade that brings me back to being a terrified child watching my first scary movie. This is the movie of the decade.From my experience, there's two types of horror movies. The horror movie that scares you while watching it, and the scary movie that lingers and makes it hard to fall asleep. This movie is the latter.I don't want to overhype this movie but... Wow. The person I watched this movie with explained it perfectly with the word ""agonizing"".This movie is a slow burn in the best possible way. It gives you just little enough stimulation that it allows you to go delve into your own mind and pull from your experiences to fully immerse yourself into the movie.",2022-12-09
"WOW!I've always considered Alien Vs Predator: Requiem to be the worst film ever made. I've seen all of the other Alien films multiple times (even Covenant which is also terrible) but AvP:R was so bad that I've never watched it again. Not even when it was on TV and I happened to turn the channel over just as it started.Well, by some margin, Skinamarink is now the worst film ever made.After 10-15 minutes you'll be wondering if things will get better as, up to that point, all that has happened is that the camera has been pointed at the ceiling or in various empty corners of uninteresting rooms.There's no sense of plot. The characters are meaningless. You're aware that there's a mother and father and maybe a couple of kids. None of them have anything to say or do.Instead you just see static cameras cut from one to another, never showing anything of interest. Why? Because nothing ever happens of interest. Barely anything ever happens at all. It's like the director saw Blair Witch and wondered how he could make something infinitely worse.The basic blurb of the film describes it as two children waking up in a house with no windows or doors and their parents have disappeared. But even that represents far more content than the film ever offers up.For a film to even really qualify as a film, something needs to happen. And if it does happen (which is arguably not the case here) then the film has really three jobs. It needs to show you it. You need to be able to hear it (at least if you can't see it). And the film then needs to reference or acknowledge it.But instead when anything does happen, the film just cuts to something else. Not that anything did happen as really you were probably either looking at a ceiling or at the corner of a TV playing an old cartoon. Those two things take up probably half this film's astonishingly empty hundred minute runtime.Honestly, this is pure awfulness. But like in the worst way. It's time wasting awfulness. It's not even clever or accomplished enough to be pretentious. After 30 minutes of it, you just know that nothing is going to happen or be resolved.And if it wasn't for me turning on actual subtitles (the film has some hard subs in there), I wouldn't have a clue as to what most of the noises or voices were in this film.It's a film that has no point, no characters, no content, no meaning worth exploring, no sense of time (apart from when the film tells you the story is over 500 days in but that's as throwaway as saying that outside this sealed house they're in Kansas or Croydon or wherever).The ending, which is basically nothing, isn't even all that annoying because there's nothing to actually sum up. It can't be a cliffhanger if there's no cliff or hanging or even a world where nouns like 'cliff' or verbs like 'hang' even really need to exist. In this film there's just Lego, old cartoons and ceilings. Just ceilings all the way down. Rubbish ceilings.",2023-07-29
"What is even happening? Why am I watching this? Why is there no hook 15 minutes into a 100 minute movie? 15% of the time has elapsed, and I don't know why I am supposed to care about the random cuts on my screen.I heard good things. Reviews had described it as being the essence of what a YouTube ghost video rabbit hole feels like at 2 am. While I can admit that's not anything I'm familiar with, as a horror fan those words had me intrigued. I kept telling my wife ""give it a few more minutes"" - but every few minutes nothing had happened.I don't know who this exists for or why. Try again my friends.",2023-02-09
"I have seen movies for many decades without posting any reviews, but it's necessary now because favorable reviews by critics are WAY off the mark. Don't waste your time or money on this one. It is an original concept and could have been a great 5-minute movie, but its current form, the movie is a disaster. For a time, I enjoyed being immersed in the movie's white noise, grainy video, and general sense of disorientation. But that got old fast, and Skinamarink offered little else over its 1 hour, 40-minute run time. After endlessly repetitive shots of Lego bricks, a flickering TV screen, a couch, a corner, etc., you can almost sense the filmmakers grasping at straws to keep things interesting (a few jump scares, deafening white noise, a lengthy montage of a wall rising, etc.), but it's too little and too late to save this movie, which should never have been made in its current form. The ending was abrupt and contrived and you get the idea that the filmmakers had no idea what they were trying to do or say. The best thing you can say about the ending is that the unpleasant experience of viewing this movie was at last over and you can now resume your life. Several audience members left before the movie ended, and many of those who stayed made some derisive comments about the movie on the way out. Don't do this to yourself.",2023-01-22
We didn't last 15 mins of grainy video and random blurred house images. My partner watched on his own at a later time and said it should have just been a five minute YouTube video! Only the very ending was worth the time. I think so much hype is put in horror movies to be new and unique when the only point of watching a horror movie is to be scared out of minds. Not be bored to death with a impending headache from watching nuclear dark 1995 video footage. I was really excited too after all the media hype but this one just didn't hit it for me. I'm apparently not alone in my opinion. I recommend a clearer picture and shorter version if anyone is looking for suggestions on how to fix this clear miss of a horror movie.,2023-02-09
"Just my opinion: Seriously? This is the most boring story I've ever sat through. I kept waiting for the movie to really get started. Never happened. Some say abstract, I think pretentious with this one, big time! Or maybe they're just seeing who'll bite no matter how ridiculous the premise. For me it was akin to watching paint dry for the most part. Even when paint is drying there's the occasional bubble that pops to break up the monotony like in this movie. I think they're taking the mickey out of 'someone '. It didn't keep me riveted in any way. Had to rewind many times because my thoughts would wander due to boredom. I kept waiting to feel scared or something akin to it at least. I wouldn't have had a clue what might be happening if I hadn't read an intro. I watched it only because a friend is going to watch it another time and we plan to share notes just for fun which is a movie thing we like to do together. Sounded great but...",2023-02-21
"This is something that not everyone will enjoy.It's a very unique movie and something many people will say is boring and not scary.But for me this was one of the most scariest movie experiences i've had in a long time.Mostly told in stills and with imagery that tries to capture the fear of children's fear of the dark corners of a room, the unknown under a bed, the dark hallway on the way to get something to drink.I went in with nothing knowing about the story except the basic knowledge of what the scariness is about.I can't even tell anymore what this was really about but this is something you need to see to believe.Either you hate it or you love it but for me this is one of the best if not the best horror movie i've seen in the last 10 years.I'd recommend it to everyone who can watch movies that have a sense of a fear for the unknown and the patience to observe a house that has not been cleared of ghosts yet.10/10 for people with enough time and patience.",2023-01-22
"While I myself won't find it worth repeated viewing, it's worth a watch for dedicated horror aficionados because, whether you like the movie or not, it is trying to do something somewhat different and interesting. My favorite aspect of the movie are the lingering low light / low resolution shots of objects and angles, which I experienced as impressionistic still shots. Pretty cool, and very unusual in this genre.There are several creepy and interesting moments throughout the film, but the film's shortcomings ultimately make it less than it could have been. Ironically, one of the main reasons it's less than it could have been is that it is simply too long. I am a fan of methodically paced horror movies - Val Lewton's famous 1940s cycle for RKO, Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock, practically every British horror movie of the '50s and '60s - but once Skinamarink establishes its style it does the same thing over and over and over, particularly for the first hour, introducing new tidbits too infrequently. I know other people experienced this as increasing tension and a growing sense of unease. It had the opposite effect on me.Another stylistic choice, while interesting, is ultimately a detriment to the movie. We see very little of the characters, and when we do it is almost always from the shins down. This choice makes it very difficult to connect with the characters and almost impossible to feel any empathy. To be clear, this film is intended to be neither character-driven nor plot-driven; but because for me it also failed at what is presumably it's primary intent - creepy, atmospheric impressionism? - due to its repetitiveness and self-defeating long running time, while I always appreciate someone trying to do something different, it is not a movie I could sit through a second time.Two additional annoyances: the film occasionally employs subtitles. This is fine, but it is done inconsistently and there are several moments when I simply couldn't make out what was said. I'm actually wondering whether the subtitles being intermittent was another offbeat stylistic choice, but I'm not even willing to give them the benefit of the doubt on that point. It was irritating. Also, there are several really irritating moments of jarring and gratingingly loud aural ""jump scares,"" such as sudden, obnoxiously loud static. It isn't scary or effective as a device; it's an eye-rollingly dumb and annoying horror movie cliche.So ultimately, while there are some interesting aspects to the film, it is too irritating and monotonous to live up to the web hype.",2023-01-24
"I would like to believe that I am very open minded when it comes to what is called an experimental film. But only the most pretentious of hipsters can give this movie the praises it has received. The trailer definitely sold me, it seemed like this movie was reminiscent of the feeling when I woke up from a scary dream when I was 5. As an adult the only thing that's scarier is being painfully bored for two straight hours. I get the movie was made under huge restrictions, but make something ENTERTAINING. I'd hard recommend a movie like Demon Dolls, shot with no budget in one house over this tripe.",2023-03-24
"Do you enjoy looking at dark, grainy, poorly-composed and sometimes repeated shots of ceilings, floors, televisions, Legos, and children's legs for minutes at a time?Do you enjoy bad, sparse, and unintelligible dialogue?Do you enjoy a vague plot so vague that 100 people can all confidently say the movie is about something totally different?Do you get frightened by your own imagination and need a blank canvas onto which you can project literally anything if you try hard enough?Or, more realistically, do you enjoy telling other people you're sophisticated because you routinely give vague compliments to the media most people abhor and tell them they ""just don't get it?""Congratulations. ""Skinamarink"" is the movie for you. But I personally wish I'd walked out after the first 10 minutes. I would have, had I known it doesn't get any better.",2023-02-24
"Couldn't make it through the first 20 minutes, and I really tried. I wish it was because it was so horrifying, but alas, it was just completely unwatchable. I've watched some bad ones the whole way through too...looking at you Blood Vessel :)I did fast forward through and sort of scan the film, the whole movie was exactly the same, awful, unwatchable mess. Maybe it's some kind of groundbreaking directorial technique, but it was not for me. Would have been easier to digest had it been a short.My brother is also a horror fan and he made it to thirty minutes, so it has that going for it I guess.",2023-02-18
One of the most difficult and painful experiences of my life was watching this movie. It was so dark and grainy that I legitimately did not want to look at the screen. The audio was just as bad. The characters would say the most unintelligible things and there were only captions half the time. The trailer looked great but ended up being so misleading. The story should have just been told in a five minute short film instead of a full length movie (calling this a movie is a stretch- it is merely a bunch of poor quality videos put together) The concept was so cool and this served it no justice whatsoever. Do not waste your time or money on this movie. Just watch the trailer and call it a day.,2023-01-23
"Meet Skinamarink!! The first and only motion picture to guarantee a good night sleep or your money back.Let's start off by saying, this isn't a movie. And I mean it, this may be labeled a movie because it was shot with a video camera, but it's not a movie. This is over an hour and a half of still video images of the interior of a house with about 30 words of total dialogue from a toddler! There are no actors other than seeing some feet and hearing a couple voices once in a while. The video shots are not composed correctly on purpose as you never see anything except for maybe a ceiling, door jam, stair railing, wall outlet, toy on the floor, top of a closet, bed pillow, half of a tv, etc etc etc.Now on to the plot... supposedly two kids wake up and their dads not home and there's no windows or anything. I'm not sure how the audience would ever know this since there's literally zero dialogue and the camera never shows the audience a single thing. I had to come here to see what this garbage was even about and still I don't get it.The real question is, how did this cost $15K to make? I could have shot this in a about 2 hours and edited it 3.Let's just hope this loser of a director never gets his hands on another camera again.",2023-04-09
"Struggling to find the words. For me, the films felt like more of an art installation. The mainstream theater didn't seem like the right venue for this.It would make great supporting footage to a feature. However, it did not feel right (to me) as a standalone feature. It's reminiscent of the video (support footage) used to terrify viewers within The Ring film.Maybe it was meant to feel torturous, but it was a bit disconcerting to realize that whatever I thought was an amazing intro was going to last for the duration of the film. So... wow. It's such great footage and I just know there is a better use for it than a typical theater feature presentation.",2023-02-02
"I am the type that will enjoy some aspect of any movie... This movie just did not cut it. The idea was different and could have been great if another writer, editor, sound engineer, and director would've taken on this random fever dream of Kyle Edward Ball. I feel as if this was an attempt at a movie but the director just kept falling asleep leaving the cameras rolling by accident. As the dolly inches down each of the longest hallways I've ever seen in a house, someone decided, this is ""experimental"" let's keep it. I have only really hated 2 movies, this is not one, I'm just disappointed. I'm sorry, but I did, I tried so hard.",2023-08-08
"Let me start this review off by stating that what you see in the trailer is EXACTLY what you get in the movie. That normally sounds like a good thing when determining if you'd like to watch a movie, but this movie is heavily reliant on these unorthodox camera angles that come off as unique at the start, but quickly gets frustrating within the first quarter of the movie. The whole point is to provide you with as little visual information as possible so that you listen to the sounds more, and create an image in your head of what is happening. The problem though is that sitting through almost two hours of that feels like an absolute slog. One of my major concerns with this movie is that I do not recommend people spend money to go see this movie, but the film is so heavily reliant on audio queues and very faint visual queues, that you'd be missing out if you didn't watch it in theaters. This would've been much better as a 45min short film.",2023-01-14
"I was always curios about what made Skinamarink the most disturbing horror experience, i actually had to wait a couple of months the have it distributed here in Italy but, when i finally i had it, i fell asleep in the first 40 minutes.I tried rewatching it again and after it was over i was pretty uncomfortable sleeping in the dark.Skinamarink is a movie that demands a lot from the audience and that is one of the biggest flaws it has, my personal suggestions is to watch it alone at night and in the dark, maybe on a pretty big screen.It's a movie that needs time, so i can understand that it can't be for every horror fan.It's basically a nightmare recorded with an old camera and that is what really triggers the uneasy feeling for me, as a kid i used tho have way to many nightmares and this movie it's basically the representation to all of them.A really good movie that demands a little bit too much to the viewers.",2023-09-04
"Who directed this? Because i actually never want to see a movie made by them ever again. If you're like me and you're looking up if this movie ever gets better while you're 15 minutes in...? Let me tell you, it doesn't. I wanted to gouge my eyes out like kailee in the movie, but i couldn't stay awake long enough to do it. At least kailee got to do it. This was worse than when you have type in your password when your face ID on ur phone wont work. I would rather sit in a pitch black room alone listening to nickel back for 24 hours straight. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING THIS MOVIE. Unless u like staring at legos for an hour with camera footage that is one mega pixel. If you want to watch the movie then just watch the trailer because that's pretty much it.",2023-04-04
"I won't lie that it's not any other horror movie, or any other movie at all. The pacing is slow, stretched out and absolutely unnerving. The story leaves a lot to guessing, which is absolutely perfect to incite horror. All I'll say is this: I've watched horror movies for the last decade just wishing one would scare me like they used to. This was the first time in a long time where I was genuinely scared, wanting for a movie to end so bad but still not being able to look away. If you're bored of Hollywood horror movies, this is your film. I hope this is the future of horror movies, because this makes me hopeful.",2023-02-23
"The only scary part of the movie was that i was able to sit through it without walking out or falling asleep. The guy that created this (kyle edward ball) should be ashamed 🤦‍♀️ this was his first movie and hopefully his last.. no plot, no purpose, nothing. I want my 2 hours of life back now. U can't say this is the worst movie you've ever seen because this can't even be classified as a movie. This is like a skit a 4th grader made in 10 minutes. It's just 2 hours of wall corners, outlets, tv's, legos, and doors. It's the same 20 clips repeating in random orders the entire time. It was a waste of time.

"Knew nothing about this movie going into it, but since it was listed under Hulu's ""very scary"" recommendations my wife put it on. 10 minutes later she turned it off. Since we didn't finish it and don't intend to, I can't fairly give it a star rating. What I can say with a degree of confidence (particularly after reading reviews of the people who did finish it) is that this is not for a mainstream audience. It seems like people who are fans of artsy, experimental films really enjoy this. If that's you then this might be up your alley. If not, know what you're getting into before you waste your time.",2023-10-04
"This movie is an embarrassment to the horror genre.There was nothing different about it like so many say.The whole thing was just a nonsensical mess.I'm always looking for something other than the typical slasher stuff because that's all been done
a thousand times, but after watching this I'd rather go back to that.I actually dozed off twice from boredom.I mean to each their own I guess, if this is what you call creative and chilling with unique suspense,

"Like most of you, I fell victim to the folly of 'tik tok' reviews and other clickbait of the sort surrounding this film and had believed I stumbled across a gem in this next generation of new-age digital horror. In fact, the scariest part of this whole viewing experience was stumbling through Shudders clunky interface so that I could log in and effectively waste an 1:40 on this abysmal piece of garbage. Even now, I risk waking up late and missing work so that I can write this. This 'movie' is utter nonsense from start to finish and then makes you feel bad for not having some visceral reaction.",2023-06-27
"I'm sad to see the ratings for this film here, as I genuinely loved watching this. I even watched it twice just so my friend could see it on shudder.The scenes are definitely long and drawn out, and for many that can be boring, but for me it kept me uneasy. Every dark corner and pixel of shapes had me worried for my life, because if something lunged out from the darkness, I would have screamed, and that never happens. The movie definitely could have been shortened by a lot, as some scenes are too repetitive and boring, not only that, but some of them don't even convey anything to the viewer. For a more artsy film, you have to observe and gain as much information as you can from each dark corner of the scene, but when there is seemingly nothing TO see, then it becomes more taxing to do so.Even so, the jumpscares were effective, and I don't jump easily. Anything to do with eyes, especially from that darn phone toy, is also horrifying, but not for everyone.The concept and story that was gained in part after reading more online about the film, is incredible as it is sad to think about. Following the experience of two toddlers and how they navigate the own horrors of their home all alone, its perfect for a scary film.",2023-07-11
"I found this movie didn't respect my time and tested my patience to the extreme. I didn't find it at all ""terrifying"". After about 10 or 20 minutes into the movie I found myself saying ""this better not be like this the whole time"". It was. Almost nothing happens the entire movie. There's no plot. It's just pure setting. Pure. Boring. Setting.I don't think I get what the director was trying to do. Either it's supposed to invoke a sense of being a helpless child in the face of some all-powerful evil, or the director is trying to get viewers to think there's more here, artistically, when really it's just designed to waste people's time.If you like to be entertained by films, you will probably find this one as horrible as I did. If you're scared of the dark, then maybe you'll be scared by this movie. In my opinion, it's all buildup and no payoff.",2022-12-12
"Man, I wanted to like this movie so bad! After 30min into the film there was maybe 30 words spoken and the most you'll see is the top of doorways and obscure, grainy shots and angles. There's an eerie vibe to the film (through filter and sound techniques) but outside of that there's not much to it. It would have been a great 30min independent debut but legitimately very few things happen in the film and to call it ""astounding"" or ""once in a generation film"" is a far cry from any truth. I do however appreciate the fresh attempt to a horror film, as so many in the genre feel similar and stale (hence the 3 stars for effort). I struggled to find anything else redeeming about this film. Pretty cool that it only cost them $15k to make but without any effects and only filming in one location with the majority of the film being still shots of obscure framing, it's not very difficult to hit that budget.In the end, make your own decisions but I would recommend saving yourself the time of trying to sit through this film.",2023-05-03
"POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERTSAll it is, is a 1 hour and 40 minute symbol for child abandonment and abuse, which is VERY obvious - and obvious is not something an ""artsy"" movie should be in my opinion. 90% of the movie you're literally staring at NOTHING. It lacked a real story and just seemed to be going off the symbolism which just wasn't enough for me. The cinematography was cool and interesting but becomes very boring after the first 15 minutes. I usually love eerie, gritty, slow types of movies. For instance, David Lynch's The Grandmother, or, Tsukamoto's Tetsuo: The Iron Man are slow, gritty, symbolic movies and they were captivating. Unfortunately, Skinamarink fell WAY too short on any kind of real story for me. By the end of it I just wondered what I wasted my time on.",2023-08-22

Currently seeing a 60 second closeup of shredded wheat in a bowl with no milk. Literally...that's a scene. But, it does transition to a single power outlet for 15 seconds after that.

Great, you know how to turn up sound to scare people. You know how to take shots of every corner of the house, but nothing about this movie made any sense. Subtitles are definitely required because you can't understand anything anyone is saying.When I checked to see how much more of this nonsense I had to watch to get to the end I still had 34 minutes left.

"As i watched this, i desperately wanted to see what was in the dark, and the movie doesn't ever give you that closure. But that's really not the point. The plot is there to give a linear timeline for things to happen, but honestly it is a compilation of someone very innocent going through something horrible and not being able to share it with anyone. I don't think it's the scariest movie experience you'll have, but it's the most unique in quite a while. Creative cinematography and incredible sound design combine to have your brain make fill in the blanks in the dark. If you need to read the plot to underrated what you're watching, it's one of the rare films where knowing the plot won't take away from the experience.",2023-02-03
My girlfriend and I started it and chose to just ride it out. SUBTITLES MANDATORY as half the things the subtitles say you don't even hear them say and the volume was way up. Horror was from horrible with this. Tries to be too artsy. The look and feel are trying to do something that could work but they never did anything with what they had to work with. The fact that they have character names in this movie are just for the characters to have IMDB pages. I kept cheering for it to get better as it's so absolutely unique that I had nothing to compare it to in a movie but more like an indie horror video game that they made into a movie. You will miss NOTHING passing on this.,2023-08-04
This movie is approximately 90 minutes too long. I'm all for an avante grade film but this heavily relied on distorted shots and bad sound mixing to replace an actual plot.What's really confusing is there were a few truly scary moments! Hence why I think it would have been a fantastic short film.It had about 17 endings and by that point in the movie I was checked out.My husband and I were really excited to see this advanced screening and we're generally confused on how to rate and react to it. Obviously after a discussion we landed on not great.I think this had definite potential but was too caught up in being artsy and different to pay attention to the important things like pacing and plot.,2023-01-13
"Simply put, I was truly scared and excited to finally get to watch this film. The preview was extremely scary and hinted at a truly horrific poltergeist-like tale. It had all the right elements, and had some heart dropping scenes, but overall never landed. The story never unfolded, just hinted at what was going on. The style of shooting and audio was outstanding, but it became too ""artsy-fartsy"" and unclear. It would've been nice to have more of a clear story and plot, especially the ending. I was expecting it to ramp up at the end and scare the life out of me. Instead, it left me scratching my head.",2023-02-04
"I decided to give this film a go when I saw that it had terrified a lot of my friends. I watched it in the dark, all alone, and prepared myself for an experience, and what an experience it was.This is not a film that will blow you away with plot or flashy visuals, but instead takes your mind on a wild ride of paranoia and childhood fear. Oftentimes, the best movie monsters are those we cannot see, because we fill in the blank with our own imaginations at what scares us most. This is a atmospheric litmus test on what frightens the viewer. Because of this, our experiences will be polarizing. And that's one of the reasons why horror is so subjective.I watch a ton of horror. It is my bread and butter. And 'Skinamarink' had me sleeping with the lights on. I do think that it could be a little shorter, which is why it's one star shy of a perfect ten.",2022-11-29
"I know a lot of people hate this film...but I can't say I hated it at all I watched it in a dark room, alone, on my phone with headphones in. And I went into this movie blind as I could. I didn't watch a single commercial. I didn't go online and look for spoilers. I barely even looked at promotional posters and material for it. What I can say after watching it, is that a movie theater would have definitely ruined the experience for me I think. Alone though, it brought me back to how it felt to be trapped in the house during a hurricane as a little kid. When the windows and doors are boarded up, when there's no exits and no escape, and there's a constant feeling that something you can't fully comprehend is there that could hurt you.Maybe I'm just used to watching the dark for hours from those times as a kid and so it made the movie less of a slog for me. Who knows. Either way, I gave it my full attention for the 1:40 min run time and I didn't come away feeling disappointed at all really. 🤷I think if people take the time to watch it alone, and listen really really intently, you'll get at least something out of it. This film definitely felt like putting together a picture in my head with the small pieces and snippets I was given. A theater of the mind type of deal, in a way. I'd honestly say it's the first time in a while I've felt challenged while putting together the puzzle of what's happening in a film. And yeah...I know that's not appealing to a lot of people, and not everyone's cup of tea, but when it comes to horror, I'd rather see a glimpse of the monster than the whole thing. My imagination is always the stronger creator of horror than anything someone can put on a screen these days anyways.(tldr: finally! A film that didn't over explain things to me like I'm an idiot and didn't treat me like I have the attention span of a toddler. I'm getting tired of films that feel like someone is holding my hand and pointing at the screen and going ""look there, isn't that shiny and cool?""This film has the decency to treat you like an adult with a brain, and you either put it together yourself or you don't. End of story. )",2023-02-03
"This is the worst movie I have ever watched. It attempted to be artistic and dramatic but instead failed miserably. This entire movie was actually 15 minutes long with an hour and 30 minutes of still shots of door frames with an occasional rustle or footstep. Of the whole 2 minutes of dialogue in the movie, you can understand all of 30 seconds. The rest of it is subtitles or unintelligible mumbling. Do not waste your time watching this, you will regret the time of your life that you have lost. The director must've been a 12 year old who didn't know how to edit and was stuck using every second they captured on their camcorder.",2023-08-28
"Disclaimer: I did not and could not finish the film, I gave up after 15-30 minutes but skimmed the rest. My experience can be summed up by the fact that the stream froze on a black screen and had to be reset but I didn't realize it at first because that's how the movie was.I was curious about the hype which was why I tried watching in the first place as I hadn't heard of it or seen a trailer, only word of mouth. After suffering I can only assume it is highly praised by viewers because of budget going towards fake reviews/PR (I mean, Bad Ben which was also made in some guy's home but only cost maybe 10% as much to make) and the almost adolescent mentality of rebellion, i.e. Being different from the mainstream is the equivalent of innovation/genius! If excessively grainy visuals and static, with only sometimes subtitled muffled talking, is the pinnacle of artistry then I must be an uncultured fool because I could not see the charm. A major pet peeve was that the camera was neither found footage style nor was it traditional movie style, rather just abruptly cut static shots completely off frame like if a play was recorded with a camera pointing at a curtain.Honest positive reviews fully acknowledge Skinamarink will be divisive and heavily dependent on personal experience, so don't put much stock into anyone hailing it as a 10/10 masterwork because nothing was unique, compelling, or even worth looking at. It's ultimately a shame, because the plot as explained by multiple reviewers is neat and would have been so interesting to see had there been any sort of escalation of events or emotional connection with the characters. None of this seems possible except for maybe with the greatest empaths, because there wasn't on-screen content to create any attachment. There are plenty of ceilings and corners of door frames if that's your primary interest.",2023-08-05
"This is not a movie for everyone, while it works for the group that it does, modern horror movies have made us use to being shown everything.This movie recaptures that feeling of being a kid and running up the stairs after turning off the light because there might be something there. It lets your imagination do all the work and while that will turn a lot of people away, it works for the type of people that like it.While the script is bare bones, dialogue minimum, and a lot of dark empty hallways, the movie delivers one of the most unique experiences and fills you with so much dread and anxiety that it's hard to say if there is anything like it.",2023-10-09
"I saw a lot of reviews calling this ""one of the best horror movies of all time, the next Exorcist and a masterpiece"". This is so much a masterpiece as a banana stuck to a wall.An experiment, and horrible at that, with no regard for the viewers time.I can advise you a better past time; open the tap, but not too much, until only a single drop fall, every few minutes. Stare at it. And keep staring for 1h and 40 minutes. If you did this instead of watching this movie, I just provided you with far better entertainment than this.The camera is so zoomed, that at some point I thought I was watching and ad to buy a house. The walls are white, with hints of purple (the colour palet through all the movie), since most pseudo intellectual b..s.t always tends to pick a colour palete; gray and black and white are the most used ones. This ""movie"" took the H. P. Lovecraft adaptation formula; purple. So much purple I cannot recognise white colours any more.Stay away. This movie is intended for rich, intellectual people, that drink out crystal glasses, their 130 year old whisky.I'm neither rich, or enjoy whisky, so, it's not for me.(I gave it a two star because it would be just mean a 1 star rating.)",2023-01-26
"Horror is my favourite genre. I have seen so many different kinds of horror films. I have watched movies that require patience that really pays off and I was looking forward to Skinamarink after seeing some favourable reviews. However, I feel like I just wasted my time watching it. While the atmosphere and premise are genuinely creepy, every vantage, nearly every scene, felt incredibly drawn out. It became agonising at times. I started to wonder if that was the point? While in some cases the quiet pauses staring into a darkened hallway built tension at the beginning it wore itself out about 30 minutes in for me. I still watched to the end. This could have been a quarter or a fifth of the length it was. I think it would have made a really good short horror film but at this length it became torture to endure waiting for something to happen. I was very bored.",2023-01-15
"I watched this movie because I had heard buzz at how scary it was. So much for truth in advertising. I wanted to give up on it in the first 10 minutes but kept going with a misguided hope for it to get better, it didn't. There is nothing redeeming about this film. I wasn't sure if the grainy filming was some sort of artistic effect or just very low budget. There was no character development. The dialog was so shotty that it made it hard to follow what was going on. For the most part I didn't even know what I was supposed to be afraid of. In short don't waste the hour and 20 minutes with this film!",2023-02-07
"Skinamarink is literally the worst, most whyonearthdidyoumakethis movie I've ever seen. The 25 minutes that I watched literally killed my entire movie watching vibe. I'd rather watch Teletubbies on 0.5 speed with the bread fish song on repeat behind it than watch that again. I'd rather kick my baby toe on a door frame with a screw sticking out full force then pour vinegar on it. I'd rather take high school pre-calc again with no calculator taught by Roz from Monsters Inc. It's unimaginable screen static, barely any dialog, starring at freeze frames of walls, floors, and kids toys. The director put a camera in a spot then left to make coffee, came back to change the spot, then left again and repeated that for an hour and a half. I'd rather go to work than have to watch this again :(",2023-02-16
"The only difference between this movie and nothing is 1 hour 40 minutes of wasting time. This could have been a GREAT movie as the atmosphere is THERE, but since absolutely NOTHING happens in the movie, there is not much to talk about. I can't really understand the purpose of this movie, other than an experimental one, and it could have easily been a veeeery short little movie, with SOMETHING happening in it. Instead we have this one, streeeeeeched out which feels like eternity, just to have NOTHING happen, except for 1-2 jump-scares, but that's it. Wasted opportunity. You life won't change a bit if you skip this one.",2023-08-08
"An attempt at editing this film should have been priority number one. Content is bare. Attempts at atmosphere failed. The tedious grainy murkiness is too much to bare. A hundred ceiling shots uncalled for: this piece has no business being marketed as a horror movie, it's merely a glorified student film nobody will 'get'. Be careful not to step on any legos on your way out...if you can find your way out. I'm sure if the filmmaker had thought to reign himself in and think about how to give his work more substance, it could have been watchable but as it stands the darkness is not always a story tellers friend. I couldn't wait until it was over!",2023-02-04
"This didn't feel like a movie. It may sound cliché, but this felt more like an experience. While following the main characters I didn't feel like I was being entertained, I felt like I was watching something ""real."" I'll admit that Skinamarink is not fun to watch, and it's hard to get invested at first, but I don't think it needs to be. The loneliness and dread really instill this feeling of childhood desperation that I've only felt when watching this film. I find it hard to review Skinamarink because there's not much substance. Rather I'd describe it with feelings. The feeling of being in a dark room at night with nothing but white noise in your ears. The feeling of being alone in a house that's usually full of people. Vague memories of your childhood home. The blue light of a TV shining in a pitch-black room.I have a memory from my childhood of being in my mom's room, everything was pitch black except the small blue light on the TV's power button. I felt my way around the room crying for my mom because I was scared. It wasn't just the dark that scared me though, during this experience I felt like she was just lying in bed not responding at all. I shook the blankets of the bed thinking she was there but didn't get a response. Eventually I just cried myself to sleep on the couch next to the TV, and I don't remember anything before or after that point. Looking back at it, the part that confuses me the most was the fact that nobody heard me, and no matter how hard I tried I couldn't open the doors to get out. It's possible this could have just been a dream. I don't have any visuals to go with this memory other than the small blue light. And I feel as though Skinamarink encapsulates that feeling of a memory that doesn't rely on visuals perfectly.If you added more plot to Skinamrink, then you wouldn't get that sense of ""directionlessness"" that the movie's atmosphere heavily relies on. You would just have a boring movie. It's the fact that this doesn't follow a structure that it makes it what Skinamrink is. If you removed the slow parts, you wouldn't have Skinamarink; the experience of a child stuck in their house with no escape. You would have a random collection of scares. It may not be everyone's cup of tea- But what Skinamarink is, is two children stuck in their house with no parents. NOT a movie, and that's what makes it special.(Spoilers):
Now regarding the actual content in the film. The house they use is cool (even if it's just a house), the lighting is cool, the darkness is cool, the composition is cool etc. The scare at the beginning when the boy scares his sister on accident was a bit of a basic jumpscare but then it was immediately followed up by a cute interaction between siblings, that really makes you feel for these helpless children. The bedroom scene was very intense, and the silence feels like it was best executed here. Once the sister was gone, I really felt bad for the brother....The knife scene was, well, not the hardest part to watch, because you aren't watching anything. You're just experiencing it, and once you understand what's happening, it just hits you. For me personally, I felt the desperation that the kid had to see his parents again. That's what scared me the most. Is that I knew exactly what it felt like to be a kid and want your parents so badly when you're scared. The crying of the kid is also brutal. The phone call afterwards is also heart-breaking, just hearing him say he was 4... And then the kid hears something and when he turns back to the phone- It's replaced with a toy phone. It felt sick. This is the first time a horror movie made me cry. Whatever the force doing this was, it felt truly evil. And then the scare with the phone later is good too.The ending though. The way the face the blends into the film grain. The way they appear out of the darkness, it feels like the kid is laying on his back and sees this face leaning over him. It's incredibly disturbing, and much creepier to me than the high contrast white eyes and stretched out face I'm used to seeing in analog horror nowadays. And then it ends...This movie wasn't a movie. It wasn't a documentary. It wasn't just 100 minutes of nothing either... It was two kids stuck in a house, who desperately want their parents to comfort them. And that's terrifying.",2023-02-06
"The anticipation throughout this movie is incredible, nothing has ever felt so disturbingly horrifying. The idea of the story is extremely metaphorical and guides you through a particularly thrilling storyline. Nothing disappoints within the entire film and the tension refuses to settle until the 'the end' scene. The film was never lacking, neither did it have too much going on in each scene. The perspective shown throughout the entirety of the movie was beyond incredible and it enhanced the true nature of the film. Whilst the ending may not have been as clear as other parts of the film, once you understand the connotations behind it, this part of the movie makes more sense than any other. Overall, one of the best analogue horror movies I have ever seen.",2023-04-01
"Not for the children that think Hereditary or Midsommar is the scariest movie they've ever seen. Although some will say it's a bit artsy, it's already gained a bit of traction on TikTok. Once it's officially released, I guarantee A24 will have wished they picked this script up. Unsettling camerawork combined with the lack of on-scene characters and tasteful jump scares potentially makes this ""The Blair Witch Project"" of the 21st century. Anyone who disagrees undoubtedly thinks Insidious is peak horror. Even with a lack of blood, guts, and gore, it still proves to be a very effective psychological horror movie. Don't believe me? Watch for yourself <3.",2022-12-16
"Kevin Smith once said in his standup that, since I am known for dialogues and how my movies focus mainly on dialogue driven scenes which helps keep the movie interesting, if I were ever to get a Marvel contract - I would simply let happen all the badass action off screen, hinted by sound cues that there's a fight going on, and then the characters come back in frame (implying dialogues is all he knows and whatever he cant do, will just happen off the camera)I solemnly believe nobody on this team knew what to do - EVERYthing happens off screen, and even when something happens, like god forbid a dialogue - We never know who is saying that. Nothing is explained and things merely just happen.A drug detox therapy is defined by putting yourself thru an immense amount of boredom where your brain resets its dopamine and serotonin responses appropriately; I believe if a person if tied down and subjected to skinamarink on lets say x.75 speed - a week of that and he can probably give up any drug or habit he's trying to kick.I rated this so high so maybe if one of the team's people is having a bad day and comes up looking for a good review to sort out their mood - and gets slammed w this.. God that would be a good thing.This movie literally offers NOTHING.NOTHING happens...I am ALL for slow burn horror, I like even the most vile pieces of crap movies but this is a nothing burger of nothingness.Empty frames with a sofa corner, or an edge of a mirror, or a doorframe in the corner, with occasionally somebody farting or a clock going off.An alarm going off is this movie's finest moment, by the way.... Yes.",2023-05-22
"My husband and I watched this movie together. He actually kept falling asleep, I kept waking him up. I rarely write reviews but this movie was that awful. We both agreed, it is, by far, the worst movie either of us have ever watched in our entire lives. It wasn't scary. People only whisper throughout the movie. Faces are only shown a very few times and it's very dark when they are shown. The whole movie is in the dark, characters keep turning their flashlights on and off. Do yourself and don't waste your time on this one. It took no real talent to make this movie. I could probably make it myself.",2023-10-24
"Spends way too much time threatening to scare you without ever living up to its errie expectation. It relies on you to scare yourself. If the threat of being scared isnt enough to get you then theres no reason to watch this. I laughed at the ending because it ends so abruptly without earning an ending. Nothing happens in this movie. It recieved so much unearned hype despite the film being: staring at dark doorways with a handful of jumpscares. They dont do anything with these doorways. Its so boring. It wouldve benefitted as a short film but instead, it drags forever. It doesnt use its dark setting to do anything unique. Its scariest bits are just loud. With such a unique premise I wouldve enjoyed more... or anything... from this movie. I loved the concept but nothing occurs. Its low budget definetly shows.",2023-01-27
"The ""scares"" in this feel like cheap jumpscares and it feels like this movie drags on forever. Literally a dog water film and I feel like I wasted years of my life watching this movie go on. It is some overhyped artsy movie that really did not need to be made. I know this is supposedly a glimpse of what it is like in the eyes of the child to be afraid or whatever but the execution is terrible.The cinematography was lame, the plot feels almost nonexistent and I literally yawned quite a few times during this. The usage of the old school cartoons feels like it was an attempt to make something creepy but man this was a flop and I feel bad for anyone that actually paid money to see this.",2023-07-18
"The tragedy of this is I really liked the summary I read on Wikipedia (which is a determining factor when I'm not sure if I want to see a movie). The summary was really good and I thought I was in for a childhood nightmare of a movie. Unfortunately, while the story was good, they were way too subtle in execution. The scene in the bedroom was actually terrifying, they used the subtlety really well there, but there were two significant moments that were actually better in the plot summary than in the actual movie. I can write off bad movies but the painful ones are the ones that had potential, and this one did. I encourage you to read the Wikipedia summary. It's a good read. In execution, though, there were some details mentioned in the summary that I actually wouldn't have understood happened from just watching the movie. Once again, read the plot summary. I don't know who writes them all, but Wikipedia gives excellent plot summaries for any book or movie you might not want to give all your time to.",2023-01-23
Skinamarink is a beautiful nightmare. The sound design and visuals are incredible.I wouldn't recommend it to most folks and understand why it's received many negative reviews. It's slow paced; especially the beginning. There's very little dialog. The white noise and film grain are generally persistent throughout the entire runtime.Yet the slow pace created chilling suspense. The dialog was dark. Dramatic changes to the noise floor left me feeling like I had leapt off a cliff. The film grain kept me fixated on the darkness. The dancing of the grain made everything feel more alive.Catch it in the theater if you can! The wall of ominous tension was palpable. The experience is going to stick with me for a long time. It's one of the most unique horror films I've ever seen.,2023-01-14
"There's parts of it I like, parts I wish I could change, and parts I would prefer to remove entirely. The entire movie feels like build up for a few lack-luster payoffs. This really seems like an ""experience"" sort of film, and mine wasn't great overall. Apparently ""A Ghost Story"" shares some similarities with its lengthy shots, so if you enjoyed that maybe give this a try. If you, like me, have no patience, just skip the movie and try out the shorter version on Youtube. If I had to give some advice for watching it, try to watch it alone in the dark (no, not even with your SO), the moments that really worked for me only did so because I was well and truly dragged in, and the reason I didn't enjoy a lot of it was because my patience ran out and I lost interest. The longer you can keep yourself immersed the better your experience will be.",2023-07-11
"I don't want to move or go to bed. Everything is scary now.This isn't so much a movie as something to experience. What you get out of it is up to you and how much of your own imagination you want to project onto it. It IS boring, for at least 20 minutes I really didn't think I'd be able to sit through it, but it kind of drags you in after a while and you find yourself staring at things willing something to happen, or trying to work out what you're looking at, If only to shatter the sense of dread building inside you.Others have mentioned it's reminiscent of 'House of Leaves' by Mark Z Danielweski (more specifically the film within the book, 'The Navidson record') and I'd agree with that. Whilst not a lot actually happens, there is something existentially disturbing about it and, like HoL, the horror comes from the emptiness and what YOU end up imagining is in it.I genuinely do not think I could recommend this to anyone really, It's too slow, empty and out there, but It's definitely done something to me and is going to stick with me for a long time.",2023-05-22
"If I could go back in time, I'd rather have watched this in the dark, alone, in my own creepy childhood home. Or in a different, strange home. Or on a projector outdoors with my back to a forest or something.(Except the constant light strobing is so nauseating on a TV in a lit room, I can't imagine what it would be like in the dark.)I'd still give it 5+ because I appreciate what it's doing. It reminds me of many nights spent with friends when we would creep each other out with spirit boards, or that unsettling fear of journeying the dark hallway to the toilet at 3am, or all the various night terrors and visual hallucinations.This story seems to be from the house's perspective. There wasn't very much tension, as the kids were left so empty. I felt like a ghost stuck in the floor, my worst nightmare of what the afterlife would be like. I suppose that has thoughtful merit, but I didn't exactly /enjoy/ it.I suspect how we choose to watch the film would matter a LOT. Just casually flipping it on blind with a plate of supper in hand was the wrong one!",2023-02-06
"This is one of those movies that I'm romanticizing in my head after the fact bc looking back I think it was really good but while I was watching it I was bored out of my mind. Which I guess it can be good and boring at the same time? It's projected to be the scariest movie of the year but idk. I saw this in theaters and ppl were literally falling asleep. Not even joking I heard snoring from multiple ppl. The concept is a child's nightmare and it does seem to capture that vibe. Also the fuzziness of the film is exactly what it's like trying to see in the dark, so that was well done. But far too much of the movie is spent staring at nothing, like literally just staring at the floor or ceiling and not seeing anything. Which is just boring and didn't really add suspense or intrigue. When stuff did actually happen tho it was really cool! Like the fakeout ""look under the bed"" was really tense, and the disappearing mom, or the creepy voice and face in the darkness. All of that was really good, it just took too long to get there. The ending was mildly unsatisfying tho bc it was not clear what was going on, and that's probably the point to leave it to viewer interpretation, but since it's inspired by a child's nightmare it makes me think that the whole movie was just a dream and not real, which is less interesting than there being a real monster in the house making the toilet disappear and sewing your sister's mouth shut. I think I would recommend this movie to other ppl just to hear their thoughts bc it is interesting. Idk if I would call it original tho bc it reminded me of indie horror games a lot with the visuals and sound design, and even the concept itself of being a kid trapped alone in a house.",2023-02-20
"Might be an unpopular opinion but I am willing to invest in a movie and it seems many are not.To be fair, with this movie you do need to invest in to enjoy but in an age of cliche and jump scares there is more than enough room for a slow, experimental movie that requires the watcher to bring their own inner sense of childhood dread.At a base level every kid has dreamed of waking up in a house they can't get out of with no parents. And no toilet apparently.I can liken it to the boy in the striped pyjamas insofar as it's entirely from a child's perspective and to get the full effect you really do need to try and image being a four year old.If you didn't grow up in a 70s and 80s environment with wooden wall panelling, a fisher price chatter phone and a box of Lego which didn't come with a pattern and instructions, maybe you'll not relate at all. I did and so I do.I do understand why this movie is divisive and polarising but I found it incredibly creepy and disturbing.",2023-04-02
"If I knew how to give this 0.5 stars I would. I am a big fan of analog horror but this is not it. Nothing of substance happens apart from the paint critics are huffing when giving this more than 3/10. To hammer home how much I do not recommend this movie, I have never given a movie 1/10 to friends or family. But now I am doing it online.It saddens me that people with actual filmographic talent may receive worse ratings than this movie, because at least in their movies something might happen. If I watched this movie again it would only be to feel numb inside.This is like 'the room' but if 'the room' was literally about a room and they just filmed some walls for 100 minutes.",2023-02-18
"This movie -- even though a lot of people don't like it -- is easily one of the best horror films that I've seen. The movie hits all the checkpoints for me, considering a perfect horror movie. The movie goes deep into the childhood fears that I once possessed. The fear that is most explored is the fear of the dark, and what lurks in it. I loved that part of the movie -- where you're looking at all parts of the frame to see what's there and what's happening. Considering that, that made the entire movie an immersive experience. The whole time I was searching the frame, trying to make out anything and everything that could be something in the shadows.I saw this in a theatre and it was a fine viewing experience but if you want to get immersed in this, watch this at night in a completely pitch-black room with headphones on. Then, it'll feel like the horror movie that it is. A horror movie that is basically like looking down the basement stairs at night and seeing a face at the bottom of the stairs. The entire movie brings a feeling of very unsetting nervousness and terror. Terror that can only be described as the feeling of waking up after a terrifying nightmare. Except that feeling is felt for an hour and 40 minutes.",2023-03-26
"Heard so much about this movie and thought it would be good. I was so wrong. People saying it would be a great short film have it bang on.Movie is darker than the most recent Batman.

"This is not a slow burn. This a boring waste of time. Could have made a good twenty minute short film. I'm not down for long, long still shots of blank walls, more still shots of doors, more still shorts of walls and floors for a 100 minute film. Not artsy, just dull and self-indulgent. The good, creepy parts made up less than five minutes of footage.I guess the sound editing is interesting and if you're into films with dark atmosphere, creepy, old-timey cartoon vibes and you want to keep away from the usual ""bright, noisy, all-singing, all-dancing modern horror, this might be for you.I just find the very, very long periods of, to be honest, nothing going on....too much and I DO usually like a slow burn.",2023-02-19
"After 30 minutes this movie begins to perfectly emulate the primal fear of waking up from a nightmare, in a pitch-black room, feeling like there's something in the corner, and if you make the slightest sound or move an inch it WILL scream the loudest it possibly can.The film's fatal flaw comes when you don't pay attention to it. You GOTTA be immersed, but then again if you don't prioritize immersion while watching horror movies maybe you shouldn't expect to like them that much anyways! The first 15 minutes or so serve purely to build up that immersion by providing an understanding of the house's normal routine so it can start to break down the established safe spaces. A lot of people think it's boring and clock out at that point, which is a shame because it means that nothing that happens later will work half as well as it does when you've already put yourself in the kids' mindset.",2023-01-19
"A different proposal when it comes to horror movies.How does a person's ""physical state"" alter their perception of life and the things/people around them?How does a person PERCEIVE the world in an (almost) unconscious state?""Skinamarink - Lullaby"" is a MASTERPIECE, but only for some... For example, it didn't reach me, even though I understood the message and didn't think badly of it.Never before has cinema been able to reproduce in images a ""coma"", a ""nightmare"" or a ""feverish state"".GREAT CINEMA !!! Although I don't like it... Hence my 5/10... It's in the middle...NOTE : Watch it carefully; it's definitely the most difficult movie to watch in the history of cinema, not just because of its monotony, but because of the attention and imagination it demands.",2023-10-31
"Not only is this movie absolutely terrible. But I actually hate everyone that gave this movie a rating that made me believe it was going to be decent. It's slow, it's cheaply made, and ultimately not scary. You develop no connection with characters, I felt it was difficult to even immerse myself within the movie. What could I even relate to? Being in a house and watching cartoons in the dark? 85% of the movie is just a cheap camera looking at various items and walls with old cartoons playing in the background. Maybe I've become accustomed to the new style of horror filled with jump scares that everyone complains about, but I would prefer that to whatever you want to call this. I was about ready to saw my own foot off just to see some action. I've seen plenty of terrible movies in my life time and I don't think I've ever considered trying to get a refund, until now.

"To be honest I didn't feel scared in this movie, actually the trailer scared me, the movie was a cycle of boredom that I couldn't take anymore, which is a little sad because I consume a lot of Analog Horrors, I'm familiar with this style of film with low quality and confusing, but Skinamarink just doesn't deliver anything, it's an interesting proposal, an interesting synopsis, an interesting concept, but the whole movie nothing happens and when it happens it's a jumpscare or a loud sound that doesn't scare, and that's very too bad because Analog Horrors from Youtube in 3 minutes even with rough effects they convey an atmosphere and an anguishing sensation that I never felt in Skinamarink, an example of this is the classic Mandela Catalog that with simple editions and distortions with low saturation and some 5 filters, made me more tense in a few moments of 1 minutes than in 1h and 40m of Skinamarink. I highlighted scary in the title even though I don't feel scared because this style of film Analog Horrors they only work as shorts, when I saw the trailer for Skinamarink last night I was really nervous with a sequence of nonsensical scenes and a voice saying ""In the house "", only with so little I was really scared, while the movie didn't even give me a little support, if it were a short film the concept would be better used, because Skinamarink gives the feeling that the guy had an idea for a book but the content is from a short story, it spoiled Skinamarink which became a boring movie.Even though I'm not a fan of Blair Witch, I love the concept of the movie and how even though nothing happens the whole movie, you still feel compelled to try to understand what's going on, that's the essence of Analog Horror, instigating the person watching to find logic with meaningless things. Skinamarink even instigates trying to solve ""The House"", but it doesn't have enough content for 1h40mSkinamarink clasp with note: 5Good concept, bad execution, looks like Prometheus.",2023-04-03
"Way too long. Like, WAY too long. It's an hour and 40 mins, should of been 20. If the movie was the last 20 minutes you would of thought it was good and want to see the director/writers first full length. If you want to sit down and watch it in it's entirety...take acid. That's the only way to enjoy this movie. Sober at 3pm on a Tuesday? This movie is hard to watch. It's like found footage of when I didn't know my 2 year old had my phone and was recording random stuff. Even the reviews that give 8's and 9's still don't like it. Why do people give crazy high reviews and then say eh it was ok. If you like this movie, it's like a 5. If you don't? 2or3.",2023-02-07
"Seems like a recent film graduate had his parents money and wanted to make a movie. Once you work in the Hollywood Film Industry, you meet people like this often. The ones who write, direct, edit...you know what I'm talking about. As a devoted horror fan, I knew this was the type of movie I'd either really love or really hate. I'm leaning towards hate...and hate is a strong word.I JUST finished it and have been thinking of what to say in my review because I knew I was going to leave one. I'll start by saying I am very confused to of what the purpose of this movie was. I can dissect aspects of it and probably figure it out. We learn that ""Kevin"" (also my name) has fallen down the steps because he was sleepwalking. Okay, great. So is this movie his perspective of being in a coma? Or is he dead? Really not sure! I can say I do appreciate this film being different and unique. That I can respect. On the flip side, what the actual blank did I and so many others just watch? I'm not hating on it because it's different. I'm hating on it because it made absolutely no sense.Almost every single scene is a static shot of a wall, the floor, a door, a tv, toys, closets, beds and even a toilet. That tells my brain that this isn't a movie completely. There were definitely some scenes where I did feel terror and anxiety. When they were able to capture those emotions, it worked. But the problem is the entire movie gives us nothing to really go off of. I'm a film lover who doesn't always love when movies spoon feed us everything. I often like to leave a movie having to use my brain to think of what I just watched. But not this one. This was too much of a subjective film, with little to no context. Also, what did the script look like? Had to be all interior shot descriptions with minimal dialogue.I'll touch base on the possible Demon in the house. That part was creepy but again, why? And what? Was Kevin dead and stuck in his house and is now in hell or limbo? Was his sister dead too? Why weren't the parents there? So many unanswered questions. I'm going to need to read an article or a Reddit thread to find answers because I can't figure it out.If you like experimental horror films that ummm give you virtually nothing, then go for it. I think most people will be bored of this movie. Oh and by the way it just ends and says ""the end"". So confusing!",2023-10-29
"In my opinion, this movie is meant to be submersive and experienced in a state of deprivation. It's not the kind of movie you're going to watch with a friend and comment over. It needs to be focused on and heard correctly with headphones to really get into. With that being said, I think there is a really fresh and unique movie here.It plays out like a nightmare during a half awake state akin to taking an afternoon nap or dozing off prematurely. The atmosphere is extremely anxious and as someone described in another review, a ""rorshach"" which completely plays with your mind and keeps you seeing things, some of which may or may not be there.It is completely unpredictable and meant to be enjoyed by yourself. I found it to be extremely unsettling and enjoyable, as not so much just a movie, but like stepping into the room and absorbing it all.",2023-08-17
"This is definitely a film for the elite horror fans who prefer the ""genius"" of a warhol film of a building shot continuously for hours or a blank canvas on a museum wall/gallery as ""concept art."" IMHO, any film not aimed at the Mensa crowd that requires us mere mortals to read a bunch about it to ""decode"" is a huge slog. In the theater I watched it, the people beside us walked out and at the end the people behind us asked, ""Were we supposed to like this?""I love Eraserhead, but to refrence the end of Spielberg's latest, with Lynch portraying John Ford, horizon line in the middle is boring, horizon line low or high is interesting. At least the concept of making it interesting isn't lost on some folks pushing the boundaries, unlike this film.",2023-02-12
"Don't waste your time. I understand what they were trying to do here but they failed in a very epic fashion.Poor filming. Combined with editing that... well. There was none. We don't need 30 second shots of a dimly lit hallway. We get it.The tension is. Meh. The acting is meh. It must be nice to make a movie with literally zero need for lighting or cinematography.If this was supposed to be something Kubrick or Blair Witch Project it really missed the mark.Just skip this film and go watch The Shining again. You'll be far more satisfied.Also, the ""grain"" that was so stupidly artificial is annoying.",2023-02-06
"This film is disturbing because it combines two different kinds of horror.First, fear-of-the-unknown: the terror of the thing on the dark side of the moon.Second, a more visceral kind of fear: the horror associated with a rabid animal on the prowl.And Skinamarink synthesizes these two, to create a perfect nightmare; suddenly the thing on the moon (and light years away) is now in your closet or under the bed. Suddenly it has all the power and voraciousness of a wild animal; but, it retains all the horrific possibilities of a childhood demon.Skinamarink is an excellent horror movie. It reminds me of the time when I was a child; staying up all night, with the lights on, because I was afraid of the dark.I highly recommend this one, as it is the one of the best-and most experimental-films I have seen in a while.My only warning to anyone wanting to watch Skinamarink is that if you do, you may lose a few nights of sleep...",2022-12-06
"This movie invokes a sort of dread hidden in all of us as it provokes childhood fears. You will ALWAYS be anticipating a jump scare. Someone described it as what sleep paralysis is like. It's a great film considering the budget was $15,000. My ONLY criticism is that it's too long. Someone can only be that tensed up with anticipation for so long. It could also have included more jump scares. Part of the adrenaline is waiting for the jump scare and the other part is experiencing the jump scare. But if the jump scare never happens...it's sort of a disappointment. *this movie needs to be watched in a very dark room*",2023-01-14
"This just goes to show you that even with the best concept out there, if you're an incompetent, trying-to-be-artsy film student; you can ruin it. The film is clearly trying way to hard, me and my partner really tried our best to watch this, it's a waste of time. The concept is REALLY GOOD but, whoever crowdfunded this just wasted their money. It's obvious the creators of this film wanted to do something different. Heads up; nobody wants to decipher every. Single. Scene, when watching a horror movie. Everyone loves a mystery, nobody loves unintelligible garbage that doesn't make an effort to explain itself to the viewer.",2023-02-12
"This is without a doubt, one of the most boring ""horror"" movies I have ever seen! Toys and feet, that is 90% of what you see. No scares to be had, no tension or feelings of dread, just intense boredom. Ridiculous attempts at silly jump scares, the grainy film quality Is headache inducing, and the run time is way too long. This ""film"" should have been cut down to 10 or 15 minutes, not an hour and forty minutes! Thankfully I watched it at home and did not have to pay for this. The high praise is mind boggling to me, I've seen better films shot on an iPhone. Do yourself a favor, give this movie a hard pass!",2023-02-04
This movie was soooo boring it really had no meaning like for it to be 1 hr and 40 mins this should have been 5 mins. I do not recommend this movie honestly I don't. I see why this is rated NR because there was nothing to rate. There is nothing to spoil with this movie. My 5 year old god nephew can create a better film than this. It doesn't even have credits at the end because there is nothing to give credits to. I was 15 min into the movie and was ready to go. Honestly this shouldn't be on the big screen it should YouTube for a 10 min video. If you watch the trailer you pretty much watched the movie .,2023-01-14
"This experimental film worked a charm for surfacing my subconscious childhood trauma of being raised in front of the TV. It's a fever dream in a film. Given the right atmosphere, it boils back the memories of neglect and fear of the unknown from the first person perspective of yourself as a kid in front of insanity inducing cartoons. While there is plenty of room to discriminate for it's atypical theme and nature, if given the right relaxing environment and ability to go into a trance, it sticks with you for a long time. It would be tough to recommend it to anyone, but don't pass it up if this sounds interesting.",2023-09-28
"I only found out about this two nights ago (yes, advertising worked). Watched its trailer and was instantly intrigued. Really was lured by the lo-fi aesthetic and use of darkness. But as I'm seated in the cinema, damn, I started dozing off. I hate when that happens. But it couldn't be helped. There were times as I watched, where I squinted to see if there were things recessed in the darkness of the house - I liked that. When I attend the Sundance festival, they have a section called New Frontier, which is primarily experimental - and this definitely had that feel. Actually, I look forward to giving this another chance when it shows on Shudder later this year, I think it'll play better on a screen at home.",2023-01-14

I can't believe I haven't passed out yet.I'm waiting for the scare. The something scary to happen.I'm afraid it's going to be these 2 kids throughout the movie.Maybe the will build a pillow fort and eat a cold hot dog or a bowl of cereal.Maybe food will magical appear and they will have milk and grill cheese sandwiches.I just need something to happen besides kids talking and distorted background noise!",2023-10-12
"Brian Tallerico is NEVER wrong about film. Except this time. This time he was wrong.God, I wanted to like this movie so bad. Low-budget, high-hype, somewhat-experimental horror is so far up my alley it's disturbing. The problem is, there is so little to like here. Zero storyline, zero resolution (not even that lazy kind of resolution where you still have to join the dots), and next-to-zero everything else.The artistic, dark, and claustrophobic visuals are a treat in the early shots, and drag this offering up to a 2/10. The problem is that this film's penchant for showing us the corners of rooms, and beds from the viewpoint of a toddler, outstays its welcome within about 10 minutes... and then there's 90 more minutes of it. The single, decent psychologically horrific scene in the film (have a look under the bed son, would you?) had me thinking that the volume was about to turn up to 11, but it ended up being wasted, and the solitary minute this scene was on the screen was not enough to offset the other hundred-odd that frustrated and bored me.Look, if you want to see something a little fresh in the visuals department, treat yourself to 5-10 minutes of this film, and then go and do something else. There's an outside chance you may even like it and want to stick around.I didn't, but Brian Tallerico did, and he is never wrong about film.",2023-01-22
"You're a little kid and you wake up from a dream in the middle of the night. You try to fall back asleep, but for whatever reason you can't, so you just lie in bed looking around your room. Everything looks different at night; familiar objects seem to morph into unknown entities, and you swear you can even see things move. Then suddenly you get a crazy idea. ""What if there's someone--or something else--in the room?"" Now you really can't sleep because you expect a monster to slowly appear from the shadows.This is the overall vibe of ""Skinamarink."" Kyle Edward Ball's feature-film debut eschews typical horror movie tropes and storylines, and instead focuses more on creating a nightmarish atmosphere. It's what I like to call ""ambient horror;"" it's not about structure, but the total sensory experience. Which is why it's best to see this movie on your laptop with the lights out and your headphones on.Having said that, there are some parts where focusing more on atmospherics and less on plot hurts the film. The pacing is slow, some of the shots are repetitive (did we really need that many shots establishing that, yes, the toys somehow managed to get stuck on the wall?), and because the camera focuses more on corners of the room rather than the two children themselves, it's hard to know what's going on sometimes.But I still enjoyed it overall, despite the flaws. I'm interested to see what Ball has in store next.",2023-02-04
"Well, I kept on saying to myself that it's LIGHTS, Camera, maybe action? Firstly this movie made my brain hurt trying to decipher what's happening. I'm a Horror fan & this movie is not even close to being a Horror show. Couldn't tell if everything is upside down or down upside!! Sorry 😖 Sometimes the tv or music is too loud making it hard to hear some of the talking going on. I understand (I think! 🤔) that maybe it's for the viewers imagination to take them into the movie story?! Even the Blair Witch movie (which I did not like!) was better than this sad wanna be a movie😢 Maybe the sequel will be better!!",2023-08-19
"Ever see one of this scary prank videos on YouTube where you watching something then ahhhh jump scare. This is that for over an hour.You will only really be able to make out half of what you see during most of the film and there is no real plot. It is what if we sucked the dread out of a ghost film and replaced it with bemused scrutinizing of home in the dark.Otherwise they had some cool effects. Sound design would be novel if the whole analogue horror thing wasn't well established online. The film grain effect they used really make the darkness ambiguous, perhaps too ambiguous.If you are a horror fan, skip this.",2023-01-15
"Skinamarink is probably the scariest movie I've ever seen in my entire life. This movie likes to mess with and bend your mind in ways you couldn't imagine. It feels like something you see straight from an analog horror short. The scares are well done, the sound effects are incredible, and the atmosphere is always creepy/unsettling. The only big problem this film faces is pacing. Of course it's building up to the scares, especially near the end of the film, but it does take a little to long. Yes, the scares are indeed scary, but the film relies a little too much on the build-up, especially for the first 30 minutes. The film will eventually pick up though and the viewer will be in for a blast. So, overall, this film is terrifying and, even with some minor problems, a masterpiece of horror media.",2022-12-20
"I feel like I get what it's trying to do. I know it's not straightforward narrative since that requires plot and cause and effect. It's more of a vibe than a story. It's an endurance test (even positive reviews call it way too long). I remember reading that David Lynch tries to get into your head. I feel like this tries to do that but it also dares you to keep watching. It's got interesting things going on mixed with frustrating decisions. The best thing it has going for it is the ambiguity. I've read interesting reviews and interpretations, but not interesting enough to make me watch it again. I can respect conceptual art for being ambitious and trying to do something new, but that alone doesn't automatically make it good. Like many people say, it's a nightmare put on screen. More specifically, it's like sleep paralysis. You're stuck there, grasping for understanding while you have zero control. I can see why it gets both praise and criticism. I find myself in the middle since I appreciate the effort but don't feel deeply affected by it just the same. I feel like its potential was not completely met but I am curious about what's next for the filmmaker.",2023-02-16

"I first heard about this movie on a TikTok ad and it looked kind of silly, so I decided to watch it when it came out on Shudder. Oh my god, was I wrong about thinking that it was silly.This movie is one of the best movies I have seen in a while. With complex, confusing lore, it leaves you wanting more explanations and answers. And the movie doesn't give you too many, which is what makes it so good. It leaves you thinking and wondering about things for sure. Skinamarink brings a new way of filming horror movies. To me it's one of my all time favorite movies. The way some scenes are shot in the dark makes you think that something is there when something isn't. It's like when you wake up in the middle of the night and think that a chair in the corner is a person. Overall, this movie is amazing and definitely worth the watch. It is kind of slow, so if you don't like that then maybe don't watch it. But me personally, I think that this movie is one of the greatest experimental horror movies of all time.",2023-02-12

Ninety percent of the movie does not move. It is literally still shots of walls and the ceiling. I was most scared of my phone dying. It is the most boring movie ever. There is literally nothing to see. If you want to get the same effect just stare at your wall, it is the same. Most of the people at the theater were sleeping. If you have bought tickets just don't go or bring your phone and headphones, you will need them. Other reviews saying that it makes you feel dread that's because they wasted money on a awful movie.",2023-01-14
"I'm going to start by saying this movies biggest flaw was its length. It is too long I think that if the movie was 40 mins to an hour and 10 mins it would have been so much better. I personally love analog horror, this grainy kind of confusing horror where it builds lots of tension. This movie had some great moment and sadly more moments where I feel the tension was lost because of the time spent waiting. Again I think this would be solved if the movie was shorter. I think when taking this genre and making it as long as this movie is, you need to add more meat to the plot where as with a short film I feel like you can get away with more mystery and openness. To be honest if you don't know what analog horror is and your not one for symbolism I wouldn't watch this movie. But if you like those things, then I would definitely check it out.",2023-02-15
"I literally made an account just to say how bloody terrifying this movie was to me. Even the story is horrifying in it's own way.I went into this blind since all I did know was that it was found footage and oh, boy- This is the first thing that actually made me jump since the Mandela Catalogue. This was like if kid me's childhood nightmare came to life in movie form.This movie is everything I ever wanted in a horror movie, but no matter how much I loved it.. NEVER AGAIN- I have never been so on the edge while watching a movie before. Just waiting for it to happen when I don't even know what ""it"" actually is. Words don't even come close to explaining the feeling, but ""eerie"" is the best way I can put it into words.Truly terrifying movie 10/10.Bravo to the writer and everyone that worked on this project. The kids did an amazing job and the adults definitely helped them show a role like this perfectly.",2023-02-11
"I wish I could rate it a zero, it was an hour and forty minutes of watching ceilings and walls. There was barely any dialogue, when there was it was so quiet, definitely needed captions. If you were to watch the movie without reading the description you would have no idea what was going on. I dont know if this movie was supposed to be serious but it was a good laugh. Everything in the movie was so dark who knows what was even happening. The most interesting part was the cartoons they played. Absolutely nothing happened and it was 100% a waste of time. I went into this movie with hope, I am disappointed.",2023-05-15
"Let me start off by saying, this movie isn't for everyone. It's very experimental in terms of the way it's filmed, the dialogue, the plot etc. If you're looking for a horror film with a typical plot and jump scares, this isn't the movie for you. This movie is all about the eerie tone.The way everything is grainy and dark. It's like a dream (nightmare). The constant static sound and muffled dialogue adds to the eeriness and dream-like quality. It's just like trying to remember a childhood nightmare. You can't quite remember all the visuals, but you can definitely remember how it made you feel. This movie captured a childhood nightmare perfectly.",2023-02-13

It very much reeks of "" I'm a Tic-Tok king and imma do this"". And is there a foot fetish going on? I've seen more feet in this movie than a podiatrist convention! More weird angles.....if I hadn't read the synopsis, I would have no idea what's going on. (Not that I do know in any case). I'm actually getting sick to my stomach from all the dislocated, angular shots of ceilings, chairs and floors. And FEET! Should have called this Skinamir-feet.

"I'm a horror fan so not much scares me if it's happening on a screen. I don't believe in paranormal phenomenon so even the Conjuring series seems more funny to me most of the time. But this movie, with the unusual camera angles and long shots of what may seem like nothing, but is there something, or nothing, there?It did creep me out and make me jump. Where normally jump scares are cheap and unearned this one got me like never before.There is barely any screen time for the actors, just their voices as they are almost always off screen. This isn't a movie for everyone because of how it's filmed. But if you want scary this movie can do it.The plot is simple and easy to follow up to the end. The actors do their job well. The scares are great, especially a bedroom scene about halfway through.I'm glad to have seen this in theaters in it's limited showing. It's one I won't stop thinking about for a long time.",2023-01-22
"This movie is one of the most terrifying and unique experiences I've had in cinema and I'm an avid horror fan. These other review make me incredibly frustrated. In order to watch this movie you must be able to legitimately put yourself into the perspective of another person's shoes. If you are legitimately unable to do that, then this movie is not for you. The empty shots are supposed to replicate the perspective of a child, and the graininess enhances the atmosphere of the movie as it makes its feel like you're legitimately there in the house looking for anything in the corners.This movie is one of the few that's best experienced at home, rather than in the theater. You feel that feeling you get as a child when you're home alone and any creak or bang could set you off. The film made me feel like I'm kid, afraid of the shape the coat rack took on when it was dark in the house. The second half of the movie had me under my blanket, clutching a pillow until the very end.Tbh I feel like everyone leaving a bad review must think Annabell or some stupid Nun movie is peak horror.",2023-02-19
"Skinamraink is very slow paced, and not very entertaining in a traditional sense. I can't really recommend anyone watching it, if you have a short attention span, or if you want the traditional horror experience. If you are not just a little bit invested after 15 minutes, then turn it off, it wont be for you.I've watched hundreds of horror movies, but never really felt this type of dread and anxiety from a movie before. This movie is just so experimental, and out of the box, that I kept watching. I just wanted to be genuinely scared, and it delivered in that regard, hence the high rating.My best advice is to allow yourself to be immersed, and allow yourself to have some patience with it. Don't go into it with negative prejudice, but rather with some level of impartiality..",2023-01-24
"I found myself wondering when things would go down and I was losing patience. But as someone who has experienced the astral world I drew some familiar feelings from it. Then I imagined it was what happened to children once they got sucked into the Poltergeist TV. We never see what those children experience. I imagine that must have been what it was like, they were hiding from the Demon. As the film progresses and it shows how long they have been there, I imagined that they had lost to the demon. That they forgot what they were and their energy now belonged to the demon. Their box gets smaller and in the next scene, the demon found its next victim.",2022-12-16
"I personally hated this movie. I appreciate what it was trying to do, and the experimental way it was delivered. I am sure that this is an absolute jam for some people. Just not me. Maybe when I was younger, and had more patience for this kind of experimental story-telling, but at my current age and lack of free time, I am primarily looking for movies with a narrative and scenes and all of that fun stuff you would expect to see in a movie.I almost paid for AMC+ only to watch this. I am glad I didn't and waited for it to come on to Hulu, which I already subscribe. I wanted to watch this for so long by going off of the synopsis. And, I mean, I guess the synopsis is true. I just feel that this shouldn't have been made into a full movie. A short, like it's original, is plenty enough.I would have rated it lower out of my personal taste, because I was bored out of my mind just watching graining video of walls, ceilings, and a couple toys, with some distorted spoken word sprinkled through. I hated every moment that I watched. But I do appreciate that it has value to some people as a new approach to film making, and I can appreciate that they attempted to do something new.If you like heavily experimental film making, that you can sit around with film friends and talk about and dissect (though I don't know what there is to dissect about walls and a toilet) and all that stuff, then maybe this would be your speed. If you are looking to watch a movie, then you should probably sit this one out.",2023-10-29
"-SPOILERS-While the movie is incredibly slow at some points, especially at the beginning, it descends into probably the most uncanny movie I have ever seen. But there are some requirements. You must be in a dark room, at night, with no closed captions on. This makes the movie 10 times better. On to the actual movie, the plot was somewhat lacking in explanation, but I understood some of it. To explain, and I won't go into too much detail to avoid too many spoilers, but a child falls down the stairs, and the next night, his parents disappear, leaving him with his older sister. Mind you, both children are very young. Things start disappearing, such as doors and windows, so there is no escape. Then things start happening. They hear voices. By the end of the movie you a dreading every last second, in a good way. I loved it for being something new, and actually pretty scary. I would not watch if you do not like long movies with very little actual dialogue.",2023-03-12
"This movie tries to make a whole lot out of very little. In fact the vast majority of the movie is stating at static images or darkness. Which I appreciate the fear of the unknown as a tool, you have to actually have some sort of catharsis to make up for it. The movie is 100 percent atmosphere with no drive. I appreciate what they were going for but frankly I was terribly bored. I can imagine that someone will love this avant-garde deconstruction of a horror movie, but I prefer something with a little more story and a little less staring at static for 30 minutes between each jump scare. Also the constant buzz from the sound design left me with a headache. Only see this if you know what you're getting into and like this sort of thing.",2023-01-27
"It's been 16 years since a movie trailer has chilled and intrigued me as much as the one for this film has.I guess you have to grow up a certain way for this movies vibe to really resonate with you.Yes, it could be summed up as an analog reimagining of Poltergeist. It kind of hits you over the head with it whenever that Fisher Price toy telephone makes an appearance.Also unsettling (and not unlike the film Poltergeist), the assistant director apparently died during the filming of this at the age of 30.For a maximum immersive experience, I highly recommend watching with earbuds, under sheets or blankets, like I did.Also, why did the toilet have to disappear?",2023-02-18
"There's a really fantastic short film in here somewhere. The great thing about this movie is how abstract, and ambiguous it is. The film knows how to create an uneasy creepy atmosphere that allows viewers to project their own internal childhood fears into the film. The grainy aesthetic feels authentic and raw. There are a handful of moments throughout the movie that are very affective, and have real dread/tension which I really loved. Unfortunately the movie is its own worst enemy. It's 100 minutes, and a majority of the run time is dedicated to static shots of mostly dark or completely dark areas around a house. There are such long stretches of nothing that I began to wonder if it was an intentional joke from the director. A little over half way through the atmosphere, and tension was all but gone for me and I was just waiting for it to finish. There was a moment or two that grabbed my attention towards the end, but it was too late by that point. There's no justification for the runtime in my eyes. All in all, this movie has a really great concept, and is executed well up to a point. I'd say watch it if you can find a 40 minute cut of it online.",2023-02-05
"I enjoyed this movie. It was incredibly slow, so know that up front. At times during the movie it felt like watching stop motion, which added to the eeriness of it. I think the director did something bold in telling a story in a non traditional way. I suspect we'll see memes and spooky gifs from this for years to come. The lofi essence of the film was a fun touch. To the critiques. With no action, the movie could have had +20 minutes removed. There is a lot of repetition that seems to overstay it's welcome. There are long periods of silence, which can mait hard to stay engaged. Worth a watch for its uniqueness. I understand the lower reviews.",2023-02-02
Experimental horror at its finest.Skinamarink obsesses over thresholds of light in the dark. Of doorways and ceilings and the empty geometry that shadows bring to walls and corners and the immensity of hallways where only a void waits at the other end. It demands you look for something in that dark because something is there and waiting.The only shelter that is offered is the flickering light of a television. Of nite lights that can't be relied upon. And the scattering of toys to break up the emptiness of a room's floor into something yours. Push the couch to block an open entryway and hide under layers of blankets and pillows.The film demands the engagement of the part of your brain that knows its being watched. That feels like it has to look behind you when you're also certain there's something in the dark in front of you.When Skinamarink reveals what's waiting for us in the dark... it's a shot I'll never forget. And I'm worried about that.,2022-12-01
"Kyle Edward Ball choosing to make a full length feature of his stellar short film Heck makes some sense, but the length makes zero sense. People that know who K. E. B. Is know that he creates video of user submitted nightmares and he's great at it, it's a rabbit hole every horror fan should go down. The visuals of Skinamarink are an improvement of Heck, the atmosphere is an improvement but it seems like he sacrifices viewer experience to stick to his vision. I respect that, but a feature film in theaters has to make the viewer a priority, it's not rock n roll and rebellious to make us sit through extended scenes if nothing, we are paying for this, it sn't his free youtube channel. I hope he learns this because Skinamarink is still good enough for me to watch his next movie.",2023-01-14
"If I'm being totally honest, I really loved the film. I understand it was boring to most and most definitely drawn out, but to me the horror elements were enough to keep me invest and the scary parts were absolutely terrifying. With the minimal score and shots they used I think it was most definitely a successful experimental film and I think a lot of film makers will be looking to this movie for inspiration and what can go right in the best way. The only reason why it's a 7/10 for me is because it does feel very empty. I think the movie may be misunderstood by most, but maybe I'm also being pretentious. Either way if you like experimental horror, definitely give this movie a shot.",2023-05-06
"This is one of the most incohesive movies I've ever seen. The creator/writer must have thought his audience knew what he was thinking. So much unexplained content, you could have broken the film into 10 minute increments, randomly rearranged them and the movie would have made as much sense. The concept has potential, but you have to give the audience more to work with than this movie was able to. It was shot way too dark. What was the point of having windows, doors and toilets vanishing? Was the mother home? If so, who was the father talking to on the phone? We heard him leave in the car, but nothing of him returning. Did he actually return or was his presence after that real?",2023-08-17
"I'd do anything to get back the 90 minutes that I lost watching this ""masterpiece"".I hope this movie will get banned for the ""outstanding performance"" that was displayed on camera.This movies shows that litteraly anybody can pretend to be a director and try to milk money out of the most outrageously boring film ever made.I think that the entire budget was spend on that damn ""grain"" effect.I've lost all respect for anything that can be called ""horror"" in this genre.I can't even gather enough words to finish the damn review, it was that bad.Save yourself the time and don't even try to find out more about this movie.I feel betrayed.",2023-04-08
"Skinamarink tries to be disturbing and it really did, but it overstayed its welcome and would've made great for a 30 minute short-film as well.The overall story sounds pretty appropriate with a 30-40 something minute runtime, the story becomes pretty dull quickly and is too blindly focused on making the viewer uncomfortable but the movie chooses a poor way by making lots of fillers.The concept is overall massively great and is innovative, but the final product feels unfinished. But you can do something better with this concept.This is a pretty great movie that shoots itself in the head blindly, however, you can do something great with this kind of concept. You just need to optimize it.",2023-07-16
"This piece speaks in whispers and screeches to the disjointed obscurity of childhood memories and an eternal fear of being alone in the dark. With big, almost too-processed sounds, it provides a few jump scares, yes; it also inspires your instinct to listen closely for clues as to what danger you're in. It's shot from a child's perspective, and a child plays the central role, but does not at all detract from the true-to-life subtlety of the film. At times it almost crawls along, echoing the feeling of time passing slowly when you're a child waiting for something to happen. The use of public domain cartoons to shape a truly frightening narrative exploring our childhood battle between obedience and curiosity.It requires your full attention. If you don't get the chance to see it in the theater, I suggest putting headphones in and putting aside all multi-tasking to watch.",2023-02-02
"The movies pacing is off but that's because this movie is too abstract at times. I get playing into the fear of the unknown, and part of that is nice for this movies antagonist, but also never showing the main characters or decent shots of anything other that corners or the tops of doorways. I like that the movies begs the question ""can an audience care about the main character(s) if they are only barely seen"" as I did care for the main kids who were hunted by this evil entity. It just is something that requires a bit more thinking than needed, and it's mostly because you're having to focus extra hard on the dialogue because the movie is supposed to feel like a ""home movie"" but most home video audio isn't that bad. I get maybe the entity affected it but it's never implied, and again it could have been so much better deepening a flesh out of the kids as characters and making the entity more of a menace to make it scarier. To go back into the pacing, the movie will go to shots to force some sort of time movement but because there aren't any characters to develop. The movie implies a few days pass, but right in the middle instead of having showed us the characters moving along, it just tells you ""oh yeah instead of the few days you feel have past 574 have!"" This opens up a huge problem, in 574 days this entity barley messed with the kids, but when it did it was big. It felt like the antagonist was just lazing around, until it thought of something to do while not actively trying to do much of anything to make itself spooky or try and do something evil(I don't even know what the entity wanted as I guess it wanted to be evil just to be evil, but it didn't go that hard into doing that) I will say tho hearing the kids voices talk and be frightened did make me sad but only because it did make me remember my own past, and reminiscent of my own fears as a child but if I wanted to do that I could have paid for therapy instead of standard ticket price for this movie. I enjoyed it to some extent, but it feels incomplete.",2023-01-14
"Nothing happens in the whole movie. Not to mention that you can never tell what is going on. The whole movie is filmed with odd camera angles that show random things like: the roof, a wall, a child's stuffed animal, Legos, the TV, or sometimes it's just darkness, or sometimes you can't tell what your looking at. The only things you really get to see about the characters are their feet. The ""monster"" or whatever it is never shows itself, it just whispers. All the voices in the movie are near impossible to understand or hear. The constant grainyness of the film is just annoying. There are few moment where it actually tried to scare the viewers and they where poor attempts at that. The film relies solely on the person's complete focus, paranoia, imagination, and random loud sounds that are almost never explained. The only scary part to me, of the entire film, was the stupid phone towards the end of the movie: which has no real relevance to the story (the story that makes no sense in the first place). Also the phone reference I made will become clear if you watch it, but don't bother watching it through just to see that scene, because there are way scarier scenes in other movies. Overall I genuinely feel like a group of 10 year year olds could have made a better movie.",2023-06-26
"Don't waste your time. Nothing is going to happen. There's literally nothing happening for 1 jour and 40 minuter. Nothing creepy, nothing interesting, just nothing.If I shoot myself eating breakfast it would have been more scary and interesting. Having no actors shown whatsoever does not make it more interesting.Having cheap cameras, sounds and effects does not make for a good movie.Please, whoever recommended this must be sadists, getting pleasure out of making other people suffer through the most boring experience in their lives. I almos fell asleep every other minute.I've never hope for anything to end more in my life.",2023-08-08
"I feel like this movie could work as a book. Conceptually it's not bad. It's about 2 kids trapped in a house where reality bending things start happening.The execution is where it falls apart. First off, most the movie is shot between random cuts, often close ups or Dutch angles, with nothing going on in them. It even takes the movie about 8 minutes before things really start happening. The kids react to the horror in the way kids at that age would, which comes off incredibly silly. The sound effects that occur whenever anything happens are also silly.Basically anything good in this movie is lost amid the goofiness from other elements of the movie. If you can overlook how silly everything is and how boring the story is, due to little happening, you might find it a compelling experience. There is an element of good existential horror here. I won't pretend it doesn't have that. It's just the whole experience comes off silly. Plus it's hard to watch given how slow everything is.It's definitely unique. I haven't seen anything like this. I don't think it's a fault of the production. I just think the budget was so low that they had to make the most of what they had. I feel like with some more money and maybe downplaying the kid element of the story this could have been a lot more interesting.",2023-08-06
"This movie will leave you feeling like you got ripped off of time and money. Absolutely the worst film I've ever watched. I was planning on leaving the first 15-20min in and decided to try and see what anyone that rated this movie high was thinking. I can't believe I sat through this whole film without the slightest bit of interest. I don't know why anyone would rate this above a 1. The idea sounded ok. But the execution was straight terrible. I've been more scared as a kid closing the door to my dark basement than anything that this film tried to show. If there is any review to determine whether or not you will see this movie, just don't. You're not missing anything.",2023-01-14
"Ok folks , iv never felt the need to write a review till now. I work in the film industry and view alot of different types of films . I like to think that I have a somewhat open mind about cinema and try to find something enjoyable about just about everything I view. That all ended this evening. For the first time in viewing anything in my 40 ish years of being a fan on cinema. I put this on and was completely at a loss for words... what I just viewed was the the single most unviewable thing iv ever seen in my life. Do you like shots of doorways , corners of rooms and objects in a house? Well this film has so much of that you'll never need to see that again.. ever.. do you like audio so bad the filmmakers thought.. "" hey let's put subtitles on for half of this dialog. Because we don't think the audience will understand half of it"". This has that. There is a plot somewhere. But I stoped caring about 30 mins into it. Regardless of the content of a film the one thing it should never be is boring.. that's what this was... boring.",2023-08-13
"Do not go into this expecting a movie. This isn't full of exposition, fleshed-out characters, or elaborate horror scenes. This is a minimalist approach to a relatively simple story, but the execution results in an unsettling and anxiety-inducing experience like no other.* Watch this at night in the dark, preferably in your living room *This is not a perfect film, but I think it uses it's time very wisely. Once you get familiar with its aesthetic and editing style, and once things get unsettling, you're engrossed with these images and sounds, never knowing what's coming next or when the silence will be broken.The horror genre is in dire need for creativity and quality storytelling (A24 somewhat excluded), and Skinamarink is a wonderfully refreshing film experience that pushes boundaries and unapologetically places you in dread and keeps you there for extended periods of time.If you're a fan of analog horror, you're in for a treat, but you may be left wishing there was more lore and mystery to analyze. If you're new to analog, you may love this experimental and off-putting approach to creepy storytelling.Only one way to find out...",2023-03-15
"I thought this movie was great, super super horrifying, I was tense the entire time, but also, I can fully recommend this movie to anyone.It will be a hit for some people. It'll be a miss for others. I don't want to say the negative reviews ""didn't get it"" for fear of being more pretentious than I already am, but you absolutely have to ""buy"" into the movie to enjoy it.Ultimately you have to make up your own mind, it's a weird slow watch but if you wanna see something different absolutely give this a chance.Here's my tip. Watch the first 10 minutes. If you don't like it, you wont like the movie. If you do, you'll probably enjoy the movie.",2023-01-16
"I watched this with friends. We all couldn't wait for it to end. So boring. Yeah the cinematic photography was cool, but like the other reviews, twenty or thirty minutes would have sufficed.Grainy footage throughout. Acting, the little that there is, is rather cool. You'll get to see plenty of the walls, roof, carpet, Lego and feet. Not scary at all. I wanted to fast forward it a lot but we managed to get through it. At the end we all exclaimed the movie needs to be called shitamarink.A long drawn out movie that could have had more potential. It's a big no from me. Great some people enjoyed it though!",2023-08-07
This movie is definitely hit or miss for people. If you need a scary looming monster and constant dopamine rushes you're not gonna be scared of this movie at all and miss the point. The movie uses irrational thinking at its finest and doesn't feed you every single answer like most modern horror does. You'll never get a truly clear answer on the mysteries it presents. Some shots are quite long and if you're someone who falls easily during a movie you will sleep as they overstay their welcome. However when these long shots have something occurring or something occurred recently it gets your mind and hear racing trying to figure what just happen or what's going to happen.Definitely a great horror movie if you're not a dopamine junkie.,2023-02-19
"This movie will most definitely pull the pseudo artistic film snobs out of the woodwork. This movie promised nothing and it delivered 100% on its promise. There is nothing here, I assure you. Please for the love of God do not waste your time on this, it will leave you with a headache, anger and deep regret. The anticipation of something more is ever present through the entirety of the film. I would compare it to edging without completion but there isn't even enough there to get past being limp. How this has a 5 at the moment is beyond me. I cannot for the life of me think of a worse movie, and I've seen some stinkers. With all of this being said, go watch it. You may (but definitely won't) enjoy it.",2023-08-07
"I grew out of being afraid of the dark a long time ago. But watching this movie took me back to a place I had forgotten about. Right back to my childhood home, in the dark living room illuminated only by a CRT television playing black and white cartoons. The parents arent home yet, they should have been back a long time ago. Maybe dads just working late tonight?This movie dredged up deep feelings of uncertainty and vulnerability from my subconscious.About 75% of those movie consists of shots of the walls and doors of this house from a child's pov, making the viewer feel very small. As well as grainy shots of the dark, which evoke feelings of paranoia, making you swear you saw a face or a human form. The other 25% are close up shots of the CRT television or the children's toys gathered on the floor of the living room.The story/narrative of this movie is sort of difficult to discern, much of it is up to the viewers interpretation. But from what I gather there are two main possibilities.A) Seeing as this movie is inspired by a short film featuring a child who has died from cancer and is now in hell (Heck 2020) theres a strong possibility that it follows a similar plot line.Or B) This is a symbolic story about divorce from the pov of the children. Theres is a lot of imagery of toys and furniture stuck to the ceiling as if the children's world has been turned upside down. At one point a ghostly image of the mother is present and she says ""Daddy and I love you very much"" and that is typically how a conversation about divorce begins.This is the kind if movie that leaves a lot up to the viewer to decide. It's a slow movie, best watched in the dark, at night, while just on the brink of sleep. When you're finished with the movie walk around your house in the dark, and feel that long forgotten feeling of being truly afraid of the dark. Peer into dark rooms and be afraid of the coat hanging off the back of a chair.",2022-11-27
"This is a joke. This is not art. It's lazy filmmaking presented as ""experimental."" It's insulting to put this in front of people and ask them to pay for it with money or time.After 12 minutes of ultra grainy still shots of parts of doors, the floor, corners of a closet, with absolutely zero music, dialog, or audio I decided to skip ahead to see if the whole movie was this insufferable - it is.Calling the movie unconventional is an understatement and is too much of a compliment. There is no plot, no linear storytelling, and no connection with the characters. The film offers nothing to connect to. It is literally just random shots of nothing - pretty much still images.It's a bore. It's annoying. Its insulting to the viewer. And it's absolutely insane that the filmmaker has fooled people into thinking this is art. It's some phony bs.",2023-10-29

This I imagine is the movie a guy made on a bad acid trip baby sitting their kids. What plot? What story? What suspense? I literally just watched some kids spirited away magically with no context and forced to urinate in buckets because toilet vanished and then died???? The emergency line was contacted but not really? Charlie Chaplin's black and white silent films had more context then this movie.

"I want to preface my review by saying I normally hate movies like this. But when I was a child I had frequent nightmares. There are some sequences in this movie that are exact copies of things that have happened in nightmares I've had as a child. It petrified me. The director was looking for inspiration and he saw a common theme with nightmares most people have, I think you'll see what that is in this film. If you KNOW, YOU KNOW.To truly enjoy this you have to turn all the lights off, silence your phone, and focus on it for an hour and a half
You also have to be willing to accept that you won't have all the answers when you watch this movie.But how many nightmares have you fully understood?",2023-02-05

Just a film about a house with some doors but no people.... what was the people making this horrible film thinking....!!!!!!I made me a profile just to warn others about this wretched thing.The plot is almost non existent, extremely thin and boring....The director is trying to be original by just filming the walls, floors, doors, lights and tv from weird angles. 95% of the movie is just walls, doors and ceilings?!?? What!! Sometimes you see some kids ankles and feet and if you're lucky and fall asleep you don't have to wait an hour to hear ten lines of dialogue that's just thin af.",2023-08-04
"Way too many random scenes, movie was stretched for longer than necessary. There were a few great moments when it could have just ended, instead they chose a very disappointing ending.Otherwise, it's a great and horrifying experience when watching in the cinema, in complete darkness and when fully focused on the movie. It brings back childhood nightmares, disturbingly familiar. A lot of ""wtf"" moments. It's always deeply unsettling when I see young children in horror movies, I think it added to the fear factor.I still can't decide whether it bored me to death or whether I loved it but one thing for sure, I feel traumatised.

I dont normally write reviews for any films but I've seen bottom of the barrel syfy movies that were miles beyond this dumpster fire. If you want to be bored and just completely fed up with a film, by all means give this steaming pile a watch.

"This move sucked. My review will be as bland as this movie. Shots of ceiling. Shots of grainy wall. View of banister. Oh some light. Finally words from small child. More grainy shots. These film makers are not artsy. They are boring. Waste your time watching paint dry. Oh look more words, a door opened. More shots of the ceiling. Shots of the light fixtures. A few more words. It's unfair that I have to write more words in my review than this movie has. I've had more fun writing this than watching that piece of crap. Ended up fast forwarding and eventually grew tired of even that. Finally enough words.",2023-05-29
"I had to see what the fuss was about. A movie rumoured to be from the perspective of the house in which it takes place. Interesting. Got some dry roasted peanuts and settled in. The film quality looked like someone took an old digital camcorder and hit it with 8mm film grain in after effects. Pixelation and noise, hmm. Toilets disappearing, toys dragged all over the house. Weird noises, voices, and images that could be people, could be a pile of clothes. It made me think of how amazing it is that kids can destroy a room or series of rooms in seemingly no time at all. Perhaps that was the real point of the film? This why the kids piss in a bucket, the toilet disappeared on them when time was suspended for a couple hours... I might have to watch it again somehow, some day. See what I missed when the pacing was lulling me to sleep.",2023-01-21
"The presentation of this film was very interesting. It's filmed like a home movie on a video camera from the 1990s. The fuzzy and crappy camera quality adds to the suspense and fear of the unknown this movie relies on for its horror. It also benefits from really good sound design, reminiscent of the recording quality of home movies from the 90s. There also isn't a music score to this movie, which adds to the atmosphere it is trying to build. It works pretty well and the movie even has effective jump scares because the movie lulls you into a sense of security with its threadbare narrative. However, the threadbare narrative is what's the biggest problem for this movie. The plot is hard to follow and by the end of the film it feels like nothing happened. There are lots of parts in the movie where there are minutes of shots of the house interior without music, people or anything. You don't see anyone talk either. There's no characters and almost no narrative. That's why almost as soon as I walked out of the theater, I mostly forgot about this movie.",2023-01-21
"Went in the film blindly and honestly, I didn't really like it. It was kind of boring and not that interesting. But when I saw the theory solving what the film means, I was so into it. I would have never realized the film was really about a family tragedy from a 4-year old's tumor injury, and the actual meaning behind it is heartbreaking. The real demon of this film is Kevin's mind. He's in a coma, and can't get out. After almost two years, he can't find any way to get out of his mind. He can't even properly disclose his waste, all because the toilets are missing as well. Overall, I'd give this film a 100/10, boring but when I figured out what was going on, it was the best film I've ever seen. Great movie and genius idea.",2023-05-26
"Too much of everything of one idea. Darkness, silence, loooooooong shots of nothing. No build up, no character base...nothing. These people had a great idea...but it should have been a short or a music video. An hour an a half of this was ridiculous.Ultimately, what's the point? To prove that no one has any patience anymore? Could be true, but this was pushing it. That the next generations need substance? Because if that was to goal, the result it yes, we need more than staring at a corner of a room or a carpeted floor for the entirety of a movie. You should never ask ""is the movie on pause?""This is more a ""let's see all the app filters I bought for my camera!"" than a movie.I LOVE scary, weird, horror movies...I would play this movie to help put people to sleep.",2023-08-27
The style is artsy and all but my problem is there are multiple jumpscares like the director knows the film is boring people out. And they are just C H E A P A F and no different from other horror movies.Parts of the film made me feel like I'm watching Mandela Catalog Pt.10.I can take experimental films but at least they need to make some sort of sense and little did it make in this one. The dialogs are like how a dog would imagine humans communicate. And what's with them speaking in a indescribable language? Do you forget English in your nightmares too?There are parts that I would say creative though. Would love it if it's a youtube series. Definitely not for cinema.,2023-05-15
"1:40 is way to long to watch nothing happening. I can say that if you have someone you didn't like over and wanted to get rid of them I'd suggest you put this on. No plot, vague at best, the whole grainy picture was distracting and unclear because it wasn't defined as to what prospective it was from- if it was through the eyes of the kids, camera or whatever. Movie kids have to be the most bravest kids in the world. Two very young kids in a house in the dark are going to carry a flash light that has the worlds longest lasting batteries ever, and not cry or freak out.

"This is movie is a different type of horror: an immersive one that if you don't get in it, you probably would get bored, and hate it. Skinamarink is a very slow movie, it takes its time to flow and create tension. The way Skinamarink creates tension, is with mystery; the movie confuses you to help immersion, consequently creates tension and anxiety.I really get in the movie, follow the mystery and get along with the experience. As consequence, I get one of my most terrifying experiences in my life. I literally was shaking on the cinema, and almost had a heart attack (not really, but you get it). At around the half of the movie, I was afraid of the constant dark, even so the movie always takes shots of it. I was imagining things on the shadows (psychological horror in its expression).",2023-05-20
Don't watch if you get overstimulated easily. Dumb movie unless ur a geek. Sloppy and nonsense. Would not recommend this to a single person. Surprised they're making money from this dump of a movie. If making movies like this is ur creative outlet so be it but i think u should get a new hobby. Ridiculous and very weird people will make money from this. Don't go see this it's so dumb. The noises were ridiculous and so loud. Shocked people say through this whole thing. Went to the bathroom 3 times for 20 minutes to try to calm myself down from the anger. Spent 24 dollars on a useless experience that only left me with pure anger. I am very mad i spent money on a movie that has absolutely no meaning and nothing beneficial. Maybe you can interpret this in ur own way but it's so stupid unless ur a nerd and love movies.,2023-01-13
"The movie was stupid & a waste of time & money to go watch!!!! It's not scary & makes no sense at all. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone to go see. I feel like it should of been more scary if it was said to have been the most scariest movie of the year!!! It had no plot really at all & it was all over the place really!!! There's so many other movies out there more scary to watch, not one I recommend to go see. For others who want to go out for a night out, I wouldn't waste your time and money on this movie. Very disappointed on this movie and wouldn't go see it again or recommend it to anyone else to see either.",2023-01-25
"The trailer gave me high hopes for this. After 20 mins, I was annoyed but I figured I'd give it a chance. After all, it could just be one of those ""slow burn"" type of movies. I watch it till the end and it didn't get better. This movie was nothing but shots of the ceilings, light fixtures and floors. Any dialogue (which was very little) required subtitles because it was all inaudible. I'm guessing it's supposed to be an ""artsy"" style horror flick but it was not my cup of tea.I was expecting scary and didn't get an ounce of that. Just annoyed I can't get back that 1hr 40m.Not recommended. Highly disappointed.",2023-02-13
"Truly a new era of horror is coming in and it's for the better. The days of cheap jump scares are coming to a close. Watched this movie at home but wished I could've seen it in theaters. It really unease's you to the point where you question your life choices. Although it's not for everyone, it's certainly for me. To think that some people would completely discredit this movie is horrible though. Even if it was not for you, the movie is revolutionary with its style. So please, give it a watch it is one of the best horror movies ever in my opinion, but even if not that, a great one for this year.",2023-03-06
"Absolutely, this is a very slow burn. Everyone I have shown this movie to/recommended have agreed with that statement, and to be honest most of them did not end up liking this movie. However, if you can appreciate/relate to the atmosphere that this movie is trying to establish then this will be a fantastic watch. This movie is really trying to bring you back to a time in your life where your familiarity in your own home has been turned upside down. Because it successfully brought me back to that point in my life, it genuinely terrified me. I am not someone who gets scared from movies, in fact (before watching this movie) the last time I couldn't finish a movie because it was too scary was during early childhood. I subconsciously held a blanket just right under my eyes so that I could cover them if I needed to. Is it the best horror movie? No, alien is. Is it the scariest? Yes.",2023-07-17
"This is an unconventional, experimental horror film that plays more like a confining nightmare that you are watching. It's more on the artsy experience side than it is your traditional plot and story.I rate this film so highly because I feel I have had this particular nightmare before--I am trapped in a dark house that is lit by TVs in adjacent rooms. There are no doors or windows to the outside, only ongoing hallways, rooms, and something else following me from dark corners. The way this film is shot is very much reminiscent of dreams many people could relate to. It plays on your inability to hear properly, see people's faces, staring into darkness, and being completely and utterly isolated with your fears, which keep playing out again and again. This film really got me a few times. It is genuinely unsettling and horrific.A lot of reviews have stated that this would be better as a short film (which is fair)--but it is also that! Check out the YouTube channel Bitesized Nightmares by the director, Kyle Edward Ball, and watch Heck.",2023-02-11
"No spoilers...I watched this movie two times in the theater. The second time because I couldn't get it out of my thoughts, and I wanted to experience the creepy soundscape and visuals again on the big screen with surround sound. Both times I got the same chills on the same scenes. 6 different moments that I won't mention. If the trailer didn't do anything for you then just stay away. The movie is a slow burn with moments of creepiness, and looks and sounds like a film from the 1970's that wasn't preserved over the years. Well done and very effective. Watch late at night, in the dark, and alone.",2023-02-05
This movie is accomplished as a fresh new light to horror. But what did it accomplish? The complete and utter embodiment of childhood fear. Disorienting and loud in the midst of a dark and quiet setting. The grainy film style shots change the shapes of shadows in the viewers own mind. This film will make you afraid of the dark once again. The film doesn't have much plot by design and it works well in that demographic. It's a true reminder of fever dreams as a child. Senseless fear as your brain tries and take hold of what it knows to be true. It describes fear's mystery and disorientation as other worldly yet not expansive. In fact the opposite of expansive. Entrapment. With something else.,2023-01-14
"This movie was every nightmare I ever had as a kid growing up in the 90s. It felt like more of an experience than a film. The rooms felt familiar, the toys, the way the movie is shot from a child's perspective is perfect at capturing the feeling of being little and everything around you looks different. At times on in the film I knew exactly what was coming next or what would be said, as if it were ripped from my inner childhood memories. That being said, I can definitely see how this movie isn't for everyone, and I would definitely recommend being under the influence of something while watching.",2023-02-18
"Skinamarink is a film that is easily one of the kind. It also shows that you don't need millions of dollars of CGI or even a multi million dollar budget to make a good film. It's very refreshing to see as I personally feel like as a horror fan since being, a kid, someone breaking the mold. We live in a day and age were horror, movies or just demonic, possession or slasher films. I will admit it's difficult, and not for everyone there isn't much dialogue in the film, nor is there even a clear shot. But that's what makes this one of a kind and so great , you have no choice but to draw your own conclusion. From someone who does not scare easily at all this movie legitimately freaked me out. We've all been a kid once and we know what it's like to wake up from a nightmare and swearing up and down that you are seeing a silhouette of something in the hallway, your closet, or just any crevice of darkness that is in the house. I would easily say that this is an art film, which is why a lot of basic minds can't admire the genius and the terror of the film. This is one of those films you don't want to watch alone... but I am proud of what Shudder has done. This movie redefines the genre, and there was a statement from a review, who it was from I can't remember, from the trailer that says ""Movies like this come around once every generation"". That person couldn't be more right. Just don't turn this film on expecting to see some type of format that you've seen before. It's not the conjuring, it's not smile, and it's not another Amityville movie. Keep your mind open and prepare to feel uneasy has any good horror movie should do...",2023-03-20
"If you're a fan of straightforward Hollywood movies, it's definitely not for you, don't even bother yourself.But for those who loves the unusual, who in love with the works of David Lynch (Eraserhead, Inland Empire) and Robert Eggers (The Lighthouse) - this is a real treasure!I understand why so many people hate this movie: because this movie is as unique as possible. Ordinary people just can't compare this movie with something else; they are confused because of the novelty of this strange style, and it makes them angry. Most viewers are used to cliches and stereotypes, but this film is about anything but cliches and stereotypes. This piece of cinema completely breaks all ideas about what a movie should be.",2023-02-17
"I went into this movie knowing what I should have expected and it made it much more enjoyable than if I expected more from it. Don't go into it expecting a lot to happen, but go into it expecting an ""avant garde"" weirdness. Not too much happens in this movie but not in a bad way, I see why some people find it boring and I have no problem with that. But you should know from other reviews if this movie is for you or not.It sort of captures what it would be like if you had a cool idea for a short film, and got the budget to stretch it out. But if you like strange shots of hallways and couches with the occasional actual human being sometimes, then go ahead and watch this movie, if not, then maybe don't.",2023-07-09
"Upon building the suspense for what feels like an eternity the payoff doesn't feel like it's ever worth it. The movie winds up being more boring than it is scary. The finale of the movie provides an incredible amount of intrigue and suspense then it's over, which made me feel like 90% of the film was window dressing and interesting imagery. I like the idea of the movie but I think the way it conveys its story (if it truely has one) is frustrating and boring until the last 10 minutes, making it feel like you can cut 80 minutes out and have a good short film, which is what Kyle bells short film heck was, and it's better. Great film if you have trouble sleeping.",2023-10-29
"People just don't like it because it's not like the generic Hollywood garbage we're used to seeing. With media like this, all that formula is dropped because simply: it does not work with it.Majority of the scares rely on the scene and atmosphere alone, and not just jumpscares and people dying in brutal ways (like almost all of horror movies). It's supposed to keep you on edge; anticipating a scare only for it to flake; kinda like the movie toys with your anticipation. THAT is true horror; not knowing what will come next. The idea of limiting how much we see of the characters is a great way to actually get a perspective on how to see we would react and think if we were in that position. The camera work also fits with how the movie feels; like a nightmare. Grainy colors and janky POVs; everything is surreal but unsettling.I think after all the half-a** ghost/supernatural movies and terribly written slasher films, we need more films with this kind of style. It really shows that the creators actually tried to be creative. Experimental and abstract, but this is a pioneer for it's genre in terms of it's position in mainstream media. If more theatres picked these kinds of projects up, there would be hits every time.Analog horror is getting popular more and more each day, and with genuine trial and error, this genre will be perfected.I will say though, it is pretty long, and I agree it should've been shorter.",2023-02-16
"This movie is not for everyone. If your kind of horror is clearcut, tidy monster/ghost movies or in-your-face terror and violence, then you may not enjoy this one. The horror here is much more abstract. It's visceral, ambient, and for much of the movie, subtle.Admittedly, not much happens in this movie (at least, not much that we can make out in the dark, grainy, and obscurely-framed shots throughout). Some may find it slow or boring. But the horror here comes from the tension. The fear of the things we can't see. The isolation and distrust of the senses that comes with darkness.The build-up in this film is long. In fact, several of the extended shots go on longer than they should. The result is a brilliant short film with an unfortunate feature-length runtime.One special note here is that the audio and visuals were masterfully done. Some may find these aspects annoying because of the low fidelity. But as an audio engineer, I thought that these elements made the movie more authentic and immersive. The audio/visual choices were bold and appropriately grating at the perfect moments.Overall, I really enjoyed Skinamarink but can recognize that it isn't for everyone. There were some brilliant artistic choices and some fantastic horror moments, but it could have been much more effective as a short film.",2023-01-14
"Please don't waste your time watching this. Not a movie, no plot, no script, no acting. Just weird creepy sounds and shots of a 1990's lower middle class suburban house. Oh, there's a door frame! Oh, there's a ceiling! Fascinating.....said no one ever.I can't imagine the people who like this 'thing'. Not my kind of people. I was BORED. I just don't believe anyone who liked this. Nope. I don't buy into it and can't imagine a rewatch ever. Imagine you are getting cozy on Halloween night and want to cuddle up and watch a scary movie. You put THIS on??????? I don't think so. Never happening. Not much else to review because there was literally nothing happening.",2023-05-05
"It is a demanding movie to watch... but it's refreshing to see something new being tried.And once you realize what actually is happening, it's actually a very clever production.But... realizing what is happening takes some homework, and I don't think one will get it without any prior info.I watched the movie 1st, and then searched for the explanation after... and suggest doing the same!Try it.... see what you can surmise. And if you want, search for the meaning of it after.I won't expose every detail here, but as my title insists, the movie is actually a clever attempt to represent what a 4 yr old child experiences during a tragic, life altering coma (which durated 572 days).There is no escape. The parents divorce, Mom hangs herself, and little by little, his family ceases to visit his body in the hospital, where his access to a toilet has been replaced by ""buckets"" or other devices.During his coma, he has several surgeries through his eye, hence the events in the movie related to that, perhaps in a coma because of a brain tumor or hemorrhage.",2023-10-28
"If you are looking for another run-of-the-mill horror film, look elsewhere. Skinamarink gives very little moments of relief as you are treated to limited visuals, lights, and dialogue to guide you through a dark house. Nearly every frame has you white-knuckled waiting for something to appear from around a corner or out of a shadow. And there is no comfort found in conventional storytelling either. The film is comprised of many static or limited movement shots--most of which nearly never show you fully what is happening. This writer/director creates the horror where it is most effective, in your imagination. This film is best experienced with ALL of the lights in your house turned off and the volume on the TV turned UP. Oh, and never look away or close your eyes. It won't help.",2023-02-27
This movie will make you wish you had 2 hours of your life back. It was way too long. It had zero scares and whoever directed it must not have children to think they would just sit watching cartoons whispering to each other. Do yourself a favor and watch something else. If you do like looking at the top.of hallways and seeing random Legos piled up though then I think you may have a real treat on your hands. At one point of the movie i thought maybe this may turn around but no it never does it just gets worse. So in the end I give this movie 2 thumbs down. Whoever made it should be embarrassed and find another line of work.,2023-03-31
"Wow... that was horrible. One of the worst films I've ever seen and by far the slowest and most mind-numbingly boring. I consider myself a pretty patient guy, especially with movies. I usually enjoy a slow burn but this was just so incredibly dull. When I was about 30 minutes in I was already wishing it was over. But I sat through it because I thought that something would eventually happen. I honestly wish I hadn't. I could have spent that time watching any of the other hundreds of films I have on my to-watch list. An ambiguous mess; the ending does not justify having spent 1 hour and 40 minutes watching this. I would have had a blast watching paint dry compared to this. Just extremely long drawn out shots of the edges of things. You never quite see the children's faces nor do you ever really see anything fully. The edges of a couch, lego lying on the floor, the edge of the TV, the children's feet. I like arthouse films and I like indie films but this was just a confounding mess. Now I know how people who don't enjoy ambigious arthouse films with tons of symbolism feel. I genuinely don't understand how anyone could have enjoyed this or at the very least didn't find it mind-numbingly boring. I wished it were me instead that got an x-acto knife to the eye.",2023-04-19
"Nothing happens in this movie at all. There's no other way to describe it. Apparently a child falls down the stairs in the beginning and we know this because of a phone call that we hear where the dad explains what happened presumably to the mom but we don't see or hear much of this just like the rest of the movie. The movie is supposed to play on childhood fears yet the children don't seem to show any emotion at all which makes it hard to be scared when the characters aren't. Half way through the movie the girl basically disappears without any explanation until the very end and then the movie ends with no explanation what so ever. If you want to know where these kids really are, how they ended up there, where the parents are, what the thing talking to them is, or any answer at all then don't waste your time because they never say.",2023-10-02
"I loved the way it looked like it was filmed in the 70's, grainy and filled with dust and hair. However, it was too much like I was watching a college art project or something by Picasso or Salvador Dali. Weird angles and sound made it very tough to follow but I just had to keep watching. Like the Paranormal Activity movies, I stared and stared looking for something to happen, waiting for the Babadook to do a jump scare. Too much work to watch. With that said I will watch again to see what I missed and maybe it will make sense. I don't think it will though, even if there are those that say it does, you know the people that say they understand how a blank canvas painted blue is brilliant.",2023-02-05
"Spoiler alert - 2 involved a phone, 1 real one, 1 not so real, the 3rd something did happen, the movie ended, abruptly. Thank god.I'm still trying to figure out if this was just some kids afraid of the dark with too active imaginations. Or maybe murder victims who didn't real8ze.they'd bee murdered and are trapped.in the house and that moment for all eternity and dragged us into their eternity.I'm now staring at the title card for this ""whoops I didn't my cellphone was accidentally recording for 100 minutes in the dark"" movie on Prime which categorizes it as Suspense (sure the suspense nearly killed me), Horror (I'm horrified I sat through tge whole.thing), Exciting (yeah, if watching paint dry excites you), and Thoughtful ( does 100 minutes of thinking WTF? And I wish ""I had some taxes to do"" coun't as thoughtful?)At least it came with my subscription....",2023-10-12
"Look, I get that a lot of people don't have the patience, media literacy, or interest to fully step into the space which the movie is trying to create, but through that effort a much more engaging and enjoyable experience was made. Not everything is going to be explained, and that's part of where the true horror of this movie lies, in the stray corner, the crack in the door, in the space in between.I don't mind if you don't enjoy this movie, it wasn't made for mass appeal, but to disparage the artistic value and intricacies of this movie is just so shortsighted. I feel as though this is kind of issue with a lot of art nowadays, people really just do not care enough to really get into something and appreciate what it really is rather than just an obvious surface level idea.If you do care enough, this movie's true form will become apparent, as well as the horror and plot within. Truly, I think this film is one of the most well executed piece of horror media which has been released in a long time and you should really give it the chance and care that will enhance your experience.",2023-02-06
"Ok.. the first 15 mins of Skinamarink had me wondering if I wasted 5 bucks. This movie is extremely low on visual effects & dialogue. But it is 110% on ambience. This movie will remind you of everything that scared you as a child. You cant watch it tired. Turn the volume all the way up and pay close attention. You haven't likely seen anything like this. There
are long moments where you wonder what is happening then you are slapped up-side the head with terror. Mark my words!: This is the birth of a new genre in horror; like when Blair Witch came out and created the found footage craze. I want to see other movies that capitalize on this TOTAL ambience effect. As far as criticism, I'd say this style would be more shocking if mixed in with what movie viewers are more used to. That is to say, instead of total ambience/experimental from beginning to end, start of with what viewers expect THEN switch to this movie's style.",2023-03-01
"It's the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. If you have 1h45 of your life to waste, go for it! The grain is so bad that you come out with a headache, no story, no suspense. I can't imagine that such a film could have been made. You don't understand anything from beginning to end. We stay in front of it hoping to discover a final fall that might make up for the film's extreme nullity, but nothing: lousy, null, deplorable, lamentable, uninteresting, boring, in short, revolting! Too bad I can't put 0 stars on it, it deserves -1000!!!! It's scandalous to put the public through this ordeal! Move on and don't try this atrocious cinematographic experience!",2023-10-06
"A film like this is not for everyone and I can understand the critiques here. It definitely could've been a little shorter, but I was fully engrossed in the deep hole the director created through a (very) slow burn. It is completely different from any horror movie I've ever watched and may have been the most terrifying I've seen. The filming is very disturbing. I wanted to crawl out of my skin the entire time and there were moments where I could barely look at the screen I was so uncomfortable, but I couldn't stop watching. Despite the blowback, I think this movie was intelligently done and requires a very open mind and maybe a niche audience. I'm excited to see how the director's style further develops.",2023-07-07
"You know what's crazy? Well, a lot of things, but a minimum character count for a film review is definitely included. What if you just want to give something a thumbs up or down? Blah, blah, blah. Anyway, all of that important information being said, isn't this website fun? No way this flick Is getting reviews so drastically opposed. The high praise reviews are too similar. Of course a film this small has to do what it can to get its foot in the door. Get your friends working for ya & such. Is it art? Maybe. Is it cheap? Yes. Well done? Perhaps. Is it hacky? See for yourself. You can't always trust the opinions of others. Especially strangers on the internet. This review is being suppressed. Who care really. Good art, bad art, everything in between is at least worth a passing glance. Isn't it??",2022-12-26
"There was good parts and elements. But it stayed on random wall shots to long and became tedious. It had a lot of jump scares from loud noises and the person next to me at the theater has their hoodie for their face for most of the film. There may be some hidden meanings that most viewers won't get from the first watch. The whole movie was 90% angled at the ceiling, on the floor or at on old cartoons from 70 plus years ago. I wanted to enjoy it, but I spent good chunks of the film hoping it would end soon. If it was a hour long then maybe I would have enjoyed it more. Director has talent but hopefully create a film trying to be so far out of left field.",2023-01-26
"I love horror movies. When I was told Skinamarink is like analog horror from YouTube and mix Blair Witch Project, I was heck yay!I remember reviews from TikTok raving on this movie as the most scariest thing ever.....then I started the movie and was boring.Only those with phobia of the dark, loneliness and monster/demon might be terrified.Myself I have difficulties sleeping and this movie is a real snooze fest.If I need any background noise while sleeping I can use this I guess.However if you willing give experimental indie movie with old VHS filter and captions, with only scares just noise from the children, tv and demon monster thingy then might be your thing.",2023-02-11
"Be ready for a extremely slow burn, but this really encapsulates a long-forgotten childhood nightmare. It's more of an artistic experience and definitely one for any analog horror enjoyers to watch and appreciate. There isn't a huge focus on plot, but rather cryptic shots that stayed longer than needed on screen and I do believe this could have fit better into a shorter film rather than feature length. Before going into this movie, read the little description and have an understanding of what the general plot is so that you aren't going in completely blind, even if that's something you like to do. Hope to see more from this director as they learn what works well for them :)",2023-02-25
"Don't listen to the reviews of most of these people. If you are a real horror movie fan and have seen all genre types you will like this movie. It is very original and makes you feel very claustrophobic. It is very eerie and suspenseful. It is very different. Not much jumpscares. You need it to be quiet, dark with no talking while watching this film. There was a scene or 2 that was making my hands sweat and making me want to cover my eyes. Give it a try might not be your favorite but it is very creepy. I really cannot even think of a movie I can compare this to, only complaint I have really is not much backstory.",2023-10-01
"I'm gonna be real, this movie had me wanting to turn it off 20 minutes in. I'm glad I didn't, as I watched the rest of the film and I can genuinely say it had me feeling any emotion you could think of that doesn't contain any happiness. The interpretation of this movie could go two ways, either the boy is in a coma or a demon has transported him to a horrible place just for fun. For me, I interpreted it as Kevin being in a coma after he falls down the stairs in one of the opening scenes. Everything that happens to him after is just his brain messing with him. Particularly the knife in the eye part, the ""572 days"" part, and the ""demon"" stabbing him over and over near the end. He's getting invasive surgeries, and has been in a coma for 572 days. At the end a figure tells him to go to sleep. He dies. This story, while it is sad, drags on at times and would definitely seem boring if you arent scanning everything at all times. Just for the storytelling and the concept, this movie is excellent and one of a kind, and kept that creepy ambiance throughout that had me frightened for the entire duration once the boredom that the first 20 minutes caused faded. In my opinion, this is an incredible film.",2023-10-29
"The first half of the movie had me looking at the clock constantly. The whole movie is unbearably slow. BUT in the second half of the movie it did somehow catch my undivided attention and I'm glad I didn't turn it off before.I love stuff like analog horror and found footage so this was really my type of horror movie, hence the relatively high personal rating.I wouldn't recommend the movie to anyone though because I know most people will find it extremely boring.I know this has been said in every other review and I agree with them, this should be a lot shorter. Pacing makes this movie what it is but I'm pretty sure that in 45 minutes you could still pull it off.",2023-09-30
"A lot of reviews on here say that this would have been better as a short film, and I have to agree. I'll give credit where credit is due. I did enjoy the VHS style it was shot in and there were a couple unsettling scenes... but that's about it. Unfortunately, what really killed this movie was the run-time and lack of pacing/narrative. The majority of the movie is a bunch of random shots where the viewer doesn't see much as it's dark / hear much as the children are whispering. Then all of those scenes were complied together to make a movie for the viewer to interpret. In short, this movie is an hour and 40 minutes when it should have been a 30 minute short film.",2023-07-18
"As my title says, I startet open minded but ended up being angry and frustrated for the entire movie.It is one boring mess of one frame shots being shown for way too long.If you would cut this movie down you be able to make a YouTube short out of it.Every time I thought now it will begin it just went on being insanely annoying and boring.This has to be the worst movie ever created, I would be able to create something better with just my smartphone and one day time.When you are willing to sit through this torture be prepared and warned. It will be brutally boring.I don't understand how anyone who supported this movie can sleep well.",2023-10-28
"My analysis for the movie is that it is a metaphor for child abuse. My metaphors will be in the brackets. It starts with them asking where their dad is (maybe he's not around much). Then Kevin falls down the stairs (I think the dad pushed him down the stairs). The dad comes back home and calls someone and says Kevin is okay (maybe trying to convince family members he's a good dad). They talk about their mom but kaylee says ""I don't want to talk about mom"" (maybe their dad has full control over their mom and she can't do anything about the abuse, so she's dead to them essentially). Throughout the movie something keeps telling kaylee to come upstairs (it's the dad asking her to come upstairs to abuse her). At one point, kaylee is seen sitting on the edge of the bed and slowly disappears (this can be a metaphor for her childhood disappearing/innocence gone due to the abuse, therefore Kevin cannot relate to her anymore so she's ""gone""). Kevin then stabs himself in the eye (metaphor for the dad hitting him giving him a black eye). He calls the police while whispering (doesn't want the dad to hear). Towards the end the ""demon"" causes bloodshed (dad possibly murdering them). At the very end, a man's face appears and tells Kevin to go to sleep and then the movie ends (Kevin dies from his injuries). So I think the dad is the demon in the house and all the doors and windows disappear because they can't escape the abuse.",2023-03-02
"It's been nearly 40 years since Kramer vs. Kramer, which struck horror in the hearts of those of us who endured acrimonious divorce. Many films have sought to soften the blow, though a few traded off of our wee fears and made terror out of them (Let Me In, Possession, so many it's a trope). With Skinamarink, everything is shot from the perspective of a child- or a really avant-garde cinematographer who has a thing for everything actually being smothered in shadow and several post process filters. The children have to endure teasing of spectres who rearrange their psychogeography in ways that deny their ordinary-ness of place beyond the parental, already schismed. There is a dreamlike genius in the rearranging of the commonplace and working within such spatial limitations, which achieves great suspenseful effect. However, it all falls apart even in the nontraditional storytelling with the women bearing the cost of male sacrifice. Men are injured in this film, yet women are punished for it. It's literally the same old story we've always seen. Men bear the scars for female independence. And this is not okay.In the end, I was impressed by the spare storytelling and even struggling through the hard to discern at times stylistics. But what lasted was the overbearing sense of male entitlement to silence and monsterize women when they choose to declare their independence, and a man sees that the windows of his soul are edited out with the quickness of Hollywood magic.",2023-02-03
"What's the show playing briefly on tv in the preview? It's from I believe the 80s and the host is a man in a beard who wears a silver outfit and cape. I recognized the little girl and boy clip briefly. Please someone help me remember the name of that. It has songs like ""O N E spells one that spells one, I'm having fun cause I can count to one."" And there's a giant fuzzy white ball that has a face and is a puppet but also goes along with songs. And a train episode- with actually kinda creepy looking trains. And they are heading for a collision with another train, they whistle at each other with growing aggression n worry. LOST PART OF CHILDHOOD. Help pretty please.",2022-12-14
"Just fresh out of the cinema after seeing Five Nights at Freddy's, so here's my spoiler free review for it.Now, personally, I don't find the actual concept of FNAF all that scary so I personally wasn't ""scared"" watching this. The jumpscares were effective but did this movie ever really make me feel uneasy? No, not really. But again, that's personal preference and not a dig at the movie at all.The sound design, cinematography and the overall design of everything (from the animatronics to the actual restaurant) is incredible.Now, here in the UK the film is rated 15 (which means children cannot watch it. Even if they are accompanied by an adult). In the USA, I know it's PG-13. For Americans who are probably wondering ""Can I take my kid to see this?"". Well, that's down to you. The film isn't overloaded with gory imagery, but there are one or two moments where it is extremely brutal, so just keep that in mind.The ""twist"" at the end, and yes there's a twist, is... predictable, in all honesty. If you don't know anything about the lore, then yeah it might catch you off guard. But if you're even just slightly knowledgable about it, you probably wouldn't call it a twist.Out of the horror movies I have seen, I'd honestly say this is one of the more lighthearted ones. There's a lot of humour here, as well as moments that do kinda make you think ""Is this a horror film?"". It's not ""balls-to-the-wall"" scary and I honestly don't think it was trying to be, nor does it need to be. It's just a fun film with horror elements, to me.Overall, really enjoyed it and would recommend it if you're wanting something to watch for spooky season that is not too intense. It'd also be a great entry for anyone just getting into horror movies.",2023-10-25
"If you loved the FNAF games, go see this, at the base level it's fun to see this stuff come to life, especially when the costume design and set design are this good.If you're a harsh critic, you might HATE this film.Its biggest problems are character development overall storyline, and horror factor. (This would be better if R-Rated, however, that's not to say you can't make a great PG13 horror flick.)Acting wasn't too bad, Hutchinson and Lillard are as good as they can be with the writing they were given. Same with the kids in the movie.How to Make it Better?: I can see this being a MUCH better film if they were to treat it like a one-room horror adventure, much like the game. Keep Mike in the chair, terrified of leaving the office, trying to keep the monsters back. (Something like Devil, or Panic Room) - Throughout the film they could've given him flashbacks to connect dots, conversations over the phone, and during the day he makes rounds in the town to figure things out - Then they could make his reason for going back each night valuable, like he wants to solve the mystery of the animatronics, etc.Just fell flat, beautiful to look at, some fun scenes, but you won't recommend the film to anyone who hasn't played FNAF.",2023-10-27
"So, I know it must be extremely difficult to take a simple gaming concept like Five Nights at Freddy's and stretch that idea out into a full blown movie. I totally understand that artistic hardship, but...The script missed the mark folks.I honestly enjoyed the stunning look of everything, which I gather most people assume would be top notch given the studio that made the film, but wow... the basic story was so very weak. I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to horror movies, but this was moving into borderline ""cheese"", parody territory.The positives: I was living for the look of the creature costumes. So many kudos there. The acting is pretty decent for a studio movie, as it really should be. Matthew Lillard was the standout performance in my opinion. The music was pretty cool too.Everything considered, I honestly enjoyed myself, which is the point of any entertainment product after all. So I give it a six. But that side-story, and most of the dialogue really needed to bake in the oven a little longer before being served up.",2023-10-27
"People are overanalyzing this movie as though it's supposed to be a masterclass in acting and screenwriting. It's a ""horror"" movie for children and teens, so take it as it is. It's not trying to be more than that. Kinda like what the Mario movie was. It's a fun time with some funny, suspenseful and heartfelt moments. The acting is average and so is the script, but who cares? I've never played FNAF and know nothing about it, but this movie was a solid time. The blonde police officer was my least favourite part about the movie. She was quite bland with zero personality, and when she was stabbed, it was like, okay, whatever. But I'd watch this movie again.",2023-10-27
"Listen, this is no cinematographic masterpiece, but it's a good whimsical even sometimes satirical camp movie. I was not worried when different critic pages reviewed it with low scores, because it's not for them...it's for the fans.Do not take it too seriously, let it flow, enjoy the funny effects, have fun with it.Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lilliard's performances were absolutely amazing. They bring so many good memories and was great to see them perform together.Obviously the movie is setting up for a sequel and we will be seated when it's announced. I just hope there are more little silly jumpscares 🤣",2023-10-27
"I found the concept to be a bit cartoonish, so I was expecting it to be more fun. The story had a slow start, and the main character's easily startled, and his constant jumpiness gets old pretty quick. Surprisingly, there weren't many jump scares, and it felt like a slasher movie without the slashing. They shied away from showing the gruesome stuff, opting for screams, shadows, and implied horrors. It's a little bit slow paced, thought it was a slow burn buildup but it doesn't get to the highs. It feels like it drags slightly.While the premise was interesting, it seemed like they focused solely on the plot, neglecting the fun and scariness. The concept was fresh, but it lacked imagination in the end. The whole ""kidnapped little brother"" storyline felt like an excuse for allowing his sister to interact with the robots, even though it was illogical given how much he cared for her. Hard to believe he wanted to find his brother so much he's willing to 'sacrifice' his sister. This inconsistency was hard to overlook.The film wasn't particularly thrilling, but I I did like how the aunt got got, even though it wasn't shown explicitly. The introduction of the yellow rabbit was genuinely scary, how he walked out, but once he started talking he wasn't so frightening anymore..Anyway, it's a little generic, not as fun nor creepy as it could've been; not too much to get you interested in the characters even though they did have some depth. Ultimately, a pretty mediocre and forgettable film.",2023-10-31
"I will try to keep this short and concise but overall I think the movie holds up to most expectations. Many of the negative reviews here are concerned with the plot but completely ignore the other amazing aspects of this movie, so I will talk about each of them one by one.I don't think the plot is that convoluted but that just might be because I've been a fan of FNAF for 9 years and I'm used to unnecessarily confusing plots. After watching the movie I could look back and say, yeah I understood that, so in my opinion it's not too bad.Lore-wise I don't think this movie is meant to be groundbreaking or anything, and that's not what I was expecting. If you come into this movie looking for game lore I don't think you would enjoy it as much as you would if you were just in it for the experience.The acting in this movie is incredible and I also really like the costumes and they really sell the show.The atmosphere lives up the expectations being based off of the first game, it feels really authentic and I quite enjoyed finding Easter eggs and such in the background.The music and scares were all pretty well done and I enjoyed them :)At the end of the day this movie is meant to be for the fans and I think that may be the reason why it's so negatively reviewed by the critics. I think as a movie meant for the fans it does what it needed to do and finally gave us the movie adaptation of this game we've been waiting for.",2023-10-27
"More of a 6.5/10 imo , kind of a casual fan of the franchise but It's an enjoyable movie. Animatronics , and the set are easily the best part . Acting is solid . U just feel bad for Mike , after all he's been through and currently going through with his aunt , not being able to keep a job to support him and his sister . It's kinda hard not to feel bad for him after losing his parents and his brother getting kidnapped. Matthew Lillard prob had the best performance. He did do a really good job imo as William there at the end , but he's barely in it . Ending imo was that good , I just think it woulda been better and more interesting if they didn't turn or he ""still had control of them "" at the end cause of the sequels (which I think their doing) cause now they don't have a legitimate reason to be these killer ghost robots .Even tho I did like the missing kid storyline , I don't get how Abby or any of the ghost kids knew abt it Garrett. They wasn't supposed to have any memory of what happened , so how could they know abt him ? Also I didn't really like Vanessa's. It's not the good type of dislike u want in a movie , but the bad type . She's just not a good written character. She had so many times to tell Mike what happened, but didn't until the end (which is extremely risky and dumb to wait that long ) the actor did a solid job it's just the writing that screwed her. Some of the kills were fine, just they couldn't show much of it cause of the PG13 rating . Which I'm fine with, even tho they woulda definitely benefited from being rated R, I understand their a kids horror franchise and making it go rated R eliminates majority of their fanbase. I can definitely see it being scary to some kids too . This next part is not me critiquing, just a wishlist for the next movie that coulda been in this one. 1 is ofc the bite of 87 scene , and another I wish there was a scene like the first game where the security guard (or Mike ) is just checking the cameras, and constantly closing the doors whenever one of them gets close to it and he has to save the power too. It woulda been really cool to see in live action.",2023-10-27
"The Five Nights at Freddy's is interesting and while I haven't' followed up with the most recent lore and games, when I was in middle and high school, I really enjoyed playing the game especially the first three as I thought they were fun and had some fun scares. I always like the animatronics designs and I did like the character of Foxy and Freddy. I had known about this movie since the beginning of its development and after being in development hell for years with various directors and writers switching, it is finally out. I knew this movie wasn't going to be some art-house/grand movie and I wanted to watch this for the purposes of having some entertainment and popcorn fun. As a whole, there are some good moments but it's underwhelming.Throughout, the production, setting and the atmosphere is solid as it helps to add the tone of the environment. On the technical aspects, the technical, costumes and effects are great. Especially the animatronic character designs as the character models of Freddy, Chica, Bonnie and Foxy look great. Moments where the animatronics were at play and the characters having to be situated around them, especially the building the fort scene and the group destroying the pizzeria, were pretty good and fun to observe. With the designs from the Jim Henson's Creature Shop, it's impressive and I appreciate them not using CGI on the designs. Including some decent gore effects. Unfortunately, the positive aspects are overshadowed with extremely dull characters and messy plot. The narrative is kind of all over the place as it feels like the writers are trying to shoehorn many ideas together in one and it makes things messy. There are some concepts that I thought were interesting but they were rarely utilized.Honestly, the performances weren't really great. Matthew Lillard's performance was pretty good but the rest of the cast members weren't great, especially some of the child performances. Including the cameos as they felt like they were just there rather than have the cameos be creative. The direction from Emma Tammi was decent but there are certain direction moments that felt sloppy and uneven on certain moments. None of the characters were interesting as they felt uninvesting and too thin to care about while at the same time, they were given some pretty bad dialogue which made things a bit difficult to believe a single word from them. Most of the horror elements feels weak as it is filled with horror cliches and serious moments that sometimes feel unintentionally hilarious. There are some attempts of non-serious tone and humor used but it doesn't work and comes off as forced.The soundtrack was okay and some of the pacing was off which made certain moments pretty boring. I understand this movie is more for the younger audience which is perfect for them but as a whole, it's pretty disappointing since the animatronics are the best part but the movie could have been better. Overall, the fanbase will like this and while I do appreciate the technical aspects, it's not a good adaptation.",2023-10-26
"I'll tell it straight to the point since this is the first review of this movie on IMDB. I'm a big fan of the games - there's some fan service, some really weird scenes I did not expect, and it wasn't scary at all. Completely lacked any jumpscares which, bearing in mind the games are built on them was a bit of a disappointment. I liked the acting and the animatronics were absolutely incredible. Sets were great. Some nods to the silver eyes book and purple guy but no bite of '87. No Markiplier so don't get excited to see him, he's not in it.I'd give it a solid 8/10 since I never thought it'd even see light of day and the atmosphere was spot on.",2023-10-25
"I was pleasantly surprised by this film! It had some great acting and the storyline undertones were just exactly what I needed for a Pre-Halloween fun movie!I would recommend it to fans of the franchise as both of my kids loved it and cited that they were a bit worried if it would carry through to impress them, but in the end, we were all fully entertained!I've never been exposed to FNAF games myself, but have known for years that my kids loved them and for horror game enthusiasts it was a popular franchise. I am happy that the movie didn't disappoint them and caught my attention as well.It's definitely a fun, thrilling family-friendly horror film for gamer fans and movie fans alike!",2023-10-27
Five Night at Freddy's was a pretty big letdown. I went in with the expectation to have a pretty scary fun time. Instead what I got was a boring cliche riddled film. Right from the start you can tell this film was geared toward the younger audience. We really don't get much scenes with Freddy and his friends even though they are supposed to be the main attraction here. There is to much setup to the story which is not interesting at all and not enough kills/thrills. Maybe under a different Director or writer this could have turned out to be a more enjoyable experience. Five Night at Freddy's gets a 4 low stars out of 10 from me.,2023-10-30
"Jesus, anyone giving this a ten wants their head checked.Feels like a wasted opportunity to me, because visually speaking, it was a really strong flick. The way the virtual world was brought to life was brilliant: the costumes, set design, cinematography, etc., were top-notch.But what on earth was going on with the story? Something about a brother being kidnapped and a bunch of 'ghost children' ending up in the robots? I still don't fully get what the hell it was on about.With a better story this could have been a really good film. Also needed a stronger horror element, and more of a 'claustrophobic' feel.It's a shame they didn't go down the route of the game, having the protagonist shut in the security room, trying to keep away from the robots. One of the creepiest things about FNAF is the robots moving without being seen and turning up somewhere else on the security screens, but not once was that used.This film had all the bells and whistles, but it forgets the most important facet: a gripping narrative.",2023-10-30
"Just saw Five Nights at Freddy's. That.... was a hot mess. Let's talk about positives first. The Jim Henson Shop out did themselves bringing Freddy and friends to life. They did primarily practical effects and it shows, the animatronics being the best part of the film. Another positive is the music, which was outstanding!Unfortunately, that's where my positives stop. This film has two major problems. First, it's PG13. This movie would have benefitted greatly from an R rating, it was tamer than the games. Second, the film can't decide if it is for fans or newcomers. The actual FNAF storyline is largely secondary to the plot of the lead character trying to discover who kidnapped his brother as a child. It's annoying, because when it's not being FNAF, it's just boring. (Also maybe it's the direction given, but the leads were pretty bland). They try to do a mystery thing with the FNAF storyline that doesn't work if you know the games. Matthew Lillard was perfectly cast, but woefully underused (He's in maybe 15min of the movie). Overall, I have to give FNAF the movie a C-. If you want a good version of Five Nights in film, stick with Willy's Wonderland, it's much better.",2023-10-31
"The Fnaf movie was a rollercoaster of mixed feelings. Part of the film is fun and thrilling, but the otherside of the plot feels rushed and has nit picky issues many will see.As someone who played the games and knows the story, for the casual fans this may be quite a confusing and the horror element is missing due to the age cap. It did not give me the same thrills the games gave. The animatronics are well designed and planned out but the movie pacing and plot will really annoy a majority. Some of the characters feel almost lifeless. The game element was missing with cameras, lights and power.",2023-10-25
"I felt the movie only benefited as a mystery drama synopsis not as a blood thirsty horror as the original games were. I understand this was all based on Scott's decision and rightly so but it 110% would've been better as the games if the horror was there. Yeah we only got a few blood scenes and a few jump scares but I really wanted more man lol! I also wish that the animatronics were scary af like I thought it was weird that them, Vanessa, Mike and Abbie huddled on the floor together like im sorry wha????????? XDJosh hutcherson and Matthew Lilard were good as Mike and William Afton but I felt the storyline was just stiff and un scary. But hey if it's a thing there is a sequel going to be announced in the future , I will try to attempt on checking that out and hope that it would be better than this first one.",2023-11-01
"My Background (I think you should know my perspective). (Overall opinion at bottom) (This may be more bloggy than reviewy)I am not a movie critic, and I am not a huge fan of horror movies (of which I believe this movie is not). But I am a movie enjoyer and I am a FNaF fan, this is my point of view.For half my life (I turned 18 the 25th, so 9 years) this franchise has dominated my media consumption. When this movie was first announced in any capacity (A little after FNaF 3 dropped if I remember., 2015). I could not wait. I NEEDED it. Millions of other children like me were ecstatic at the idea of a live action adaptation of the game. If you were like me, you certainly had to have loved this movie (unless you didn't), for the fact it came out at all, that it caters to the community we built for years, and that it was ACTUALLY WATCHABLE. I say it GREAT.My Viewing Experience.I came into the theater terrified that I would walk out disappointed. Fortunately I was very wrong. Of the cameos and obvious pulls from the games, none of it felt very forced (except for the mid credits scene with Cory and Balloon Boy). MatPat's scene at SPARKY'S Diner felt natural, and if I'll be honest I actually didn't clock that it was him until after he said, ""That's just a theory..."". It's honestly a shame Markiplier couldn't make it, I'd have loved to see what they would have done with him.What I think.The story I found to be very enjoyable, with logic working the same way it does in the actual game lore (it doesn't; cops are useless, how is Mike not in custody or at least being questioned about what happened Vannesa? How are Mike or Abby NOT traumatized in any visble capacity? Etc) While to normal movie goers that may be confusing, and for some even outrught bad, to us fans that's just how it is. Is that an excuse to have strange logic? No. But I personally accept it.Ignoring nostalgia (could we even call it that if I'm actively still enjoying the franchise?), this film stands its ground, maybe not as a horror film as previously mentioned, but it certainly is a reasonably structured foundation for, what I can only hope to be, one of many great films.Why It Didn't Need To Be Scary.I understand that the horror game adaptation SHOULD be scary. But tell me honestly, did you really, ABSOLUTELY need to see some absurdly graphic deaths in this film to make it have an impact on you? The games themselves aren't all that scary, most of us diehard fans are adults at this point. A few jumpscares are just not enough to make us cry and run away anymore. Is the storyline in the film still mature, such as the game's lore? Yes. Is it conveyed to us in a similar fashion (Mostly indirectly, like the minigames)? Yes.Why Some Claims Are Baseless (In my opinion).Ultimately this is THE FNaF movie. It is made within reasonable expectation, and those who complain about lack of gore, supposed lack of faithfulness to the actual lore, and other honestly minor details (animatronic eye colors), are viewing this movie in the wrong way.Uncategorized Rambles I Want To Put Out There.Let me tell you, if they turned this into some kind of action-adventure type deal, that would've been pretty cool. Imagine the final ""fight"" (I will be referring to it as that) being a full on brawl between Afton (who ABSOLUTELY needed more screentime, I LOVED the final fight) and the gang. In my mind that sounds AWESOME.I actually started to tear up when I heard the FNaF Song start playing for the credits. With how ingrained that song is in my mind and how it has influenced my tastes in music (and humor if you ask my friends) it was honestly impossible not to feel something with how important it is to me.Overall...At the end of the day, the story is interesting, it's a nice separation between game and movie. The characters are all quite good (I really need to see more William). The acting is noticeably off in some places, especially with the child actors, and Abby talks really weird for a child. The cameos, references, and Easter eggs do not carry the film, which is a GOOD thing. To reiterate, this movie stands its ground as a film and does not disappoint.My mom's point of view (a horror fan): To a non-FNaF, horror fan, this film is very much for younger audiences (not children, but not adults), but not a bad film.A stance which makes sense to me.8/10, Holds the most value to me in my heart.He Always Comes Back.",2023-10-27
"I'll preface this review by saying I have not played any of the games and barely know the plot. I knew it was about animatronic robots who try to kill the security guard and you play as security but that's pretty much my knowledge. I do not know if the movie did the games justice.Having said that, this movie was boring af. The age rating really ruined it. It would have been a banging movie if there was more blood, gore, death, violence, etc. Most of the violence was too tame or implied, and the deaths happened off screen. It needed more ""80's slasher"" vibes.Lillard was awesome as always though.",2023-10-25
"There have now been three films in this oeuvre, all of which are remarkably similar: The Banana Splits Movie; Willy's Wonderland; and Five Nights At Freddy's.The latter two of which have incredibly similar plots.Of course, I know this particular film is supposed to be based off a popular video game (of the same name)...and not just a blatant ripoff of the previous films.Although, I've never played it myself...so don't know how true to it it is.One thing is for sure, however...this is by far the worst of the three.Mainly, because the storyline, here, is so poorly developed.Meaning that The Banana Splits Movie still reigns supreme, at the top of the list.Although, this does seem to pay- at least a little bit of- homage to both of the previous films.In regards to the former, how the little girl makes friends with the robots.And in regards to the latter, with the scene where they have the main character cleaning up the mess left by the goons (in true Nicholas Cage fashion).The main issue I have with this film, is that there is too much focus on the backstory- where I found myself wanting it to be more of a pure horror.With the whole angle about the robots ""being haunted by the ghosts of dead children"" seemingly thrown in out of nowhere...which just didn't jive for me.On top of that, the little girl is portrayed to be much too childish for her age.So much so, that it's almost cartoonish.While, the overall structure of the storyline just doesn't seem to gel.Every time I thought the horror was about to kick in...it just ended up being drawn out even further, to make room for additional aspects of the backstory.Which seemed to be largely unnecessary.As, it, plain and simply, could have- and would have- been better, if they focused on making it less of a drama, and more of a horror.Because, in reality...there is almost no horror in this at all!And when it does, eventually, kick in...it's incredibly anti-climactic.Which leaves you feeling like, ""I sat through all that...for this?!"".At the very least...it comes off as a massive missed oppourtunity.Because I really thought this was going to be cool.But, frankly...it's quite lame.So I can't help but be disappointed by the whole thing.Because this was a completely unrewarding experience.2 out of 10.",2023-10-28
"With Willys Wonderland. I played the games and this has nothing to do with the games it does have some call backs towards the beginning when Lilliard is talking to him over the phone and what not but the rest was pretty much changed the whole looking for his brother thing that is missing is taken up more the screen time then the actual Freddy's. Instead of them hunting down and murdering them soooo far they are just hanging out with them. They figured out the dead kids are possessing the animatronics. Now they are all building a fort together.. 1 hour 13 mins in and he is now back to watching the security screens. Nope he is falling asleep trying to dream about his missing brother some more.. yawn.. All the little kids in his dreams again who are possessing the animatronics, tell 'em you want to know about your brother you got to sacrifice Abby to the animatronics. More dreaming him just yelling while little kids run around him, they start to slice him up. He wakes up to the animatronics trying to put a mask on him. Hour 18 mins in and he finally gets chased by one of the animatronics. This movie is baaaaad I'm stop my review there cause I don't know if I can even finish it.",2023-10-29
"Wow. This movie was a rollercoaster. If you haven't played the games, I can understand why you may dislike or be confused about what was going on in the film. BUT! If your a long-time fan of the games (myself included) you'll love it. The cast is amazing. Josh Hutcherson as mike was a great casting choice and in my opinion, he basically is mike in real life.There's plenty of easter eggs for fans and got me looking everywhere for secrets!! While the movie isn't exactly like the games, it's faithful enough that you can recognise it as a fnaf film and not some generic horror.Long story short, if your not a fan of fnaf, this movie probably isn't going to be good to you. It can be confusing and odd and that's honestly understandable. Though to people willing to get into it or just fans in general, I can guaranteed that this film will meet your expectations and standards.",2023-10-25
"This movie adaptation of popular video game Five Nights at Freddy's has been a long time coming; in the meantime, we've had The Banana Splits Movie and Willy's Wonderland, both of which have illustrated that making a decent film about killer animatronics is no walk in the park.Similar to Willy's Wonderland, FNAF sees a newly recruited security guard (Josh Hutcherson) discovering that the mechanical attractions at a closed-down themed restaurant have a life of their own. And just like Willy's Wonderland, the film squanders any potential for a wild and gory white-knuckle ride, director Emma Tammi delivering a very tame experience that focuses more on security guard Mike's troubled past and his relationship with his young sister Abby (Piper Rubio) than it does on the horror of being stalked and killed by homicidal machines.Avid gamers might enjoy seeing the characters come to life on the big screen, but I imagine even the most forgiving of Freddy fans will be disappointed by the lack of atmosphere, thrills and OTT violence in this uninspired Blumhouse misfire.",2023-10-26
"Five Nights at Freddy's is an adaptation of a popular video game. It already served as an inspiration for the much better The Banana Splits Movie in 2019.What should be a gory comedy horror movie. Five Nights at Freddy's is a more serious movie about grief and loss masquerading as a horror film.Mike Schmidt (Josh Hutcherson) is a security guard with many issues. He cannot get over the fact that his brother was abducted when he was a kid and was never found. Mike is unable to hold a steady job, hooked on pills and has anger issues.Mike cares for his withdrawn younger sister Abby and faces a custody battle over her with his aunt Jane.His career advisor Steve Raglan (Matthew Lillard) gets him a job as a night guard at an abandoned family diner known as Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Mike reluctantly accepts as he needs the job to keep custody of his sister.Only when he dozes off at work, it sort of amplifies the events leading up to his brother's abduction in his dreams. He also meets Vanessa Shelly, a cop who seems to know more about the history of the park.Then there are the creepy animatronic mascots. They come alive and kill some delinquents sent by aunt Jane to damage the diner, so Mike would get fired. The mascots later take an interest with Abby as they seem to bond with her when Mike brought her to work one day.This is such an uneven film, I though it was two different kind of movies that got meshed together. The horror parts only comes alive much later. Even then it is tame in order to be a family friendly scary movie.The similar themed Willy's Wonderland was more fun with a silent Nicolas Cage causing mayhem.",2023-10-29
"Started off slow, but the pacing was more or less the usual for a horror film. Although it was more of a thriller than a horror in my opinion. Probably because the movie was rated a 15. It was not scary at all yet it made you feel creeped out. Vanessa being Williams daughter is a bit confusing to the games lore, as well as Mike not actually being Williams child also. It got a bit childish when all the animatronics team up with Abby to make a fort. I felt disappointed that the movie went towards that direction. I wanted a scare, but all in all the movie was not actually too bad. It was visually brilliant, with the animatronics looking spot on compared to the game, but the plot just needed quite a bit of work. The visuals were worked on more than the storyline, a big let down for someone as myself who has been waiting 10 years for the film and has been a long time fan of the franchise. I was sad to see that Markiplier is indeed NOT in the movie, but I hope to see him in the second. Although a couple of other youtubers did make appearances.",2023-10-25
"I might as well start off with some positives.For one, the casting is pretty good. Hutcherson as Mike was a good choice, Matthew Lillard as Afton (even though they do nothing with him) was a good choice.The animatronics, production design, and the cinematography look really good. And, for the most part, the movie is very competently made.But now it's time for the negatives;For a script that apparently went through multiple drafts, the story makes no sense, there are multiple plot point and subplots that go absolutely nowhere and get no explanation.The editing and pacing in this movie feels incredibly rushed. There were multiple scenes that barely lasted for any amount of time.The special effects are just abysmal. I understand that they (probably) had a small budget and time constraints, but these effects are just cheesy, fake and ridiculous. There was a shot of Foxy running down the hallway, and if you pause and look down at his legs, you can literally tell that he is not running, but gliding.And then the rest of the movie is just plagued with mindless and ineffective scares, exposition dumps, awkward acting, forced YouTuber cameos, and characters you could care less about.In conclusion, I'm just going to go play the original video games and pretend the franchise ended after FNaF 6.",2023-10-27
"This movie put me to almost to sleep. The main character was asleep for half of the movie reliving the same dream which is boring. The cop lady was saying the weird things. She said she can't help him but yet come and saved his ass without even struggling with the fact that the person he was gonna have to shoot is her dad.The main character said at once point that the cop was scared in the back room when they were there cause he saw it in her eyes but yet the actor didn't look scared at all.Feel like all of the plot points ended in a weird way.For example aunt wanting the girl for money. It ended by having animatics kill the aunt then try to take the girl.The plot overall was boring, weirdly done and not in a good way.",2023-11-01
"Wow this wasn't good in the slightest. First off it took 40 minutes before anything happened and the story was so forced and hard to care about. I didn't play the games because they never interested me so idk if this is supposed to be a part of the story but wow was it a terrible story. The plot was so poorly thought out and cringy with almost no horror aspects at all. I thought it was supposed to be a horror movie, which from what I understand is what the video games were, but it ended up being a mystery movie kind of. The acting is horrible and the screen writing didn't help them. The interactions between the characters are so unrealistic and their emotions are so random and extreme. One character is so unnecessarily secretive it's frustrating. I'm really sorry if you're a fan of this franchise and I know you probably really want to like this movie but be realistic about it. It was one of the worst movies I've ever watched. The only reason I didn't rate this 1 or 2 stars is because the animatronics look really good, for the VERY limited time you see them.",2023-10-30
"Do general audiences just not have brains anymore? The audience score for this film is either artificially inflated or people just don't demand absolutely anything from films they watch now.The literal second the blonde cop shows up, I looked at my partner and stated ""oh! The love interest is here!""Everything about this film is telegraphed a mile away. There is an attempt to build a sense of dread but the film shows its hand almost immediately. The video game this is based on does so much better of a job building a sense of dread.Once you see the the animatronics in full CGI glory it's over. All tension, all scariness. All the air goes out of the room and I'm like ""Ah, cartoons. So Scary!""It's also obvious immediately that the ghost kids want the little girl. That the thugs the woman hired are going to quickly die. Even the cop being the villain's daughter, the big reveal, was not in any way surprising or shocking.Mr Blum, this film could've been so much better with better writing. I'm available. Lol.",2023-11-01
"First and foremost, the movie could have been far better easily. It is not an extremely bad movie, but definitely it's not a horror one. I mean, if there is no blood, there is no crime right? So, here nobody dies, Lol.Second, the script is bland and the PG-13 does not help. Obviously with a -R or +18 advice, it could have been a masterpiece. Instead the movie is more oriented to scare Tik Tok generations.Last, the cast is just Ok. I didn't know anyone before the film and after it I'm going to forget all of them. A shame.So, overall a missed opportunity to create something great, fantastic and scary. Definitely , I can't recommend to horror fans, because if there's no blood, there's no crime. Happy Halloween.",2023-10-31
"Fans of the Five Nights at Freddy's video game series were eagerly awaiting the release of the film adaptation, but unfortunately, the results were less than stellar. The film's biggest problem is its focus on the relationship between the security guard and his long lost brother. This subplot takes up a significant amount of screen time, but it's ultimately underdeveloped and unsatisfying. The audience is never given a good enough reason to care about Garrett, and his relationship with his brother feels rushed and forced.As a result of this focus on the human drama, the film doesn't have enough time to develop the animatronics, which are the real stars of the show in the video games. Freddy, Chica, Bonnie, and Foxy are all iconic characters with a lot of potential, but they're relegated to supporting roles in the film. They're barely given any personality or backstory, and their motivations are never fully explained beyond the obvious spoiler (which I won't disclose).The film's pacing is also a major issue. The first half of the film is incredibly slow and boring, with little to no action or suspense. The second half picks up the pace a bit, but it's still too late to save the film. The scares are few and far between, and the ones that are there are mostly predictable and uninspired. Definitely a PG-13 film.Overall, the Five Nights at Freddy's film is a disappointing adaptation of the beloved video game series. It's a shame that the filmmakers didn't focus more on the animatronics and the horror elements, as those are the things that fans were most looking forward to seeing.I'll give it 4/10 as the set was good. The lead actor was also very good in his role, but had little to work with.",2023-11-01
"Five Nights at Freddy's is a new horror film arrangement and written in part by Emma Tammi, director of The Wind. The films are based on the horror game of the same name.Mike Schmidt (Josh Hutcherson) works as a night security guard at the local pizzeria Freddy Fazbear. He has to work here for five nights, but during these nights he discovers that something is wrong with the pizzeria's animatronic costumes. So he begins to learn about a dark secret.This game adaptation works better for people who are familiar with the horror game, because it contains nice references and other easter eggs that link back to the game. People who don't know the game will not really understand these things.For a game known for its jump scares, designed to frighten and further frighten players, the film strangely has almost none of these horror moments. This film sometimes seems more meaningful to younger viewers of just sixteen. For older viewers, the film is not scary and if they know nothing about the game, the film may be more unclear, or overcome separately.The location of the famous pizzeria from the game seems positive, especially for people who are familiar with it. Since most movie studios didn't use CGI for this movie, the animatronic costumes of the Fazbear crew have to be brought into the movie. Jim Henson's Orphan Shop was responsible for the Fazbear crew. They are performed by puppeteers and stunt artists. This will get her across.However, the story of the film can be a problem for viewers of the film. In addition to the story around the pizzeria, it also tells the story of the main character. In addition to a dark past, he also has a struggle to retain the rights to raise his youngest sister. These storylines do not always correspond well with each other, which means that the film can sometimes be a bit unclear and difficult to overcome.This inferior script sometimes makes it difficult for the actors to come across well. Josh Hutcherson sometimes remains a bit vague. He does come across well as an older brother who tries to take good care of his sister. His sister is played by Piper Rubio, who delivers some decent acting for a novice actress. The brother and sister actors have a well-known bond together. Matthew Lillard also plays a small role in the film, which he portrays appropriately. After his previous acting work in Scream and Scooby-Doo, it is also nice to see him again in this horror film.",2023-10-29
"I know nothing of the game so reviewing it as the 'horror' film it claims to be.It's no horror film. I've seen scarier adverts.While the film has great visuals, these visuals are limited to the animatronics and half a derelict pizza place.What acting there is, is good. Likewise the soundtrack.But where it all falls apart is the paper thin plot, that is told rather than shown.First third of the movie is merely an exemplar to explain the game. The rest an extremely linear story that fails to explain itself.At no point is there any horror. Not even an atmospheric build-up.While the animatronics are good that in itself does not make a good film.I'm told the idea comes from a very popular game. No doubt these fanbois will think me a heretic who 'does not get it'. But I'm a movie-goer, not a gamer and this very poor film was at the movies.Keep in mind I'm reviewing the film, not the game.",2023-10-29
"I'm one who read the books and played the gameSomeone decided they should combine the 2. Why? I have no idea. Perhaps they saw the Nick Cage movie and decided they needed to keep elements of the game in it.The book itself is really good, from the child killer to the possessions, to the main girl's backstory. But they removed it all to fit in a main character who is a security guard for 5 nights (like the game).They kept the elements of the book with the serial killer and instead of a female lead with a tragic loss of a brother, the security guard has that. It's interesting how they decided to play it.All in all it's not perfect, but it isn't bad. I think the picture drawing parts were weird...and the jump scares were cheap. I will say the ending of the book series is awful, so this is a nice compromise.",2023-10-27
"I usually like the cheap and cheerful Blumhouse movies but this one properly sucks. A really terrible story that is totally pointless and feels like it was made up in the fly, terrible dialogue, cheap special effects and worse of all its not at all scary, how this got a 15 certificate I'll never know!! I was happy to see Matthew Lillard get a big screen movie as it seems like ages since I've seen him In anything, after this I think it'll be a while before he's back on our screen, awful performance. This is the worst film I've seen in ages and the first one I actually considered walking out of. This film is soooo bad it should have been shown at thanksgiving. Do yourself a favour and avoid this turkey.",2023-11-01
"The entirety of my nearly sold-out crowd seemed to love this movie. There were five different moments of full applause and cheers from the crowd. You might agree if one or more of the following are true: (1) You've played the video game. (2) You enjoy very tame/light horror. (3) You've enjoyed this new trend of ""family horror"" like M3gan (4 stars).None of those are true for me. I am confident that horror fiends will find it severely underwhelming. This is the kind of movie you might show to a 12-year-old who wants to get into horror movies. Just like with M3gan, the crowd was very young and there were even children.It's severely limited by the cowardly PG-13 rating. But I've liked some PG-13 horror movies, like Insidious. This one just isn't even a tiny bit scary. It didn't make me jump. The ""scary"" scenes amount to about 8% of this movie. The rest is fairly slow and boring.To make it worse, this movie makes no sense. You have to completely turn your brain off and not question anything. Otherwise the complete lack of logic and aimlessness of the story becomes apparent.It also has some very questionable moments and little things that made it feel off. One small example, someone uses fingers so wipe the blood off a knife, a move commonly seen by Ghostface in the Scream movies. The problem is, there's zero blood on the knife.This reminds me of a recent streaming movie with a very similar premise called Willy's Wonderland starring the great Nick Cage. That one didn't hold back, but it was a much lower quality streaming movie than this theatrically released one. I ended up giving it the same score.I didn't hate this movie. It's pretty funny and whimsical. I just really wish it was better and went all out. And I couldn't help but feel befuddled as the rest of my crowd kept going crazy at certain parts. I was sadly jealous.(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 10/26/2023)",2023-10-27
"I'll start by saying I don't know much about this franchise. My review is from an outsiders prospective. The PG-13 rating really hurts FNAF here. I understand they were trying to appeal to a broader audience, but this film has no scare factor whatsoever. If it was a gorefest, it could at least add some horror elements to make up for everything else this movie does wrong. The kills are mostly offscreen/ ineffective. The plot is weak, and laughably bad in almost ever way. Especially when it comes to these protagonists desicions.The movie is a slog fest. The animatronics basically take a back seat in their own franchise, which is a shame because the look of the animatronics is the only good thing about this snooze fest.",2023-10-31
"Y'all. The critics are such idiots for the ratings they've given this absolute masterpiece of a movie. As a long-time fan with a very in-depth knowledge of the lore and the story, this movie did not disappoint, besides the fact that it had to end!! I loved it from beginning to finish, I loved the added lore and the depth of the characters, from Mike to Vanessa to even Max. The cinematography was incredible, the sets were GORGEOUS (especially the pizzaria), the score was wonderful, acting was great even with the kiddos, and man oh MAN those animatronics. Makes me shudder knowing that they're out there, somewhere . . .Also- the jumpscares, man. I went insane every time even when I could tell that they were coming. Terrifying but in an amazing way.LOVE LOVE LOVE, and any fan will too! (:",2023-10-27
"I was looking forward to this movie, because I was hoping they would have the good sense to make it a proper horror movie. Instead what we have is anything but. Let me explain, this movie was NOT a horror movie. This was a ""who done it?"" with a horror theme. Now, why does this matter? Because now you're piecing together what happened, while being in a movie that largely tries(and fails) to establish itself as a horror. The twists and turns are more like tiny corners that anyone can see around, and were largely predictable. But the worst thing BY FAR was the fact that someone at the studio actually had the gall to make this movie rated PG-13 instead of R thereby having to cut out ALL the gore. So what you get is a movie that has no horror scenes in it. And it would've been a great movie had they left the gore in and really leaned into it, but instead it's bad, really really bad.3/10 I give actors credit for being the only good part of this movie. The studio is responsible for this catastrophe, not the writers, not the actors, just the studio execs.",2023-10-30
"I can see why some people are disappointed at the movie, because this is VERY loosely based on the video game lore. Don't expect crucial parts of the lore to be any important in this movie, nor anything scary, this is more like if a casual non-fan were to make a FNAF based movie. However, the movie on itself isn't that interesting or cohesive. At some points it felt like a drama, then comedy, suspense, then an action horror but at an uneven pace. The new lore/story was an interesting take but it couldn't compensate for how messy and rushed the movie felt. I question why a studio like blumhouse kept the movie in production for a bunch of years, and being made ""top"" priority just for it to come up short stacked and lack lustered. There was big potential on how to handle this franchise as a movie series but I guess long time fans have to settle for less (corprate hollywood production). But hey, it's for the kids.",2023-11-01
"This film had been getting excitement buzz for a large portion of the year and I could never work out why. It looked like it was going to be terrible. I'm guessing fans of the game were creating the excitement. I went in with an open mind though hoping to be pleasantly surprised. I was not sadly. This was the worst film I have seen in 2023.First of all, the film is incredibly boring. There is almost no horror in it. There's one scene near the midway point that would be considered horror I suppose, but it was probably the most boring scene in the entire movie. I understand the film is PG-13 but come on, give us something to work with.Then you have the unbearable characters. As if the adults weren't bad enough, the film adds an unlikable child to the centre of the story. Who thought that was going to be a good idea?Then there's the animatronic ""villains"" of the movie. I have never seen less scary creatures in a movie before. You could put these in a Disney Pixar movie and toddlers wouldn't be afraid of them.The film is long for a horror movie, coming in at around 110 minutes, and it feels every bit of it. The pacing is non-existent. Long scene after long scene with nothing being added to the story. I couldn't tell you how many times I checked my watch.People who choose this film as their 2023 Halloween film are going to be annoyed and let down. It's safe, bland and could barely be called horror. A generous 3/10.",2023-10-27
"One of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I usually rate way better than movies deserve. I scare very easily and absolutely none of this was the slightest bit frightening.Weak scoring, mediocre acting, SOO many plot holes, and low-tension conflict.This has less tension than a rom-com to be completely honest. I would not be surprised to learn that the script was written by a bot. Every plot point was predictable and each piece of dialogue felt like it was copy and pasted from every other movie I've seen.This was pretty much just a well-funded fan fiction. I expected much more of an adaptation of a very fun and frightening video game.It might be fun for kids, but it's not exactly appropriate because there is violence, so I'm not sure what audience they were going for... it certainly wasn't me.",2023-10-30
"Not easy porting a lot of gaming moments from the games into this movie. But somehow it's fun with a good back story. The core of the games is still very well represented.The brother and sister storyline is solid The whole story how the robots are being controlled was a nice spin on things. And everyone did a solid job.No doubt Blumhouse badly want this to succeed I hope it does because it deserves a sequel to carry on the story. There's a lot they could do here.Overall this was some serious fun , pure popcorn wasn't heavy on gore so no doubt Blumhouse will do an unrated cut . Megan would play well with these new friends.",2023-10-25
"It felt like it was an action movie at times, if it wasn't for its ties with the games which were good the film would be very bad. The fan service made the film worthwhile. Storyline felt rushed and incomplete. The big ending one of the most impactful and significant events seemed brushed over and honestly not amazing, it felt rushed aswell as over simplified. Cameos and fan service was enjoyable but that's what they're there for. If it wasn't for them it wouldn't be enjoyable as characters motives are weak and change with little influence. The entire premise was weak with how we interacted with the animatronics.",2023-10-25
"This movie is absolutely boring to the core it makes nicholas cage movie willy's wonderland look like a complete master piece (which it isn't) this movie consists of bad acting, flash back dreams, and some fluffy robots..
But for first hour or so not much actually really happens, you will struggle to actually want to watch the entire movie after being so bored already.Why is it a 15 (uk) no one really knows, a little blood here little blood there is about it.This title and any other they make will go down to the pit with all the other badly done video games to movies.It seems lately anything blumhouse touch turns to sludge rather than gold..Fans of the game will think this is a great movie for the fact is they like the animatronic figures alone but are forgetting about what makes a good movie.",2023-10-29
"I was very disappointed by Five Nights At Freddy's. There is no horror at all in it. It actually reminds me of a bad part 2 of The Banana Splits comedy horror movie and that was bad. Freddy's is worse than that!. They could have made it so much better and should have. PG13 says it all really. They should have bumped it to 15 or 18 and actually showed the horror instead of cutting off any potential horror. I just do not see the point in having somebody get killed but not get killed but they are killed. What I mean is, person about to get killed then scene changes to something completely different and of course, they are dead but no death shown. Make it a 15 or 18 and have it like saw. Show it all. What a big let down. I would say watch Banana splits, it is bad but it is better than this rubbish.",2023-10-29
"While the Jim Henson Company did a great job with the animatronics, they are utterly wasted and contribute no scares to the film whatsoever. The plot, so to speak, is spread throughout the runtime and is predictable at every turn.If you were expecting the movie to imitate the tone and content of the games, you'll be largely disappointed beyond a few names and easter eggs.If you were expecting decent spooks, plotting, or performances, you'll be more disappointed still.Matthew Lillard chews the scenery in each of his (too few) scenes and is far and away the standout. An anthology of shorts - perhaps tied together through Lillard's character - would have allowed for better scares and more closely resembled the source material.",2023-10-26
"My wife and I recently watched Five Nights at Freddy's (2023) on Peacock this evening. The storyline centers around an older brother striving to provide for his younger sister, whom his aunt intends to adopt. He accepts a job at an abandoned establishment reminiscent of Chuck E. Cheese, only to discover that the animatronics within are far more alive than they initially seem.Directed by Emma Tammi (The Wind), the film features a cast that includes Josh Hutcherson (The Hunger Games), Matthew Lillard (Scream), Elizabeth Dean Lail (You), Piper Rubio (Unstable), and Mary Stuart Masterson (The Stepford Wives).This movie possesses a wealth of potential with a captivating concept, provocative settings, a strong cast, and intriguing subplots. It had all the elements necessary for a potential masterpiece but falls short of expectations. The kill scenes are disappointingly lackluster, starting from the opening credits, which could have set a thrilling tone but did not deliver. There's a distinct absence of gore, visual depictions of killings, blood splatter, or any such elements. The film's PG-13 rating is a clear limitation. It's a missed opportunity, as the atmosphere is well-crafted, and the cast delivers stellar 10/10 performances. Lillard is a perfect fit for his role, and Masterson makes for an excellent villain. Hutcherson's performance is compelling, portraying an authentic big brother dealing with inner turmoil. The ending reveal adds to the film's intrigue. However, the subpar kill scenes remain a glaring flaw.In conclusion, Five Nights at Freddy's had the potential for greatness had it pushed the envelope and embraced an R-rating for a more intense horror experience. Instead, it caters to a middle school audience. I would give it a 4/10 rating, but I still recommend watching it at least once.",2023-10-28
"My kids grew up on FNAF and seemed like a great into to horror. I never understood the back story this movie explains it well. As for horror or scares, the movie has minimal. Definitely needed more suspense, killings and jump scares. This movie lack em all. The PG13 rating hurt this movie severely. Need to step it up to R for the sequel. The characters had great potential to make something scary but didn't deliver. Every night got tougher but not this go round. The girl seeing ghosts was a bit confusing at first but played into the story which helped explain the other characters. The movie was good but could've been so much better with an R rating.",2023-10-30
"So the only three characters that are interested was Mike & Abby Schmidt, Vanessa Monroe (COP) and Aunt Jane. The horror was darker tone to it and it wished it went an Hard R Rated horror that way it would of made more sense.Coming out of watching the film last night, I have to say that this film does not meet the expectations that I had as a fan. It is worth saying that the film was not awful, but I had felt that it gave the impression that the script was rushed and very choppy to say the least. The film failed in the aspect that it was more focused on appealing to the general audience, however this is a huge weakness of this film, rather than sticking to the original material( which is difficult, especially it is a video game) the film feels like a huge jumbled mess of cameos. Unfortunately I was wrong. I knew that it would be very unlikely (and probably difficult) to follow directly to the lore. The movie had aspects from the lore but it just felt all jumbled together, especially the 'I always come back' scene, kind of cheesy and it felt forced. The movies storyline was rather random, bringing in two random characters which make no sense. The only good things about it was with the animatronics design and how the end with spring bonnie entering but just a heads up for those who have not watched it. DO NOT WATCH IF YOU ALREADY KNOW THE LORE, THE WHOKE AND LOWER YOUR EXPECTATIONS. It does not link to lore at all. The story was off track and had security breach and FNAF 1 together. Two different time periods, two ends of the spectrum literally. The acting was amazing imo, but that was about it. The ""Springlock"" scene was super hype at first but as it continued it was so demoralising. It was more like an PG horror back in the 70's towards early mid 80's. So, the entire theatre/streaming services like peacock was making jokes about it, laughing, and overall mocking the film because it was so childish. Most people had dressed up for the occasion but only ended up ruining it with the shouting of matpat showing and shouting over the iconic lines and just chucked them all in at random points. I respect the actors for they did amazing but the script did them not justice throughout the film and had led them to not having the praise they deserve. They went away the aspect of being able to see them and to only see how the tracing back to his dreams at those moments. The advertising and hype for the movie but shows that it had none of realism of the games have and not having all the iconic moments when they were necessary. The fact that springtrap under going the springlock with not much blood or gore and the fact that it had happened then just went over and gabbed the mask before saying 'i will always come back' and just carried on and getting dragged away. It gave no context on the pain that would have been shown. They could have stuck with the lore and not try to focus on a hidden message. It most certainly did not deliver the hype & expectations of the audience whatsoever, despite stating on news interviews that they have delivered what the fans would want, I beg to differ. There was barely any soundtrack or sounds linked to the games which might have made the experience better or might have been able to add more context for the fans to appreciate. The only noticeable sound or song which was in the film was living tombstone which only appeared right at the end. The movie had aspects from the lore but it just felt all jumbled together, especially the 'I always come back' scene, kind of cheesy and it felt forced.The movies storyline was rather random, bringing in two random characters which make no sense? Abby/Abbie (I don't know what way it's spelt) there was absolutely no point in her, making the film corny with the 'oh I see ghosts and they're my friends!!😆' trope and don't even get me started on the table scene. I get that it was just some fun and all, but it just didn't feel like FNAF. In the game lore Mike was William's son so even if that link was made it would've been better. Also random point but it would've been cooler with some gore, like an actual springlock scene or being stuffed inside a suit since those are big things in the games.Maybe I'm just being too critical but I guess I'm just mildly disappointed. I'm sure some people loved the film and fair for them! Everyone has their own opinions. I just feel like it could've been written a lot better rather than a film which was trying a little too hard to appeal to fans with the mushed up storyline, when it had so much potential. (Literally could've just watched a few game theory videos and followed that story and it would've been a lot better.) The movie did have some good things to it, like the few Easter eggs (sparky was cool!) and also the cameo appearances were cool, like the living tombstone song at the end! The Animatronics were very well made too! The actors did a good job as well. To be honest even if they did make a sequel, I'd still watch it. I'll always love FNAF and just hope that if there was another movie it'd be better.The end of the day, I hated when we get like off screen kills just a plan shadow, it does frustrates that intention, Willy's Wonderland was a better film because Nick Cage does not use dialogue in this film only screams and yells, The Banana Spilts Movie was similar because animatronics was designed differently and when the computer system was created an demonic animatronics then it did have on screen kills. If you really want to watch something without dialogue watch Willy's Wonderland (Skip Five Nights AT Freddy's). If you wanted to watch something that talks about the last performance with animatronics and a demonic computer hack system and went on a decent path, watch The Banana Splits Movie (Skip Five Nights AT Freddy's). This is a 3/10 it's not like I hated the movie with hot relish and/or two hours lost it did however have positive factors but nothing that would make me feel enjoyable.",2023-10-26

"This looked to be a really good horror and certainly started off well enough, so I began watching in some anticipation.It doesn't take long before you realise this film doesn't know if it's a horror, a ghost story or a suspense thriller (and nor does the audience)As predictable as a Scooby Doo Cartoon (complete with the actor who played shaggy in the film)It ruins the good start with lots of WTF? Plot holes.The big failing is using writers who clearly think the audience are idiots. Who won't ask silly questions like 'how did 5 bodies and all the blood and gore get cleared up? Or this was portrayed as supernatural now it's become mechanical - which is it.The writing is lazy and glib, throw in a nasty auntie because they can't think of any more credible reasons for X and Y to happenIt starts off respectably enough but you soon realise it's garbage .

Well a meeting with the enigmatic police officer ""Vanessa"" (Elizabeth Lail) should have rung alarm bells, and when he has to take ""Abby"" there for one overnight shift - well it's soon clear that this place has secrets to keep and that it knows how to manipulate the hopes and fears of ""Mike"" and his sister. Can they stay sane and focussed long enough to survive this maze of malevolent mechanical bunnies? I'm afraid the presence of Matthew Lillard never helps a film, and here is no different - this is just a rather nonsensical attempt at a spooky mystery that certainly has nothing to make you jump. Rubio is actually quite decent, but there's isn't enough else happening to compensate for the very slow build up, surfeit of dialogue and frankly rather silly underlying premiss. I suppose as Halloween gets bigger and bigger, we are going to get more and more of these mediocre offerings - but despite it's more prominent cast, this just belongs on the Horror channel at 2am.",2023-11-02
"Before I review this movie, I want to point out that I haven't played or owned any of the Five Nights at Freddy's games so I won't compare the movie to the games at all. With that out of the way, let's see what this movie was and was it worth the hype?Eh. I like horror movies and this sort of captured that horror feeling but not a lot. Matthew Lillard was somewhat okay but I was underwhelmed by his performance considering I was excited to see him in this movie. The CGI is good, I can't say it's perfect but it is practically a replica of the characters in the games from what I've seen. I know I've mentioned Lillard's performance so I won't glance over that again but what I will say is the acting in this movie is below average, mostly because the bad actors get more screen time, like the security guard (you may think he's good but I don't) and the child actors who try and I'll give them props for that but like most child actors are mediocre at best. I like the plot but the execution lets it down via the acting. I reckon if it wasn't as hyped as it was, Five Nights at Freddy's would be an okay movie, nothing special about it, but considering the popularity of FNAF and the hype this movie got, I was disappointed with the movie and I think I shouldn't play the games if they were a carbon copy of the movie. I would watch it if you like FNAF but if you don't, then I would pass.3/10.",2023-10-30
"First of all, the costumes and the set were great, I didn't have any issue with the acting (big fan of Josh and Matthew) and it was amazing to see the game kind of come to life on screen. I understand that one has to make some modifications to the original source, but I feel like the reason why movies or series made of loved videogames fall short is because they very often become so different from the original source and either add or change story lines that don't require any change, which just makes it weird for the viewer if they happen to be a fan.I think producers and directors should have learnt from the last of us adaptation, since it's one of the most well received adaptations like this. When you make this kind of content for the fans, use the source they already love. I'm probably going to see the second movie if they do end up making it, I'm not gonna lie, because I love the games and I wish the next one would be catered towards the fans who have waited years for this sort of a movie.I think the movie is still worth a watch, esprecially if you go into the movie expecting more of a humoristic spooky movie, don't really care about the details of the games and just want to see the animatronics come to life, I'm sure you'll enjoy it more! I just might have had a bit unrealistic expectations and the hype around the movie got to me.",2023-10-25
"This movie was a HUGE disappointment. Five Nights at Freddy fan or not you will be massively confused as to what is even going on. The film is very disjointed and the half assed story was poorly conveyed and extremely Cliché. If you are thrilled by the power of friendship saving the day you will love this movie. If you love a comedic PG adaptation of one of the most horrific stories of child murder and possession you will also love this movie. But if you love to watch quality movies with tonnes of care put into them, containing an original and engaging story, maybe go watch netflix instead.This film could have easily been improved if it wasn't desperately trying to target 7 year olds, despite most pf the fanbase being adults or in their late teens by now. It should have been an origin story for the animatronics, not a romantic comedy, teen, summer fun loving movie.Biggest disappointment in a while.",2023-10-27
"Absolutely not worth the cinema experience I can tell you. And look, I'm generous when it comes to rating movies sometimes...so I gave it a 2. IT WAS SO BAD, don't get me wrong I like fnaf ,not like those obsessed fans though. So all the ratings you see here with like above 6 stars, they're absolutely too obsessed to even notice the cringy scenes.Hats off to the guy who made the movie trailer, that was impressive, nothing like the movie though.I'm not so hard to scare, couldn't even go past night 3 on the mobile game so when I say this was like a walk in the park, believe me. I didn't even jump once...
Damn, I could've made a better movie... mmm... maybe someday...",2023-10-28
"We sure didn't since we have Peacock. Simply one of the most laughable horror movies of all time. All the deaths except for one are off screen. Least that we saw since we FF it after a mind numbing hour of nothingness with only a couple of ludicrous deaths. There is no horror except of course having to watch this in a theatre. The laughable monsters are so ridiculous looking that I couldn't stop laughing. Josh is no leading man material and to see his boring countenance nearly the whole movie is unbearable. How this made so much money opening weekend is mystifying but hey I watched tons of awful movies when I was a teenager myself. There are no scares, no good effects; certainly no good deaths. I expect a precipitous drop next week in the box office. Awful awful awful.",2023-10-30
"When I first started watching the movie, it drew me in with its visuals and intrigue. However, when I reached the end of the film, I truly couldn't believe how poorly they concluded it.First of all, the makeup, costumes, and visuals were quite good. But apart from that, the other elements were not satisfying at all.I couldn't understand why they tried to commercialize the script. The idea of finding children's spirits inside robotic monsters was just unbelievable. Also, the character Vanessa, who didn't do her job throughout the film but was only involved in the events because her father was in charge, really dragged the film down. Let me first address what I initially mentioned. Whoever came up with the idea of searching for his brother in a dream and communicating with the child spirits inside robotic monsters did a really bad job. Instead of turning this into more of a detective thriller and strengthening the family drama (now I'm moving on to the second point, Vanessa), they gave Vanessa's character a very simple and elementary-level script connection to her father, William Afton. The absence of police in the events or the incomplete presentation of any mystery element is a total disaster for the film. Like I said, if they had turned this material into a detective-style thriller, they would have created a much stronger film.In short, the movie,although visually beautiful, was ruined by an unsuccessful script that tested my patience and tried to be meta but couldn't. You can see this from the ratings on all movie review sites. Our time is precious and this movie is not worth it.",2023-10-29
"I went in with high expectations for this film and I truly believe it was so much better than I imagined. They really brought the games to life. There were twists and oh my god moments when watching, plus there were many other themes highlighted in the film not just the pizzeria which I really enjoyed, it kept the film more real, maybe more relatable.I'd like to have known more about what happened after but I'm not too fussed with that as there most likely will be a sequel that ties loose ends.Watching this brought so many memories of me playing the games when I was young, young me was jumping in my seat, it felt like young me and present me really connected.",2023-10-25
"I love horror games and FNAF although I haven't played them all that much, was always high on my list for top scariest games I've ever played. So this movie should be right up my ally right? Well not in this case. The movie focuses on hitting that feature film length so much that you get a jumbled story with so much going on that the movie ends up just leaving you behind. Oh and Animatronics we're great for the 5 minutes they were on screen.The characters are not interesting at all and that's a shame because we are stuck following the main character Mike through un interesting repetitive dream sequences that lead to nothing. The others acted in such an non human way, it throws you out of the illusion.This movie had a story already written out that scared so many people already, why they didn't just stick to that and flesh out the already told story is beyond me. They need to tone it down and stick to what they already have if they plan on doing anything else with the franchise.",2023-10-29
"I have been a fan of the Fnaf franchise for years and like most fans, I've been waiting patiently for this movie to release for many years. Now that the movie finally released after 8 years of being in development, I finally got to watch the movie in theaters with one of my friends. Despite my friend enjoying the film, I personally left the film feeling incredibly underwhelmed and disappointed.Now, this film does have good elements, but I feel a lot of the bad outweigh the good. Firstly, the story in this film is really dull. I thought the film started solid but everything else after the beginning was dull, especially the side plot in the film. The movie is barely scary, the moments that tried to be scary literally made me laugh. The animatronics were the best part of the film... when they were actually a threat. I understand most of the lore in the games but what they did with the animatronics half way through rubbed me the wrong way. The actors in the film were okay but not outstanding. Same goes for the characters. Josh Hutcherson was solid as Mike but I kind found his character generic. Matthew Lillard was probably the best part of the movie, it's just a shame he was only in the film for only about 10 minutes. The setting for the film was cool but I knew I was gonna most likely like it. The ending to the film felt honestly rushed, would've benefited if it was a bit longer. The film could've also benefited from an R rating instead of PG-13.Overall, while I don't think the movie was terrible, I don't think it is good at all and was incredibly underwhelming. I am gonna be being completely honest, Scott Cawthon should not have wrote the screenplay. I would've preferred if someone else wrote the screenplay and Scott was a co writer or just a producer. Personally, I would only recommend this movie if you are a die hard Fnaf fan. Outside of that, I would skip this movie all together.",2023-11-01
"This could have been so much better. If the acting had more heart and the storyline was better written. It was cliche after cliche. Can't writers come up with something new, ever? It's like there's not even a need for writers anymore because they all tell the same story in one way or another. It's incredibly monotonous having to watch the same thing being told over and over. I guess they say around and said what can we take from every movie ever and throw it together in a poor fashion. I gave it 3 stars for the cinematography and the special effects. Don't waste your time, you've seen this before.",2023-10-28
"This movie appears to use the same animatrons and sets as Willy's Wonderland, only this movie is really bad.Nic Cage's movie was fun and gory. This movie is downright dumb. I have zero knowledge of the video game, but I had a hard time following the plot.Mainly because it's a very, very, very boring movie. The entire first half has no action. Then when the action clicks in, it's disappointing.The writing is really poor and the direction worse. I can't say much about the acting because the actors don't have much to work with.Frankly, I was shocked at how much this looked like Willy's Wonderland! Only no where near as good.",2023-10-29
"My son was obsessed with the games back in middle school and I watched a good bit of the game play. Now as an 18 yr old saw he saw it a couple of nights ago. He had a good review so I watched it on Peacock, we both agree visually it was flawless 10/10 and if you're familiar with the storyline in the games it does follow it but adds more to it to flesh it out, also for the original fans there are a lot of Easter eggs dropped in as well as fan work such as the music came from fans, he said you could tell the true fans in the theater when a song played and half the theater cheered simply because they recognized and added it. I liked the keeping with the main story and was so so with the added bits. If you loved the games there's a lot to like but if you are unfamiliar and just are watching as a stand alone movie you probably won't like it as much. Over all he gave it a 9/10, I gave it a 6-7/10.",2023-10-28
"Five Nights at Freddy's, the highly anticipated adaptation of the popular video game series, has finally made its way to the silver screen. As a big fan of the original games, I approached this release with great enthusiasm, hoping for a bone-chilling, suspenseful experience that would do justice to its gaming origins. However, much to my dismay, this cinematic endeavor left much to be desired. Despite a few redeeming qualities, I regret to say that the final product only deserves a 4/10 rating.The film, directed by a promising newcomer in the industry, had the potential to be a horror masterpiece. The premise, which centers around a security guard surviving nights at a haunted animatronic-filled pizzeria, was ripe for suspense and terror. Sadly, it fell flat in execution, leaving me longing for the scares that never came.One of the biggest disappointments of Five Nights at Freddy's was the lackluster character development. The film introduced a cast of intriguing characters, from the tormented security guard to the mysterious animatronics. However, their potential was squandered, and we were left with underdeveloped, two-dimensional figures who lacked depth and personality. We needed a reason to care about their fates, but it never came.Moreover, the film's pacing was sluggish. While the games are known for their slow-building tension, the movie felt like an interminable waiting game, much like the protagonist's nightly vigil. Instead of suspense, we were subjected to long stretches of monotony, punctuated by occasional, tepid jump-scares that failed to evoke the heart-pounding fear we hoped for.Speaking of jump-scares, this is where the film truly faltered. The jump-scares were lukewarm at best. In a horror movie, these moments should be used to jolt the audience out of their seats, leaving them breathless and terrified. Unfortunately, Five Nights at Freddy's seemed to mistake repetition for effectiveness. The animatronics' predictable and lackluster appearances drained the film of any shock value. It was a missed opportunity to genuinely scare the audience.The film's lack of innovation in its presentation was a significant letdown. While the source material is known for its unique and eerie atmosphere, the movie failed to capture that same sense of dread. The pizzeria, a central element of the story, felt uninspired, and the film lacked the creepy ambiance that made the games so unsettling. The creators could have drawn inspiration from the games to create a more immersive and visually arresting experience, but it felt like a wasted opportunity.Five Nights at Freddy's also suffered from a disjointed and incoherent narrative. The film hopped between different time periods and perspectives, leaving viewers confused and detached from the story. It was as if the filmmakers were trying to cram too much of the game's lore into a single film, resulting in a messy and convoluted plot. It was difficult to invest in the story when it lacked cohesion and clarity.The film's visuals, while decent, failed to stand out in the crowded genre of horror. The animatronics, despite being a central element of the story, looked more comical than terrifying. The use of practical effects was commendable, but their execution left much to be desired. A sense of eeriness and uncanny valley realism was missing, leaving a significant void in the horror department.One aspect of the film that did shine was the soundtrack. The haunting and discordant score created an atmosphere of unease, which was one of the few elements that managed to maintain the tension in certain scenes. The music, composed by a talented artist, was a testament to the film's potential, but it alone couldn't salvage the entire project.In the end, Five Nights at Freddy's was a missed opportunity in the world of horror cinema. With the right direction, character development, pacing, and innovative presentation, it could have been a genre-defining masterpiece. Unfortunately, it fell short of those expectations, delivering a lukewarm experience that left me yearning for the true terror and suspense that the source material promises.In conclusion, the film was a disappointment to fans of the game series and casual moviegoers alike. It lacked the necessary elements to make it a compelling and truly horrifying experience. With a more skillful adaptation, it could have been a standout entry in the horror genre. However, as it stands, Five Nights at Freddy's deserves a 4/10 rating, reflecting its inability to fulfill its potential and deliver the scares that audiences were hoping for.",2023-10-30
"Then you will hate every second of this movie! I keep hearing ooooh the movie was soooo goood it just like the game if you are true fan! Blah blah blah blah they are all lying out thier a$$. None of them played the game! Cause this is nothing like the game. It has the characters that's about it. They also change the lore with Afton family. Mike or guy playing him you could tell he did not want to be there, especially those scenes when he is talking to Vanessa out in the parking lot. The whole custody battle for his little sister which if that's his little sister then his parents had Abby in thier 50s probably. Then Mike sleeps through a lot of the film and you have to watch all these dream sequences that make no sense like the little kid ghosts are talking to me in my dreams it was just dumb and not scary at all. Like the reviews before me it had no jump scares. All the kills happen off screen this film was a total let down if you are a true fan of 5 nights at Freddy's.",2023-11-01
"The story for this movie is inept. Instead of just using the idea of kid friendly animatronics going hay wire and running amok, they went with this complex paranormal murder mystery story. I get that this is based on the graphic novels and not the games lore, but that doesn't justify this movies poor plot. There's very little horror and action. The characters spend most of their time chatting and arguing. It wasn't towards the end where it started feeling the games where the animatronics turn hostile and began attacking the human characters. Mathew Lillards character Afton is a poorly written villain. He only appeared in three scenes and just pops up in the end and we're supposed to be shocked that he was the children's killer. There were no hints or buildup at all to him being the killer but the character Vanessa reveals that she's his daughter and tells us everything we need to know about what her Dads crimes right before he comes out to kill Mike. It's also worth pointing out that Vanessa's last name is Kelly and she doesn't even have the last name as her Dad. Which is why we never saw the daughter plot twist coming. It also doesn't make sense how exactly Afton has control over the children's ghosts and is able to manipulate them into killing. In his final scene, Afton realizes that he's about to get his comeuppance from the animatronics and yells out ""I always come back!!"" For some reason the plot tries to make Afton out to be some kind of supernatural villain who can't be killed. It also doesn't make sense how the animatronics didn't know that Afton was the killer. Mikes little sister Abby had to draw a picture to explain to them that Afton was their killer to turn against him. I also can't figure out why Afton hired Mike as the night guard for his restaurant. I thought perhaps he wanted to lure him in there so he could kill him in privacy. But if that's the case then why did he wait five nights to do it? He also berates his daughter for failing to keep everything a secret from Mike and refusing to kill him if he found out the truth. Which makes me doubt that killing him himself was his motive.",2023-11-01
"It was...interesting. It started off strong, but then got lost when trying to implement horror elements. The result is an underwhelming and half-baked ""horror"". Despite being lackluster, the film is still worth a watch as it does not fail to entertain. Due to the silly nature of shots, scenes, and acting, you will be sure to forget that it is not a comedy flick. The acting performances were less than stellar, sad to say that includes Matthew Lillard. The film has its charm, and is sure to become a cult classic in the following years. All in all, it is a campy comedy and technically a horror, albeit hindered by its pg13 rating.",2023-10-27
"OK, I admit it, I've never played the game but have got a 10 year old nephew who is incredibly excited to see this film because he loves the characters. I have to surmise that the games involve sneaking around the diner while avoiding the menacing glare of the animatronics?To be fair most studios who try to adapt what makes computer games so successful onto the screen fail. I'm thinking of you Street Fighter 2, The Last of Us, Super Mario Brothers, Tomb Raider, Mortal Kombat, *The Witcher, Resident Evil - the problem is that playing a game is incredibly immersive, as should be watching a film, and video games have much, much more license to take their time in getting you to bond with the character and story you're telling.I digress, massively. Basically, FNaF's is slow, boring, predictable. You do not spend any time with the monsters (hardly) and I get the feeling the storytellers couldn't decide if we, the audience, were supposed to sympathise with them, or fear them.",2023-11-01
"When I saw this, I was excited. I mean, who didn't like Chucky or Annabelle right?! Another story about killer toys! Well, let me start by saying it wasnt like that. The story line was allover the place, the toys were such a disappointment and the plot has just riddled with holes. The characters were boring and had no real substance to who they are, but I think that came from the story.The opening scene had promise, but when the story unfolded, they seemed to dwell on unneeded parts of the story. The supporting characters were pointless as well. Like an Aunt who had about as much to do with the story as a toilet seat. I think there was only one point I jumped and there was next to no gore at all.Worth a watch, but don't get too excited.",2023-11-01
"Absolute garbage, not funny, not scary. Just not enjoyable.No clear storyline, no likeable characters, predicatable as hell.It was so boring, it felt like it was on for about 3 hours, it just wouldn't end.The costumes/animatronics were good but very underused.I had just watched exorcist believer and thought that this year's halloween movies couldn't possibly get any worse but then I saw this and realised, yes things could sink even further, a lot further.Let's hope this put and end to this franchise before it gets going. I couldn't possibly sit through this or anything like it ever again.",2023-10-29
"Even with the creator involved in the process, this movie did not feel like a FNAF story, or what made the original game so fun and interesting. I do have to give ""props"" to the animatronics, as it look eerily accurate, but that's about where the similarities end sadly. The main story involving the main character is uninteresting, it's light on scares, the acting from the adults were very iffy (except Futterman, he always does a good job). I understand adopting a game story to a movie is difficult, but the plot is nearly nonsensical. Even if you can get past all that and at least expected a decent fun horror fest, the scariest thing was easily handled by some water and taser, and the main baddie was just a guy in a costume with a design flaw.",2023-10-30
"It was fine until exactly 1 hour and 10 minutes, when the generic exposition cop woman randomly threatened to shoot the main character for no reason whatsoever. Until then I was like ""this is fine - fan service, a predictable insertion of tons of female characters because it's the 2020s, a kids rating, so no violence, but that doesn't necessarily make it bad, so overall - nothing too surprising or bad.""But yeah, the cringe factor got cranked up so hard in those 5 seconds that I legit stopped watching it, because I lost all interest, this is bad. I should've expected it to be cringe and misandrist considering it's proudly directed by the same woman who made M3gan, I guess, but I did expect some competence.But yeah, overall, it's a really bland and generic movie based on a game that had no lore whatsoever until a youtuber pulled some out of his rear end for views, singlehandedly creating some (bad one).That same youtuber also has a really corny cameo, I guess for the kids to cheer over, but... yeah...Cringe.To be fair, though, the visual presentation is great, and the acting is surprisingly good, at least from the main guy. He goes above and beyond with what he gets to work with - a silly movie with a ridiculous plot - but he carries his weight and shows a great range of emotion throughout. Too bad his efforts were wasted in a movie this bad.",2023-10-28
"""Five Nights at Freddy's"" is a movie adaptation that disappoints in comparison to the gripping video game series it's based on. While the animatronics and the core premise remain intriguing, the film's lack of character development, disjointed storytelling, and inconsistent horror elements hinder its potential. Fans of the games might appreciate seeing the characters on the big screen, but the film fails to fully capture the essence of what made the franchise so captivating. It's a missed opportunity to delve deeper into the lore and fear-inducing elements of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. While it's not without its merits, ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" falls short of its potential and earns a modest 5/10 🌟",2023-11-01
"First off I would like to say I have never played the games but I watched the game theory videos when I was younger and thought the lore was interesting but never got too into the franchise. Despite this I genuinely enjoyed the film. The horror in the film is more like security breach where there are jump-scares but they are very predictable and not too scary. The plot is really where the movie shines, it's surprisingly sweet and had me hooked. The ending could have been better and felt rushed but thats only the real part that felt that way and everything else was great. There is so much here for longtime fans of the franchise and I think that you will really enjoy this if you love the games. ""Tl;dr"" critic reviews made it seem terrible when it's not that bad.",2023-10-27
"FNaF is a goofy parody of Chuck E. Cheese which took campy horror themes and made a fun and scary game. This movie shifts the tone to a serious family drama, which removed pretty much all fun and comedy from the story. Small jokes are made tongue-in-cheek and we laugh at some common painful experiences we've all had, but overall, it missed the vibe of the game. Another version did a better job of referring to the game and its elements while translating the campy element of the game into campy movie elements. It may have been simpler, but it was closer to the games.. Honestly this movie was more like Doctor Sleep. I'll probably rewatch the Willie's Wonderland movie to get the taste of this one out of my mind.",2023-10-27
"The fact that a FNAF movie even happened is just amazing on its own. I am sure lots of people just wanted something to come out just to have the FNAF name out there (they waited 8 years). It is very cool that it happened but due to a very inexperienced director and Scott Cawthon and others not having much experience in working on movies, it couldn't reach it's full potential.The FNAF franchise has so much great lore and material but a lot of it wasn't used. I'll start with the positives: the animatronics/puppets look fantastic, Jim Henson's team did an amazing job on them. They look about as true to the games as you can get. The cameos of certain people influential to this franchise were very nice to see and some parts were pretty funny. Josh Hutcherson did well as Mike and the guy playing Yellow Bunny (can't remember his name at the moment, he played Shaggy in the Scooby-Doo movies) was also good. The cons of this movie are really all based on the dialogue, writing, editing and directing. Some of the scenes are extremely awkward and even the best actors can't do much with such bad dialogue like there was in this movie. There are some shots that cut away too quickly. Lots of plot holes and sudden shifts in mood and setting that don't make much sense. We don't really get to take our time with the characters and understand them. I know this is supposed to be a simple movie and not a deep one but we should have some sense of their personalities than what was provided. The animatronics weren't as scary as they could have been and they are very scary in the games. The movie just can't decide if it's actually a horror movie or not at times. Overall, this movie had a lot of potential but it just couldn't reach it fully.",2023-10-29
"Boring, uninteresting schlop that offers incredibly little for those who are already fans of the games and absolutely nothing for those who aren't. I can genuinely not see any reason someone might enjoy this amateurish nothing burger of a movie other than because of a knee jerk positive reaction to seeing matpat or Freddy fazbear or the other animatronics on screen. Just a movie pumped out to grab some extra dollars for the owners and film companies by capitalizing on a name that will be forgotten as soon as it leaves theatres. I'd skip this one, it is not worth your time no matter what you think of the games or the property.",2023-10-28
"I was ready to really love this movie having played and been terrorized by the game on occulus, but what a massive let down. It starts out with some horror promise, but this quickly deflates once the main characters and story come into play. My main question was- was this written during the writers strike by stand ins because omg. What. A. Mess. The dialog and acting borders the ridiculous and then pole vaults waaaaay over it once ""Vanessa"" arrives on the scene. What is wrong with this character? Her lines, moods, and acting is ALL over the map! Calm and demure one second, then with her very next sentence is ready to murder. ROFL! People in our theater were laughing after every one of her completely over-the-top lines and not in a good way either. She was an absurd character with almost zero purpose other than to provide poorly written plot exposition and unintentional comedy. ""If you bring Abby back here, I will SHOOT you."" Comic gold offered up with complete seriousness- this line had our theater in stitches. One of M. Night Shyamalan's over the top disastrous characters would be hard pressed to keep up w/ ol' Vanessa's ""acting"" lol!The rest is a forgettable mess of wretched acting, boring family drama, boring pacing, a needlessly convoluted ""plot"", and lukewarm ""horror"". Honestly this felt like a throwaway movie of the week by a first time director. Nothing to offer. Josh Hutcherson's done much better and it was sad to see him in such a turd of a film. Maybe it will reach cult popularity due to its awfulness and stupidity a-La Rocky Horror, but even that'd be a stretch. Avoid it unless it's streaming and you need to numb your brain.",2023-11-01
"As a fan of the franchise I can confirm that this movie is absolutely fantastic, I'm pretty critical when it comes to movies but yet I still absolutely loved the movie. I do have some small complaints though, one of the complaints I have is I hoped to see more of William Afton in the movie but besides that I'm very happy with what we received from this movie. I actually understand why critics rated this movie low, and that reason is that they aren't fans of the franchise. If you have always been a fan of this franchise then you will likely love this movie, overall I'm super excited to see the second movie when it releases!",2023-10-26

Anyways I love how this reminded me of 3 other movies Sinister which is masterful but much darker than Five Nights at Freddy's, the other 2 are Scream and Nightmare on elm street the Similarities are brilliant plus I don't know much about the video games I'm pretty sure the director perfected everything based on the games. The terror is great, story flows well, cast is superb, comedy is awesome, and to me a lot of the movie is spectacular!",2023-10-26
"This movie was hands down one of the worst, most boring films I've ever paid to watch. No plot, no intense scenes, no horror scenes. Everyone in the movie has no common sense and the little girl is literally a moron. The little girl becomes beasties with the animatronics, how stupid. Average acting. He man lives in a good house but is broke. They had some humor but it was short lasting. The plot of the movie too its sweet time developing. The movie is so low and the movie it's even focused on the robots and the original lore. If you are a five nights at Freddy's fan, do not waste you time and money on this movie.",2023-10-29
"If you have zero knowledge about the games this is a nice watch (if you don't think much), however if you do it will be both confusing an disappointing (Do still watch it though),Firstly, all the characters and family relationships are really mixed up, all of William Afton's motives for killing children is gone. For some reason Vanessa is William's daughter instead of Mike, who had his younger brother Garrett (supposedly CC) kidnapped (what?!?) and is taking care of his sister Abby (who?!?). What I mean is fnaf has very (VERY) deep and confusing lore, but the writers had Scott to ask questions, there were a lot of good stories opportunities about what is already known about the stories (like following mike going from restaurant to restaurant, etc).Even if you don't know the franchise, there are a lot of plot holes, like the five children are in the animatronics (freddy, bonnie, chica, foxy, and I guess cupcake?), but where did Garrett go? Why are some children in animatronics and other not. Also, why would William want to employ Mike? He had no reason to kill him, is it just for fun orrr???I enjoyed the movie, the acting is nice and its well filmed, it isn't scary, but it's not bad. It went above my expectations (they were really low), except in that one scene where the animatronics are all laying down in the ""tent"", that was the only real horror in the movie... Anyways, I think Mike is a good character, but Vanessa is useless and only there for exposition and ""HE IS MY FATHER!!!"".I say watch it and make your own opinion about it.",2023-10-27
"I'll try and keep this brief and spoiler free as possible but too say this is bad is a understatement, it's a absolute disappointment to any merits of filmmakingThe ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" movie, based on the popular video game franchise, fails to deliver the scares and excitement one would expect from such a beloved source material.From the get-go, the movie's pacing is completely off, with a slow and tedious build-up that lacks any real tension or intrigue. The audience is left waiting for something interesting to happen, but unfortunately, that moment never comes.The characters are underdeveloped and uninteresting, making it difficult to feel any sense of connection or sympathy for their plight. The performances are wooden and lack any real depth, further adding to the movie's overall lack of appeal.The special effects and animatronics, which should have been the movie's saving grace, are surprisingly subpar. The animatronics lack the creepiness and realism that made the video game so frightening, instead coming off as cheap and unconvincing.Moreover, the film fails to capture the essence of what made the video game franchise so popular in the first place. The suspenseful gameplay, the eerie atmosphere, and the intricate backstory are all lost in translation, leaving fans of the franchise disappointed and frustrated.In conclusion, the ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" movie is a massive letdown. With its lackluster performances, poor special effects, and failure to capture the essence of the source material, this film is not worth your time or money.",2023-10-28
"Five Nights At Freddy's sounded fun at first. A comedic horror film with killer robotic animals. It's like chucky cheeses murder style!!!! Well I hate to say this but, this movie isnt how I expected it to be! Everyone in this film was good with performances! Some moments are just plain stupid. For my personal opinion, It's an unfunny, non scary, horror film that tries too hard to be scary and funny! It's good for younger people bc it's not intense but this movie was flat as anything for me and extremely boring. I feel bad for the actors bc trying to be scared of robotic teddy bears and crap is RIDICULOUS!",2023-10-28
"In addition to the plot not connecting, full of tiring and unnecessary plots, How the infinite repetition of the protagonist's dreams that lead nowhere only makes the film even more boring, the film also takes itself very seriously, which makes it even more embarrassing for others, The title doesn't even make sense ""five nights at Freddy's"", on some nights in that pizzeria the protagonist and the police officer don't do anything relevant, they just chat for the film to make it longer,The entire plot could be summarized in 3 minutes, FNAF fans are used to mediocre content that's why they liked this movie.",2023-10-30
"Just finished watching Five Night's at Freddy's at home. The movie, CONCEPTUALLY was so good. Having played FNAF since it first came out in 2014, I was so excited to see the adaptation for the movie 9 years later. If you are like me, DO NOT get your hopes up.The movie plot had potential, but was boiled down to a cheesy thriller that had maybe four or five callbacks to the incredibly extensive lore that Scott Cawthon established over the years with the Five Night's at Freddy's game series. I believe the PG-13 rating suits it perfectly- very VERY little gore, no drugs, no drinking, etc. So, if you are watching for the story-line alone, I would say it's not a good watch for you unless you are a younger teenager looking for a fun thriller with a few scary scenes.The visuals, however, were INCREDIBLE. Truly, I could not imagine a better real-life interpretation of the animatronics. You can look up the animatronic pictures online and get a good feel of how amazing they are. Not sure I would recommend the movie for the visuals.Overall, Five Night's at Freddy's is an incredibly below average thriller film with phenomenal visuals. The plot barely scratches the surface of the lore behind the entire game series. Not worth the watch.",2023-10-30
"I can't even start to describe how bored I was watching this. I'm not a fan of video games, so I've had no idea what this movie was going to be about. I didn't even know that was based on a video game, if I knew I would probably just skipped it.I thought it was going to be like that movie with Nicolas Cage something Wonderland, but then it reminded me of another one with the Banana Splits that was supposed to be horror. I don't remember their names, but I'm sure they made more sense than this one.One thing is boring, but this was boring and stupid.Can't care less about a sequel tho it seems that there's going to be one.",2023-10-27
"My videogame experience is so minimal and consistently out of date that the colloquial term ""casual"" is probably too intensive to describe me. With that in mind, and with much more significant interest in cinema, I approached this strictly with concern for how it would come off as a full-length feature, and as a horror feature, with its gaming roots no more than a tertiary curiosity for me. Illustrating the point, I was less interested about any faithfulness as an adaptation than I was about comparing this 2023 flick to 2019's 'The Banana Splits movie,' and 2021's 'Willy's Wonderland,' both of which work with a very similar concept, and about seeing where this fit into the oeuvre of filmmaker Emma Tammi, as by happenstance I've seen all her previous work in the genre. And still all such matters are beside the point: how is 'Five night's at Freddy's?' I had my doubts, but in every regard this is a lot of fun, and it ably delivers the genre flavors we crave; for my part I'm happy to say that I think this is actually really great!I'll say this, it's definitely not what I expected; for the different directions that this took I admit I was a little taken aback. I think the end result does struggle a bit: with tone, with cohesiveness, with pacing, and possibly with feeling a tad common for the path it does walk, while not taking full advantage of the principal imagery (and game mechanics) for which the game franchise is best known (even for an outsider like me). We do certainly get tastes of the animatronics stalking the halls of the restaurant and playhouse, and with smart use of (among other things) lighting, cinematography, editing, and stunts and effects, these scenes are meaningfully creepy and sinister. Yet this is actually the least of what FNAF pursues in its narrative, and while I'm told that the plot does draw on what I gather is the jumbled lore of the games, the various elements it weaves in seem imbalanced and unwieldy. We get flavors of straight horror-thriller, psychological thriller, and supernatural horror; the flick spends just as much or maybe even more time delving into the troubled personal life of protagonist Mike - his past trauma, his shoddy work history, his difficult relationship with his sister, and more. This is all part of a complete story, yes, but in the front end the telling comes across as confused, and in the back end it's overfull and strained as the script tries to neatly tie together all the varied pieces. However much this does or doesn't correlate to the videogame franchise, I think the film maybe just tries to do too much, and it might have benefited from some aspects having been left out.Even with these critiques firmly in mind, however, by and large 'Five nights at Freddy's' is gratifyingly sharp, and it's genuinely better than I could have hoped. It's readily evident how much care went into this from every angle, an endeavor to make the adaptation the best it could be, and to make something that could appeal to all comers. And just so: my friends who are deeply invested in the games told me that they were happy with the picture in terms of its relation to the source material; in my opinion it's solid and satisfying in and of itself as a horror picture. With the Jim Henson Creature Shop having crafted the animatronics, there could never be any doubt that Freddy and his friends look outstanding, and for that matter - not to count out anyone else's contributions, but they might well be the top highlight in these two hours. The stunts, effects, and art direction are top notch, and bring to vibrant life the aesthetics that anyone with passing awareness of the games will recognize in an instant. And while I'm not especially familiar with anyone in the cast, I'm very pleased with just how good the acting is here. Josh Hutcherson, Elizabeth Lail, and even young Piper Rubio, among others, give meaningful weight and human heart to their characters and in turn to the proceedings; even as the tale oscillates between ideas, the actors serve as an anchor to help keep the title steady amidst any perceived difficulties.It's worth observing that while 'Willy's Wonderland' was an unremitting, unabashed horror-comedy romp, 'The Banana Splits movie' took a different tack and rooted those same flavors in an earnest sidelong exploration of the relationship between mother and child, and the significance of childhood innocence - while also, regrettably, lacking the utmost punch that would have helped its horror or comedy to land. I bring this up because FNAF fits rather neatly between these two spiritual predecessors: more grounded and earnest than the riotous Nicolas Cage vehicle, and boasting more vitality than the Hanna-Barbera blast. The writing team concocted an amalgamated story and a screenplay that try to split the difference between humor, violence, and heartfelt beats, and while none of these are specifically as strong as in the kindred flicks, the result is a fine success all the same, warts and all. For the genre purists in the audience, I would even argue that of the three FNAF might well offer the most pure horror experience. Employing the same finessed, delicate hand that she demonstrated even in first full-length feature 'The wind,' in 2018, or in 2021's 'Blood moon,' director Tammi swirls these facets together as smoothly as she can to keep the whole centered. The carnage may not be as visceral or heavily visualized, the emotional beats may not hit as hard, and the humor may not be as robust as we get elsewhere, yet the combination of them all is admirably sure-footed. Even if I hadn't previously dallied with Tammi's other works, on the basis of this alone I look forward to watching her career develop.For any number of reasons this won't appeal to all, and for any number of reasons it will not meet with equal favor among all. Videogame connoisseur, film buff, ""casual"" appreciator of fiction generally - there are a lot of ways to consider this, and there are a lot of ways it could have gone wrong (and may have, depending on one's perspective). All I know is that I wasn't entirely sure what to expect when I sat in the theater, and even though I don't think it's perfect, the strength it can claim handily outweighs its faults and shortcomings. I had a swell time with this, and think it ably scratches the itch for whatever it is one might want out of horror entertainment. I really am of the mind that it's something anyone could appreciate, whatever level of familiarity with the games one might bring to the viewing experience. It's not something that wholly demands viewership, but it stands tall on its own legs, and if one has any passing interest then it's well worth checking out. 'Five nights at Freddy's' is a minor delight as far as I'm concerned, and I'm glad to give it my recommendation!",2023-10-27
"Written by Ian Chandler - November 2, 2023Almost a decade after the first ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" video-game won the attention of the internet, Scott Cawthon finally adapts his beloved horror franchise into a motion picture. Fantasy and fun come to life with its impressive practical effects and even more impressive budget. Even so, the film gets lost when translated from its spooky, but tween friendly games. It, most fatally, completely forgets its most famous trademarks: suspense and jump scares. It should not be expected to be a work of art, but at the very least, the screenplay should not leave all of the heavy-lifting to the production team.As mentioned previously, those who produced the visual aspects of ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" are exceptional on ensuring that the pizzeria is how a fan would imagine it. It's dark, dusty, but also colorful. The technology in the abandoned pizzeria is appropriately dated. Additionally, in an industry so reliant on the use of CGI, it was refreshing to see Freddy and his pals as real animatronics. So much love and care were put into the world Scott Cawthon created that it stings a bit more that the film's other elements are as empty as an animatronics' endoskeleton.The plot is not as bad as it could have been, but it still never feels polished, nor fresh. It features an upsetting story about a sad protagonist, with tragedies brought up throughout. It is accurate in many ways to the plot of the third game; unfortunately, plot points are brought up repeatably without much progression in order to satisfy the nearly two-hour runtime. When plot elements demand for more substance, they are sidelined for the recurring objective put in place, resulting in an abrupt ending overall and a lack of resolution for certain parts that happen near the end. Characters during the first two acts are serviceable with some good acting, most notably from Josh Hutcherson. When the second act starts to close, the dialogue becomes increasingly wooden and the actors try their best to combat the lackluster script by conveying emotion in the tired phrases given to them.Despite the forgettable plot and uneven characters, a horror film can usually stand on two feet if it provides what they promise: suspense. This, strangely, is where the movie is at its weakest. There is not a second where one's heartrate rises, nor is there a moment to cling on to the seat in fear. The animatronics, furthermore, are too expressive compared to their video-game counterparts; this results in impressive facial movements, but a less impressive method of intimidation. Part of what made the games creepy was their lack of visual movement and their corpse-like faces. The violent sequences, however, are creative, given the fact it is appropriately aimed at younger teenagers. Gore is obscured with clever shadows, impacts are reasonably cut at the last second to not only censor, but also to keep it from appearing cheesy. When it does not remember to cut at the right time, the result is usually very silly; which could possibly be the point when regarding its 1980s theme.""Five Nights at Freddy's,"" almost seems purposeful in its lack of creepiness as tonal inconsistencies emerge as an enormous problem. About halfway in, the film turns from a slightly unsettling adventure into a tone reminiscent of a bubbly montage found in many Chuck-e-Cheese home videos. It's inorganic, and any suggestion of a spine-chilling blockbuster evaporates at this point. It almost suggests that multiple drafts of the film were sloppily merged together. It attempts to tread back to perilous moments later on, but interest in the unfinished plot is alarmingly small by the time it gets there.With all of that said, ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" is better than any movie about a point-and-click game has any right to be. It is simply bothersome that it could have been drastically more enjoyable had the plot added more depth and the atmosphere remain similar to its source material. It is about guaranteed that the film will receive an endless supply of sequels, with a spark of hope that it only goes up from here. This first entry, however, does not make a good impression for the franchise going forward. If the screenwriter were to be changed for a more experienced one, improvements could be of large proportions.Five Nights at Freddy's - 56/100""Five Nights at Freddy's"" may have the fantasy going for it, but the removal of scares and fun prevent it from truly coming to life.",2023-11-02
I watch this show make me goosebumps and chilling it so awesome creepy and awesome my favorite play game this show awesome.

Will phase FNAF 2 movie remake I'm so excited please keep going make FNAF more phases marking movie love it!,2023-10-28
Pooooo man this is one of the worst adaptations of a game I've ever seen! I lived through the OG Mario Bros film and this was waaaaay worse then that! This is just soooo boring and soul sucking. Especially if you played the games! You will not like this. I already had a feeling the cop girl was like an owner or new one of the kids and it ends up the guy that hired him in the beginning was the one who was killing all the kids and putting them in the suits for their souls or whatever. Which I kid of figured most that out. The acting in this from the main characters is bad. It's just not on par with what I thought the film should have beeen compared to the game. NOT ONE SINGLE JUMP SCARE! This movie was lame asf no cap.,2023-10-30
"I was so exsited for this movie as a huge fan of the games and a devout member of the fandom, when the first news of the movie came out claiming it would be a 3 hour long R rated movie I was ecstatic, only to later find out it was an hour 50 and pg13. Still I went into it with hope, and when I saw news of the first to watch it hating it I excused it, many people aren't fans of the games so maybe they just didn't know enough about them to thoroughly enjoy it as I hopped I would. Went in exsited, found myself wishing the movie would just end not even half way through, a major disappointment, the film had no atmosphere, the gore was non existent, the horror franchise I grew up on was adapted into a movie I would more describe a comedy, no scares what so ever, I predicted every single twist and reveal, I even predicted the lines the characters would say before they even said it. I grew up imagining getting springlocked as a horrific brutal and gory endeavour only to find it so tame and bland i nearly walked out of the theatre, the actors did a fine job but nothing outstanding, I wish Matthew lilard went full stu maucher with the ""I always come back"" line. I found the story to be the most boring strung together peice of work, to the point I was thinking of ways I would have changed the movie to make it better and found not one element of this ""movie"" to make the cut, so disappointed im genuinely sad as I hoped this would be a fantastic film full of fun jumpscares and gore, only to stumble upon the worst film of the year, possibly even the worst film I've seen that's come out since I was born, not to be dramatic, I was just so let down. I do really hope the fnaf franchise gets another movie that hopefully does it right, as the kids raised on the movie have grown up, they want to see a horror film for them now, not as a gateway horror for the younger kids who may have not even been born when the games came out. We want wall to wall jump scares, brutal gore, scary ambiance, and swearing, no one says ""what the heck"", at least no one respectable. As a huge fan of the franchise I really hope for another movie that may do it better, to mr. Blum ik it may be way more exspensive to do it the way fans want it, but it will pay off in the long run.",2023-11-01
"(Coming from a huge fan of the games) FNAF is a horror game with a very disturbing backstory. The pixelated moment with springtrap in game was a lot scarier than the live action scene, how is that even possible? It felt like a kids movie. Very very disappointing as I have been waiting for a FNAF movie for sooo many years now. After the movie ended, everyone at the cinema just left quietly with no applause, screams of excitement or even a happy face even tho there were a lot of fans. They just made a cliche horror movie with the animatronics: little kid drawing, talking to imaginary friends and nobody believes her etc. The movie was about some family drama not about surviving the night. The security guard was pretty much in no danger and he was sleeping all the nights and dreaming about the kids. There were not even any doors that he would have had to close if they get too close. It was literally a night guard duty job with nothing happening other than bad dreams... Later on he brought his sister there as there was literally no threat there and she wanted to go. There was even a scene where the animatronics were building a chair fort together and being best friends... I had no idea FNAF could be so unscary even tho the animatronics were very well done. In the very end they became dangerous to them but you really couldnt care less if anyone died and the animatronics just werent even a bit scary anymore. They also tried to put some lame jokes around for no reason. Knowing how disturbing, scary and unique the original games are im just wondering why they decided to make it a cliche ""horror"" movie that has been done a million times already. Nothing made sense. They could have made such an awesome movie with the concept of the games like having the guard trying to piece together whats happening, checking the cameras, having to save power and actually surviving... They could have had some scary flashbacks as he is figuring out what happened and showing the horror that the kids witnessed and went through and getting more insane knowing he might suffer the same fate. Could have been such a terrifying horror movie perfect for halloween and for fans but nah... I am extremely sad to leave such a review but its just the truth.",2023-10-28
"Honestly I wasn't sure I was going to review this movie but since I have a lot to say I thought might as well.Firstly I want to give my praise for the amazing practical effects from Jim Henson's creature shop. They really do look incredible, and it's awesome to see the animatronics moving around.Secondly I want to praise the direction, Emma Tammi seems like she knows what she is doing, the movie has a distinct look which I enjoyed.And lastly for praise I want to say Josh Hutcherson really gives it his all, he really carried what otherwise might have been a really boring protagonist. I actually really like what they did with his character. I really enjoyed the dream theory thing, and actually found it very interesting.Now to the negatives:Firstly the script itself, it's a mess. I feel like there was definitely a better script a few rewrites away, but alas this is what they went with. There are way too many plot points, and the movie feels unsure of what it wants to be. More time should have been spent fleshing out characters such as Afton, Abby and Vanessa. Characters like the aunt and her thugs could have been completely removed from the movie, their screentime could have been used on the other more important characters.Speaking of Vanessa, boy is she a badly written character, if you can even call her that. She exists to drop information. More time needed to be used on her to explain who she is. She also acts very inconsistently with one moment being happy and then in the next threatening to shoot someone.Next up is William Afton, such a waste of Matthew Lillard. He barely has a presence in the movie despite being the main antagonist. He needed more screentime so his entrance in the final confrontation isn't so random. In turn fleshing him out could also help give us more of Vanessa's backstory. Perhaps we could see her childhood and how William's treatment shaped her.Next up is the lack of horror. The movie isn't scary, and when I say that I mean like at all. I remember in one of the promotional videos Lillard said this would be full of jumpscares, yet I can only recall one. And it didn't even land since you saw it coming a mile a way. Also the lack of a creepy atmosphere really brings the movie down. The animatronics aren't allowed to act creepy, and most of their screentime is either spent in the middle of the film befriending Abby. I was also disappointed we didn't see a single scene of Mike just trying to survive the night like in the games.The final confrontation is rushed. Afton literally just appears out nowhere to taunt Mike. And then gets swiftly killed after Abby replaces a drawing of him with the kids with one where he is killing them.Honestly I hope they work to make the script more tight if a sequel is made, overall I don't hate this movie. And I actually quite enjoyed it despite all my problems with it. I'd give this movie a 6.5/10.",2023-10-29
"My kids have been begging to watch their first horror film and I haven't been able to allow it cause they're all awkwardly sexual. Finally a film that has a story line that makes sense, and isn't full of innapropriate romance scenes.The story line itself is pretty good, and the jump scares are enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. The acting is on parr and i think they just did a really good job. My kids who love the fnaf game said there were so many good nods to the games, and were excited to watch it. All in all, a pretty good movie and a good movie for your first horror film if you're a kid.",2023-10-28
"As always, we have your typical dynamics that we see frequently in movies. When it is a male main character and a female one that has the answers.. she will refuse to give the guy the answeres that would make the guy's life much easier.. had blondie there just old him what was happening, Mike could have done something about it..
but of course, had the main character been a female and police officer a male, she would have gotten on his face and made him tell her the truth.The scene when mike wakes up and the police officer lady bandaged his arm.. so, the big toy cornered him at the locked door but he got away somehow? Ok, he asks her about the babysitter and the brother and she already knew they were gone.. she never told him anything about them being possessed.. dude, what kind of cop is this chick anyway.. it was the second time he asked her.. and she just babbled something and never answered...her explaining about the kids... we all know that if it were the other way around as in the male officer having kept everything from the woman and his father being the killer.. we know she would have sucker punched real good.. right?The dude from the job office being the bad guy.. it was obvious from the start since he was the only other character introduced besides the already dead ones..so in the end.. the animatronics were possessed or the kids were actually inside physically? I didnt understand and didnt make any sense.. all of this drama o mike not remembering.. only for it to be ignored.. his brother is gone and the soul.. who knows.. i thought there would be a twist .. maybe his brother was in one of the things.. but nah.. so this arc was just nonsense to make him look like he spent the night drinking.",2023-10-29
"This movie is absolutely horrible in every way. There is not a single redeeming quality. The writing is poor, the acting is mediocre, and it is not scary at all. It seems like the only positive reviews are coming from prior fans of the game series who hold a bias, but for the average viewer who's just wanting to watch a good film this is a fail. The pacing in the movie is very jarring, and there is also far too much dialogue and not enough action. The plot is a convoluted mess and the final showdown was a huge let down. The run time of the film is rather long yet it still wasn't able to make any sense of the story. Completely forgettable and generic.",2023-10-27
"I don't have a lot to say other than that I haven't seen a video game adaptation this bad since Paul W. S Anderson's Resident Evil series. I don't really want to fill this entire review bubble up but I would HIGHLY suggest avoiding the theater for this one, it's a mess and a big one at that. It has way too many plot holes and pacing problems that it's unbearable to sit through- the acting from Hutcherson and Lillard is good, but I cannot say the same for the rest of the cast whatsoever.Incredibly underwhelming and worst of all: not scary, whatsoever. This film's tone was back and fourth and I couldn't believe what I was watching for nearly forty minutes.As far as adaptations go, it's bad, and I mean really bad. It's own story felt completely rewritten by Hollywood executives and not Scott himself, and it's just disappointing to such an extent that it's hard to imagine Scott even had a hand in any of this whatsoever because I couldn't imagine him being ok with the final results.Of course there's the PG-13 issue but this is something I somewhat anticipated (the games were never hyper violent nor gory, just dark material as far as storyline goes) but it's held back so much by dropping the violence in favor of weak jumpscares- it's disappointing to say the least.I dunno guys, I couldn't recommend spending nearly $12 to go and see this in the theaters- luckily we caught this on Peacock but it's really not worth admission for what you're expecting. Is it cool seeing the animatronics? Absolutely. Is it frightening and dark like the games were? Nope. Is the story just like the games? Nope.Look, take it as you will but it's just not worth your money. It's disappointing and I think the best part out of it all was Corey and that's all I could gather from it.",2023-10-27
"Either the original games' atmosphere and story were way worse than I remember them being, or this movie just did a really poor job replicating them. The animatronics themselves just aren't scary and constantly get demystified over the course of this movie, leaving only very few moments where there's actually a hint of horror left. The story, while not entirely uninteresting, still seems convoluted and only holds the movie back even more when it comes to actually being scary or creating a chilling atmosphere. This seems to me like a fine hommage to the original games, which you'll probably find some way to enjoy if you're already a fan of the series. For everyone else though, it's neither that interesting, nor scary. There aren't any interesting stylistic devices present and most moments are either completely forgettable or immediately obvious.Overall I'd give it a watch if you're somewhat interested in the franchise. It's not unwatchable, Just really generic.",2023-11-01
"Where should I start?Firstly, what mainly characterizes the FNAF franchise, besides it's character design, is it's lore. It's complicated subplots and secondary character storylines that end up connecting to each other. All of which were absolutely ignored and vagely resembled the original source.Do you want to make a whole new thing, inspired by the games? That's alright (though I believe it's a huge missed opportunity), but we can work with that.However, the problem is, this movie does NOT stand by itsfelf. It has absolutely no idea what it wants to be.It starts as a drama, then turns into poorly animated gore, then suddenly it's a lazily written sitcom. This movie jumps into genres like it was Super Mario, and none of them really seems to fit.The plot is an atrocity. Spends 1/3 of screen time on a bunch of side villains that barely have anything to do with the main story. Until the script itself realizes it's a waste of time and gets rid of them.I could go on for a while, but it's not worth it. It's so bad it could be considered unintentional comedy.",2023-11-02
"Overall, a lazy story focused on keeping the animatronics offscreen unless completely necessary, the saving grace is the animatronics when they appear.Maybe budget? Maybe trying to build a deeper story but I got so tired of the kidnapped brother storyline, I get how it's important but did not need to take up that much time with it. It felt like a cop-out for production not having enough money to have the characters in more scenes. The constant flashbacks to the same scene ruined it for me.That said, the animatronics were incredible, just scarce throughout the movie, and not in a ""keeping the scary stuff unseen"" way. I like the characters, but especially the cop's story fell apart at the end. She can't be good and not tell them what's going on.Overall, a lazy story focused on keeping the animatronics offscreen unless completely necessary, the saving grace is the animatronics when they appear.",2023-11-01
"I saw this movie without any ""relationship"" to games or any bond to the YouTube hype. And this movie is pretty bad - even for B horror movie. Effects are fine - but these days even the lowest budget movies have fine effects.So what is left? Well the background story is kinda ok and the acting is also kinda believable.Where I think it goes wrong is when it tries to explain things with science and everyone just accepts obviously wrong assumptions about electricity and mechanics. Why not just embrace the supernatural and let that be the explanation for most things.The big brother is just stupid - I am tired of self-destructive no-good characters. It is just very hard to be sympathetic and be on his side when he keeps making so poor choices. And trauma or mental sickness does explain the choices.This is not scary at all, just kinda weird and frustrating to watch.",2023-10-29
"This movie sucks on every level except visually. I've been a Fnaf fan since day one when I was only 14, now I'm 23 and I waited years. I knew I was going to be disappointed but this movie doesn't work on any level. As a stand-alone movie it's just plain bad and as a fan of the games I'm severely disappointed and disgusted with Scott's desire to ruin his own franchise with references to anything but the matpat m-preg story he wrote. If you think the story went down hill after pizzeria simulator you won't like this movie. Some people say this movie is for the fans but my friend and I were so beyond upset after leaving the theater because if this is what fans like I severely worry about their judgement in other parts of life if they can rave over a lack of story, 8 plots that go nowhere and a complete betrayal to everything the first games were.",2023-10-27
"Five Nights at Freddy's is a great concept. A person is provided a job as a security guard at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza and things become weirder each night. That sounds like a great horror movie. It's a shame this isn't remotely it.The movie is an actual slog fest that is more focused on adapting the lore, rather than being a competent horror movie. The games are notable for their jump scares and this movie only had 2 which is mind-boggling. I dislike horror movies that are reliant on jump scares but this movie would have actually benefitted if it had more because it was so boring. This movie not being scary at all, is my biggest disappointment. The plot is stupid, the characters are uninteresting, and a lot of the scenes are incredibly goofy (that fort-building scene sticks in my mind).Still, the animatronics look terrific and the set design feels like it was pulled right from the games. It is also filled with easter eggs that fans will love. The sound design is also great and can be quite unsettling. I can see fans liking this movie. However, a YouTube video talking about FNAF lore is more interesting than this.",2023-10-28
"This movie lived up to the hype and it was better than expected. Every fan will love it. This was worth waiting 8 years to be honest with you guys. I loved the movie, the comedy and horror were well mixed and that ending was amazing. The whole movie was just great and you all should watch it in theaters as this is the perfect movie for Halloween this season. It will definitely become another horror classic. The Animatronics were perfect just as the cast was. Everyone fit the role perfectly and brought the heart to the movie, the set design was also greatly done. The music fit every scene and was perfectly done
10/10 will watch it again.",2023-10-25
"This movie was absolutely incredible. It follows the storyline to the original game almost exactly, and the acting is phenomenal! I really liked the work they put into this film, and including a lot of background scenes about Mike. Jump-scares are incredibly done, and the animatronics are terrifying! The overall plot of the movie was well maintained, and had me on the edge of my seat for the whole length of the film. Very little CGI was used, really bringing the animatronics to life. For diehard fans of the original game released back in 2014, the movie set, from my observations, was exact! Fantastic film overall, 10 stars!",2023-10-27
"I walked in the theatre thinking this movie was going to be a 2 hour replica of the first game. How wrong I was. I really wanted more footage of the security guard ""surviving"". He spent like three nights there...dreaming about his brother. I wanted Freddy to show up at the door with the theme song and him like freak out like everyone did when they would play a fnaf game. I understand the directors needing to place the base layer of info for people who haven't played the game, but it was incredibly slow. Also, there was maybe 1 halfway decent jumpscare! I think every fan wanted a handful of scares just like the games. One thing I did like was the animatronics. They seemed to behave properly like the game, but that was 1 pro and way too many cons. I hope when and if they try to make a sequel, they will change it drastically.",2023-10-28
"Mike Schmidt (Josh Hutcherson) is a troubled man still dealing with the trauma of having witnessed his brother abducted at a young age and is now struggling to serve as guardian to his younger sister Abby (Piper Rubio) who is often aloof and lost in fantasy. After losing yet another job due to an outburst of his psychosis, career counselor Steve Raglan (Matthew Lillard) offers Mike a job working nights at the closed down family entertainment center Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. As Mike takes the position routinely sleeping and revisiting his recurring dreams of memories of his younger brother's abduction, strange occurrences appear to be happening in his new job that infiltrate his dreams.Five Nights at Freddy's is the long awaited film adaptation of the video game series of the same name created in 2014. With the initial video games becoming quite popular, development on a film began not long after their release with Warner Bros. Acquiring the rights in 2015 only for it to linger in development hell with a revolving door of creative teams and companies attached at various points. Eventually the film gained traction at Universal and Blumhouse in 2021 in spite of similar films like 2019's The Banana Splits Movie or 2021's Willy's Wonderland beating this film to release and trying to ride the franchise's coattails. After an 8 year journey to the screen, Five Nights at Freddy's looks nice but just doesn't have a compelling story or characters that made it seem all that special.To start off on a positive note, Five Nights at Freddy's is a very handsome production and considering it had more resources than Willy's Wonderland or The Banana Splits Movie it certainly can be seen on screen. The animatronics were made by Jim Henson's Creature Shop and manage to avoid looking like guys in suits and actually do feel like clunky heavy animatronics you'd seen in an 80s children's play place. However despite looking the part, Five Nights at Freddy's never felt all that scary and it didn't feel like there was much of a payoff. It's really not the film's fault that some of the novelty has worn off by being beaten to the punch by imitators, but even being imitators those films offered more in terms of memorability like the over the top gore in Banana Splits or Nicolas Cage's mute action hero performance in Willy's Wonderland gave those films that extra something to make them stand out. While Josh Hutcherson is clearly giving his all to the performance, Mike just isn't that interesting as a protagonist and my mind just went to other films that did this concept better some of which came from Blumhouse themselves. M3GAN from earlier this year had a stronger fractured family dynamic and more energy to the horror and entertainment value, and last year's The Black Phone did the concept of a serial child abductor and the victims' ghosts much more intensely. I was very much reminded of that William Brent Bell movie Separation from a few year's ago where it was mostly very stock (with the exception of one or two decent elements) and that's unfortunately where I fell on Five Nights at Freddy's.Five Nights at Freddy's might please diehard fans of this franchise with its attention to detail and plethora of easter eggs, but for me personally I felt underwhelmed beyond the animatronics and production design and I'd welcome a Banana Splits or Willy's Wonderland sequel before wanting one for this one (which they imply with no subtlety is happening).",2023-10-28
"My oldest son is 10 & has been obsessed with FNAF since he was 5. He has been so excited to see this movie & as parents we were hoping it wouldn't be too gory. This was just the right amount of scary that he didn't want to walk to his room alone, but not enough he didn't need to sleep in my bed afterwards. That's a good level of scare, just enough he enjoyed it, not so much he couldn't watch it.It also was entertaining enough we were able to watch it as a family. Matthew Lillard for the parents, Josh Hutchinson for the kids.Visually the movie was flawless. & All your favorite bits were in the movie! We got to watch this the day before it came out on theaters due to streaming it on Peacock which was also really nice.Overall the entire family was impressed & hoping for a sequel that's just as good!",2023-10-27
"This movie has all the feelings of a great idea but with no conviction. As a horror movie it sucks big style and as a comedy it isn't much better. The actors act like they just want a pay check. There are some ""scary scenes"" but they just aren't scary, they are predictable. You will not be jumping out of your seat to this film. I want to say something good about it but there is just so little. The whole movie just has an air of cheap new actors and old has beens. It is also way too long for a movie of this appallingness. 88 to 91 minutes would have sufficed but they made it 110 minutes for no obvious reason. Just an extra 20 minutes for the poor punter to endure. My advice is to just not bother....you will thank me for it in the long run.",2023-10-25
"This movie is lame as hell. Super slow and boring. No gore. No nudity. A few weak jump scares that you can see coming from a mile away. The acting is terrible. Two hour long movie felt like five hours. The story is unbelievably cringe. The robots look cool but they don't really do anything other than standing around. If you have a child or a newborn infant then I would recommend taking them to see this lukewarm, fake horror movie but don't expect to be scared or even feel anything at all. The aunt is a hideous hag that barely looks human. The son is a demented little weirdo that never stops whining. The only good actor is the guy who plays the pharmacist. He nailed his lines. Anyone who is scared of this film is most likely faking it just like that idiot did with the game to get views on YouTube. Save your money and buy a hamburger or a hotdog instead. This is an abomination.",2023-10-28
"I remember watching a FNAF rip-off movie with Nicolas Cage called Willy's Wonderland, and that movie was terrible but somehow the animatronics on that movie have 10 times more things to do than the FNAF animatronics itself in their own movie, i hate everything in this movie, the only time i feel like the movie has potential was only in the first 5 minutes of the film and that's including the opening credit, FNAF the movie could be at least decent if it's literally like the game, a 90 minutes fun ride in a abandoned kids place, instead we get this boring ass uninteresting backstory of our main character and it's really not working for me at all, and the worst thing is they spend way more time on the main character story than the scary FNAF related stuff, i also wasn't scared for once, the jumpscare are the most predictable and the cheapest jumpscare i've ever experienced, it have some of if not the worst movie editing i've ever watch, the way they cut one scene to another was just terrible and mostly annoying, they also really going hard with the PG-13 rating in this movie so everything related to violence looks absolutely stupid, the performance was meh, sometimes it's cringe, and overall a super boring horror movie, Five Nights At Freddy's was stupid, it is bored to hell, nothing scary, nothing impressive except maybe all the animatronics accurate design, but in terms of story it is one of the worst story to ever adapted from a game, they literally have the easiest concept yet also accurate to the original game instead they wanted to have more story, more drama which will work if the story was interesting, well in this case it was an awfully, dull, and boring story that they expand and it's fail, it's super disappointing even from a guy that was not a FNAF super fan, Five Nights At Freddy's was simply the worst movie of the year so far, and also one of the worst movie i've ever seen.",2023-10-27
"The only ""good"" part were the end credits. And it's because of the living tombstone's song.If that doesn't tell you about the quality of this movie, I don't know what will.My review has to have 500 more characters to post, so I'll just go ahead and break it down for you I guess. In the least spoiler-y way possible.Whoever made this movie has no idea how to make a horror movie. Who is your audience? Children? Adults? It's not at all clear who this was aimed for and that's probably the biggest reason it fell flat.Had it been a gory horror movie, maybe it would've been better. But since there are several scenes in the movie where it seems to be pandering to little kids, it feels like the whole movie is a big identity crisis.Also the writing just sucks.Allow me to clarify (I edited this in since I had some time to think about it later and talk to other people about it). A major character died. No funeral, no police investigation. The body wasn't hidden it was in a house, the MAIN CHARACTER'S house. Yet? No mention of it after? Just nothing, like it never happened.On top of that, a major plot point is about the main character's brother. We find out who did it, but it was NEVER elaborated on. WHAT happened to him. WHY did it happen. WHERE is his body. Just nothing at all. It's like the writers forgot that was the literal main plot of their story. (It would have made much more sense to make the brother like... one of the animatronics... no idea why they didn't just do that. EASY solution to all of those questions.)Then there's a scene where the cop is asking the main character about why he didn't lock a door. Instead of him saying ""I did lock the door"" or ""I'm sorry I forgot to lock the door"" he instead replies ""YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND"". Wha? Huh? Then he walks the cop to a little creek, sits down, and goes on a giant boring exposition about his brother. HOW is this related to locking a door.You wasted 10+ minutes of screen time retelling something we were shown at least 5 times by then, but had no clear response to the question he had been asked. So when you look at the WHOLE situation, the conversation went like this:""why didn't you lock the door"" ""you don't understand, my brother is dead and here's how that happened"". DID YOU LOCK THE DOOR OR DID YOU NOT? THIS ANSWERS NOTHING.On top of all of this, no police investigation into the missing victims that are shown on screen dying. No mention of them after. Everything just resumes as normal.WHY did Afton want the main character to work at the pizza place as a night guard after finding out he was the brother of the kid? WHY didn't the girl straight up tell the main character about her dad and instead ""hinted at it"". WHY did she have to hint. It's not like he was watching her. Nobody was. She could have just straight up said it.By the way, she was supposed to be on duty, yet she stayed there the whole night with the main character. What about the rest of her route? Makes NO sense. How did she explain it to her coworkers when she was MIA for so long.WHEN THE TAPE MESSES UP, WHY DID THE MAIN CHARACTER HIT THE TV? INSTEAD OF THE VHS PLAYER? Hitting the TV will do nothing to effect the tape messing up, come on guys.WHY didn't the animatronics whip around quickly, like they did in the games? Why were they so slow the entire movie? All of the jump scares fell so flat because everything was too well lit and the animatronics moved too slow. Whats the point of a flashlight when everything's so well lit nobody even bothers to turn on a light to see.Why are they scared of the Balloon Boy doll? You have to have CONTEXT for him to be scary. My mom, who barely knows about the FNAF series, watched the movie on her own and was completely baffled by why there were jump scares with the doll. It just. Looks like a doll. You have to know WHY it's scary for it to BE scary.It's just not a movie made for anyone. Too bloody to be for kids, too boring for teens, too kiddish for adults. There are so many things in this movie that DON'T MAKE SENSE.They don't even do a good job convincing you that he's poor, because there are government programs for people who need help with child care. Yet he is never shown reaching out about it and decides to just take his sister to work with him.He also acts like the animatronics being alive is. Normal. He isnt freaking out about it. No reaction just. Huh? Oh. This is normal.How did he know the kids were the ones from his dreams. Why did he just decide they were ghosts in his dream instead of just a dream. He looks at them and is just ""OH! You're the missing kids!"". What?So people that are mad about people rating this movie poorly, understand that you can enjoy things and they can be fun, but that doesn't mean they can't be critiqued by people who expected the movie, that was inspired by a game, to be more like the game.I wish I could give it a higher score for the puppets and for Matthew being in the movie, but there were no many negatives that it cancels out the positives.That's my honest review. I'm not a ""hater"" I'm not someone who never played the games. I'm a person who likes horror and likes good horror media, and this was not that.Thanks for reading.",2023-10-28
"I've never been that crazy of five nights at Freddy's . But I know some kids and high school students talk about it. My young cousin who lives in Florida is a crazy fan of five nights at Freddy's . After seeing this movie tonight I say it was really awesome and crazy wild with loads of fans kids , teenagers , and young adults like myself. The story was so incredible and very wild and it did have some intense moments where one is the people got cut in half by Freddy fuzzbear, foxy really had a way with stocking her victims , chica really knows how to find ways of winning a fight . The rest of the characters from five nights at Freddy's were really awesome , scary and uh very intense robots . William who was dressed as the yellow bunny was so crazy . I hope they do a directors cut where they're more scenes and hopefully and alternate ending .",2023-10-27
"They change the entire plot of the games and did way too much in such a short amount of time. They combined the pizza complex with the Pizzeria from the first game lore and it didn't make any sense at all. Vanessa is now a cop and purple guy daughter. When she was just some unlucky Employee that got Possess by glitch trap. As someone who grew up with the games and watched everyone timeline videos about the lore, it just a shame that they weren't more Faithful to the games that we grow up playing. Glad we got to see matpat and Corey but we really need mark to be i
this movie too. Watch it for yourself and make your own opinion.",2023-10-29
"I'm gonna be honest, video game movies have been getting better in recent years. And I thought they were gonna get progressively better than they were in early ears in video game adapted movies. But I guess not all of them can be good. Five Nights at Freddy's is just another soulless video game adaptation that only wants to make this movie cash out the games. While it may have some good visuals that stay true to the games with the animatronics and the details on the pizzeria, the movie would provide a plot that relies on just Mike and his arc about his family issues ti the point of becoming predictable. I'll give the movie for trying, but the story around the pizzeria doesn't happen until the third act. Also, the movie is not as scary as you may think. In fact, the movie barely has any scary moments. Most we would get is just characters playing around the pizzeria and the animatronics interacting the one character, but not in a thrilling way. And not to mention with how the characters have been handled. Mike being the punching bag and Abby's interactions to the animatronics. And they're connection don't really affect much. I think the best recommendation is this will be for the die hard FNAF fans. After all, they have been asking for many years if there would be an actual FNAF movie, and here we are. You'll probably enjoy it. Outside of that, I don't think it would be worth a watch. It would be better to play the games instead. Actually, I even recommend the fan SFM videos on YouTube. At least some of them can have enjoyable storytelling. As for the actual movie, the only thing we would get is just disappointing and easily dull. I guess I'll just wait for Sonic The Hedgehog 3 next year. Happy Halloween.",2023-10-30
"I want to preface this review by saying that I am someone who came into this solely to watch the movie. I never played the game and know very little about the characters/storyline.I came into it with a very basic understanding - a man owning a pizzeria uses it as a guise to kidnap and murder children, and then somehow trapping their souls in the animatronics.Knowing what I knew, I was intrigued when I heard a movie about it would be coming out. I was interested in seeing how they would make that come to life.That being said, right off the bat, I was disappointed with how little gore/scares there were. The majority of ""violence"" happened off screen. This movie is classified as horror. Not a single moment made me jump or feel scared.The movie was both short but also felt like long stretches of nothing was happening.**SPOILERS** Now this might come from my lack of knowing about the lore, but my biggest gripe was Vanessa. So a cop knows her dad is going around murdering people? And she tried ""warning"" Mike by doing next to nothing. Again, maybe this might be better explained from fans of the story, but her whole character was just riddled with problems.I kinda wish this movie went into a little more depth. Everything felt very surface level. Nothing is really explained too well. I wish there more background/screen time on William.Overall, it was a somewhat enjoyable watch. It's definitely a movie you can't take too seriously. By the looks of the ending, it looks like they'll be another. Hopefully the next one will step up it's game.",2023-10-27
"As a fan of fnaf, I didn't mind that the movie kinda broke out of the lore. But it wasn't a great movie. The writing felt lazy, the characters were just fine, there wasn't a whole lot of tension. The whole thing just felt fine, which is weird to me because the cast was great and the animatronic suits were really impressive. The sound design was kinda bad in my opinion, but something that I actually really liked was the lighting. The scenes felt super empty and lifeless, like the places around them weren't real, and even in scenes with extras it felt dull. The movie just fell flat. I'm genuinely happy that so many people enjoyed it, but I feel like you can make a movie that's a love letter to a series and still a good movie on its own.",2023-10-30
"By far the best movie of the year!!! For a fan of the games like me, this was exactly what I have been waiting for. Jim Hensons Creature Shop and Blumhouse under the watchful eye of the amazing Scott Cawthon made a visually stunning and compelling movie that now made cannon so many speculations that fans have been dying for! The theatre was electrified the entire time and it was like playing the games or watching your favorite YouTuber play it but on a big screen. Truly Fantastic! Freddy proves that the best stuff will ""Always Come Back!"" Thank you to the developers for making this! Absolutely incredible!",2023-10-27
"I have been a massive fan of the games watching every theroy i could get my hands on for the last 9 years
and i was really excited to finally get some things answered
this movie does answer some things but it really doesn't if you're a fan of the games you kinda already expect the story to go exactly when it does and it falls so flat on its delivery of ground breaking plot reveals this movie thinks it has
they ruined the animatronics they had them building forts and laying down under the stars with our main characters
the acting is piss poor ngl
all and all i went to see this with my girlfriend and she hasn't ever played the game but she was so bored we kept waiting and waiting for it to get good and it never did near the last 15 mins they gave us a bit of fan service and things fans of the games will be happy baout but like i said it fails to really hit home on its reveals and ""wow"" moments in my cinema people clapped and it made me very mad that movie didn't deserve the claps it was getting
i walked out of the cinema legitimately depressed i was so disappointed we waited 9 years for this movie and it failed to deliver on everything the only thing they got spot on was the visuals the setting and everything looked incredible but this movie it falls flat on everything else no matter if you're a die hard fan like me or a causal movie goer like my girlfriend
skip this one trust me
it's just a huge disappointment and you will walk out disappointed skip this one.",2023-10-29
"Hmm, so this DIDN'T turn out to be the Halloween gift I was anticipating. I've played the first FNAF game on my PC back in 2014, and the only thing the film gets right are the animatronic designs. I can picture the director's passion in wanting to stay true to the game's lore, but as a horror film, Emma Tammi utterly fails to deliver the goods. The film sets up a backstory for its protagonist played by Josh Hutcherson, but the pizzeria and its fascinating inhabitants barely get anything substantial.The tone is all over the place, and the film just doesn't let anything circumstantially funny be treated as funny. I think the makers went down the wrong path when they decided NOT to make this into a horror-comedy, which it well and truly could've been. The animatronics don't startle at all, and even for someone who hasn't played any of the videogames, this will come across as tame and lacking in thrills.Hutcherson puts up an okay show, but I absolutely did not enjoy Elizabeth Lail's performance (or characterization). You could literally call her ""Exposition Dump"" and it'd make no difference. Matthew Lillard is sort of there too, but what's even the point? I'm guessing the PG-13 rating is in line with what the original games wanted to offer: less gore, more atmospheric. Here, they achieve neither. And that's certainly a knock on the game's creator Scott Cawthon, who's part of the writing team here. There are too many scenes where violence is implied, but never shown. Ugh, bummer!",2023-10-27
"Why does it look so much like another fnaf fanfiction? In these phrases there is nothing recognizable from the original series, except perhaps the animatronics themselves, as if this film is trying hard to seem like canon, but it's not him. And judging by the introduction, I can already say that this film will be a weak thriller of category B for the young target audience of fnaf, BRAVO SCOTT!!It was once a horror, but it became a children's entertainment, because it is more profitable to work for a children's audience...The ending where Steve Raglan (William Afton) dies from spring locks in a springbonnie suit is literally taken from Scott Cawton's 2017 book silver eyes, but unlike the book version, where the suit slams shut because he was pushed away by the main protagonist Charlie, whom he took hostage, then in the film spring locks are triggered from for the fact that an animatronic cupcake jumps on Springbonnie, biting off part of the belly of the suit and touching these springs...... What a cringe......The villain himself, William Afton, did not seem interesting to me from the word at all, an ordinary sadist. For the children's audience for which this film is designed, it may work, but as a character it is empty and simplified.The costumes, especially the Springbonnie costume, look worse than many fan cosplay costumes. I mean, William Afton's suit looks bulky, carelessly made, as if the designers did not even try to make a nice costume design, and the material from which it is made looks like some kind of sponge.The pizzeria itself, especially the office, has absolutely no atmosphere of the first part, and looks cardboard. In fact, everything in this movie looks hastily done. As if the creators abandoned this project for years and after a long time decided to make a film with the most simplified story and collect money from the youngest audience.I'm not waiting for a sequel or prequel, because as a true fan of the series, I don't want to suffer seeing how fnaf buries itself deeper into the grave. Not that I expected some very atmospheric and dark thriller with a very charismatic film adaptation of William Afton, but in my opinion it turned out to be the worst option.",2023-10-28

The story takes inspiration from many famous moments from the series and introduces new and inspired takes on characters we have loved for years.Jim Henson's Creature Shop has done a brilliant job bringing Freddy, Bonnie, Chica and Foxy to life and the actors all gave brilliant performances.The movie contains many little secrets that will be sure to bring smiles to the faces of long-time fans whilst being an easy introduction to the series for newcomers.10/10, would highly recommend.",2023-10-27
"I was excited to watch this movie after so much hype was built. I haven't played the game so i don't know how good the story has been adapted.For me, the movie was dull and lazy. The story and the script felt half baked and it felt that the story had more potential to have more thriller and horror elements. The screenplay was also uneven, the direction was average and the performances were above average. The suspense and the thrill were missing from the movie and it feels like a bland story from which you were expecting too much.Overall, I won't say that the movie was bad but it was neither good. It had it's moments and Irate it as an average.",2023-10-27

But the storytelling is absolutely amazing in this film. My favorite looking animatronic has to be Foxy, he just looks so amazingly done. Bonnie is a close second. Seriously though if you want a good horror movie to watch with your friends, this is the one for fans and non fans alike. I loved this movie, even if the critic reviews are negative, Scott made this movie with care. And he is what truly carried this movie in its entirety!",2023-10-25
"I love the FNAF games, and was so excited when I learned they would be creating a movie for the game franchise.The animatronics look very accurate and feel a bit unsettling, but sometimes they felt a bit goofy, in the games they are not like that so it felt a bit strange seeing them fort scene. Sort of split between whether or not I find this addition to be good, because on one side I prefer it when adaptations happen to not twist the original source material too much, but on the other side it helped emphasize the fact that there are children inhabiting the animatronics and they are easily influenced (thus why they would help William Afton perhaps?).The set also looked lovely, the sound and all of that was nice, I feel though that the story was a bit rushed. Overall the games and the movie don't go hand in hand plot-wise which can feel frustrating and confusing to fans of FNAF.The last problem I had is that, even though this is a horror movie it felt way too silly and funny. I feel like for a movie like FNAF they should have used a lot more jumpscares similar to the game. I did not feel scared at any point of the movie. Lastly, while I love Steve Raglan, that last line... just was not it. It felt so unserious and that whole scene could have been handled in a better way.",2023-10-29
"Five Nights at Freddy's has a very clear love for the source material however that isn't enough to make up for an adaptation that's light on scares and too heavy on lore. It's pretty funny and really weird but it's also almost entirely free of any terror or tension, constantly undermining itself and over-explaining everything to the point nothing makes sense.Possibly even more of a crime than any of that though, is the fact that it's just really boring, diverting almost all of its screen time to the wrong aspects. It's a serious contender for the least scary horror film of all time. Being gore free doesn't help either, it's hard to be scared of the animatronics when you can't actually see what they're doing to people.Josh Hutcherson ironically spends most of the film sleeping, his bored attitude does occasionally work in its favour until anything major happens, then he just feels too restrained. Matthew Lillard clearly understands the assignment and the only issue is he's not in the film anywhere near enough.Emma Tammi's direction has a fair few frustrating missed opportunities, even if the practical effects are cool. Early sequences use CCTV to establish themselves until they actually get to the Freddy's when that's suddenly dropped. A lack of jump scares is usually a good thing but considering the source material it's weird there's so few present.The score by the Newton Brothers is surprisingly good. It switches back and forth between being an effective 80s homage and just really eerie in a way that's actually more unsettling than the animatronics themselves, who make way too much noise any time they move and don't look creepy enough.",2023-11-01
"Does not fit with the character lore like the Afton family and the age ruined it. It should have stick with lore instead of a alternate reality of Five Nights at Freddy's. At least could have William Afton as the murderer in it. Movie is just like any other rip off version of Five Nights at Freddy's. Not recommended at all. Acting is fine so far but for the animatronics costumes with cast inside, it is difficult for them to act like an animatronics. I understand that the writers was given script and can't make changes to it at all. Should have at least some references to the original lore of Five Nights at Freddy's.",2023-10-30
"Creating a story in the context of a franchise like FNAF should have been a relatively straightforward task, given the rich lore and established characters. However, it appears that the creators managed to falter in significant ways. While the visual elements of the movie, such as the scenery and costume designs, were commendable to some extent, these superficial aspects should have been just the tip of the iceberg.The fundamental issue lies in the mishandling of the established lore and the names of the characters. FNAF already possesses a complex and intriguing backstory, and it is disappointing to witness how the film failed to honor and expand upon it in a meaningful way. Instead of capitalizing on the well-established universe, the creators appear to have disregarded it, leaving fans and enthusiasts deeply unsatisfied.Vanessa's character, purportedly intended to lead a suspenseful narrative, was one of the movie's glaring disappointments. Her portrayal lacked depth and substance, rendering her unable to effectively carry the weight of the story, ultimately resulting in a dramatic failure.Additionally, the movie's pacing left much to be desired. A well-constructed horror narrative relies on a careful balance between tension and release, but it seems that the film failed to strike this equilibrium. The result was a viewing experience that felt disjointed and lacked the necessary buildup and payoffs expected from a FNAF adaptation.In conclusion, it is regrettable to witness the mismanagement of such a promising concept. While the visual elements demonstrated some effort, the core elements of storytelling and character development fell far short of what the FNAF franchise and its dedicated fanbase deserved. The film's shortcomings raise questions about the decision-making processes involved in its creation and the missed opportunity to create a compelling addition to the FNAF universe.",2023-10-28
"So I finally get to see Five Nights at Freddy's movie, and it was pretty entertaining and it was also fun, when it comes to video games you've grown to love as a true fan of many genres you like to reconsider playing, and then make a pretty good fun film based on video games, but only if you have to tell a really good story.Don't get me wrong, there are some video game movies that are good and some are bad with terrible story or writings, but sometimes you just gotta live with it, most of the time.Josh Hutcherson did a really good job with his performance, and Matthew Lillard tho, he's the right guy, and the right man for the job to steal the whole show with his powerful acting skills.First he was Stu Marcer from Scream and then Shaggy from Scooby-Doo movies, but now for FNAF, I think you'll definitely enjoy this movie when you come to realize that it's a pretty good video game movie when you get around with many video game genres.But either, I had a lot of fun, and I say this movie deserves a sequel, no matter how long it takes, but Five Nights at Freddy's movie needs another sequel, because Blumhouse and Scott Cawthon did a pretty good job with there creative skills of horror and scares, and all the fun you'll have at the movies!8/10.",2023-10-28
"All-in-all, the film was kinda mid, and it was largely due to the script.The character of Mike is probably the most thought-out person in the film. Mike is deeply flawed, likely depressed, stressed, and with past trauma, which would explain why he has such a hard time keeping a job. Because of this, he cannot see the solution right in front of him, which is to sell the house.The notice of delinquency, which obviously doesn't refer to child support since Abby (his sister) is with him, is likely from the IRS or Mortgage company.Selling the house and moving would allow him to pay off his debts, give him a fresh start, and move somewhere else with more work to suit his talents. It would also allow him to get away from the toxic and narcissistic Aunt Jane. However, because of the aforementioned reasons, the obvious solution eludes him (plus the movie needs to happen, so...)The rest of it kind of falls apart, though...VCR static/damage/bad tracking seemed to have been created by someone who has never personally experienced those things. When a VCR tape is damaged or loses tracking, the whole image moves. The filter they applied (I'm guessing it was either Motion Array or Maxon Universe plugins for AE) was just applied on top, with a bit of image bleed. The entire image needed to jerk around, too. The tape was also too high resolution, and was clearly a progressive image when it should have been interlaced.The officer, Vanessa, says Mike's eyes are bloodshot, but they're clearly not.The people who broke in, what they did made absolutely no sense. They broke in after Mike had finished his shift, and after they saw him leave at the same time as the cop. So even if they claimed the break-in happened during Mike's shift, she could back him up that everything was fine up until he finished his shift.Other complaints I would just chalk up to weak writing taking the easy way to get to new scenes, or pushing the film in a certain direction...Why was Vanessa giving him a hard time about the pills? Why is he acting so shady about them? They're clearly prescription. It isn't a crime.She shouldn't even be implying he ""left a door unlocked"", or that he was ""wacked out"". She had no idea if he was even using it at work. For all she knew, it could have fallen out of his pocket or bag.Vanessa, in her own words, claims she can't wrap her head around why Mike would bring Abby (little sister) with him to work. She should already know why. Even though it's revealed a little later he has a secondary reason (the abduction mystery), what isn't a mystery is that he's Abby's legal guardian and he's struggling. A police officer in particular should understand parents (in this case, legal guardian), would need to bring their kid to work with them.Vanessa tells Mike to go home in the middle of his shift and seems to blame him for Abby getting electricuted, even though she herself witnessed sparks flying from the animatronic in question. She also knew exactly how dangerous they were from the beginning. She herself is equally to blame if blame needs to be laid.Vanessa is angry Mike brought Abby to Freddy's even though she herself encouraged Abby to stay there by helping build the fort. She's a hypocrite.The Pharmacist steps out of line by questioning a medication prescribed by a doctor to Mike. He looks at the prescription, and with a disapproving face says ""you know what works for me?""... He even calls Mike a dirty name when Mike is having none of it and leaves, when it was really the Pharmacist's own fault. That was probably just a bit more awkward than anything else, since bad pharmacists surely exist.This could have been a great movie but the script needed some more time in the oven.",2023-10-27
"After several movies that have taken animatronic animals to the creepy extreme, I was excited by Five Nights at Freddy's screening as a movie. I don't play video games, but based upon The Banana Splits and Willy's Wonderland movies, I had high hopes for this film seeing as these other films had ideas similar to this or based upon some idea of this video game.And Freddy's is just sort of there. Acting is good. Story is good. Production is decent. Nice ideas and decent expansion for character development.But overall, Freddy's just meanders through the story without much in terms of tension or suspense. They tie the story lines together nicely, although these were obvious. And it just resolves itself. Elements are taken out of the action, and viola, no more issue. Nothing seems to have much weight, and the solutions are pretty simple.I ""liked"" it overall but with much criticism. Not bad but not something that I want to watch again or need a sequel. Josh Hutcherson does an excellent acting job though pulling away from his typical type of role.(Ultimately, I'd like a sequel to Willy's Wonderland and more of that gonzo Nicolas Cage character.)",2023-10-29
"As a longtime fnaf fan, the Fnaf movie is wonderful and disappointing in equal measure. The acting is alright, with the three leads of Mike, his Sister Abby and Vanessa being quite strong, and the rest of the cast, especially Steve Raglim, being aggressively unconvincing. Steve does have some funny moments, which is not uncommon in the film, as even though its a horror movie, there are a lot of good laughs as well. Youtube enjoyers will certainly enjoy seeing some familiar faces on the big screen. One thing that the movie absolutely nails is the visuals. Never has Fnaf looked more alive than in this movie. The team at Jim Henson did an amazing job with the animatronics, and they finally look as I always imagined then to be. Their movements are extremely fluid, and look straight out of a robot workshop. Their designs are fantastic as well, with Chica and Foxy looking absolutely incredible. The animatronics also work very well as both antagonists and deuteragonists. They are creepy, yet charming, intimidating, yet welcoming, which I think is perfect for the haunted animatronics that they are. Speaking of the characters, this is something that I am quite mixed on. Mike is done very well, the audience is given time to understand him, and he is both likable and flawed; a great main centerpiece to ground the story together. Abby is also a great addition. While her character can be simplified to a simple ""little girl character"", she certainly stands out in her own way. She is just as likable as mike, with a quick mouth and a smart mind. Vanessa is ok, but I just think the film did not give her enough time to develop as a character. We are told that her dad roughed her up, but thats about it. Her motivations, and deeper psyche are never really explored, which I think is a shame, since I think she could have been a great compliment to Mike. The movie even teases us with the possibility of exploring her further, with one solo scene of her just staring at a wall, but it never goes deeper than that, which I think is a mistake. As for the actual plot of the movie, this is where it loses me a little. I certainly appreciate the approach of giving the film an actual arc, and I loved much of the background behind the murders in the 80s, but the film is just very stereotypical and cliché. It is a story that I've seen around 100 times, and it really doesn't do anything very imaginative. Mikes character arc is good, but it is largely carried by how likable Mike is as a character, and his growth throughout the film is very predictable. There is also a considerable lack of tension for a lot of the movie, and the last act, where the climax takes place, is very, very short. The last thing I'd like to talk about is the horror, and unfortunately there just isn't a lot of it. The gore is very limited, and there just aren't a lot of very frightening scenes. This may be a big plus for some people, but for me, I watch horror to be scared. The film is clearly built with love, and really enjoyed the visuals and many of the characters, but I think the storytelling holds this movie back from being really great.",2023-10-27
"There's some good stuff in there, the animatronics look pretty great but they also were good about using sound effects to show their weight, there were a couple times that they could have shown off their strength as well but at least they feel heavy. The music was also decent though it isn't really in the movie a ton. The shot composition was pretty good and there were some pretty good looking shots, they definitely got creative with it. The sets were also pretty good they definitely sold what they were going for.However that's where most of my praise ends and I think the other stuff in the movie plunges it into a negative score. I think that they could have made the movie scary, there definitely were attempts at being scary but none of them really amounted to much and sometimes they were just comical. For example when Bonnie kills the old guy with long hair sometime into the movie the shot is composed as if it were a joke, like a bit about a guy who doesn't know that a thing is behind him, now if this was supposed to be a joke I'd say it was a bad place to put it but the only reason I think it might have been a joke is that the movie seems to be self aware about how not scary it is, when the bad ballon boy jumpscare happened I thought it was very dumb, then they did it twice and I was really confused and then in the post credit scene they do it again but as a joke, which makes me think that it was always supposed to be a joke but in the first 2 scenes where they do the jumpscare it seems to be to put you on edge so I'm not exactly sure what they were going for.I am also am very mixed about the characters, the main lead is fine, he doesn't have much of a personality or any interests outside of the plot and doesn't really feel like a person in any way and that's not helped by the actor just not doing a good job, he's pretty monotone for most of the movie but when he's supposed to be worked up he felt very reserved. His sister I have less to say about, she is a child character in a modern horror movie she's mostly there to be a plot device and it goes without saying that her acting is very not good. Vanessa is a white woman unsurprisingly, she's written a little odd but that might be on purpose and she does feel a bit shoved in at points but she's fine and her actor is also doing a fine job. William Afton is kind of interesting because he isn't completely new and is very different from his in game counterpart and I really don't like him here, from his first line he definitely seems off and they kinda lean into you kinda knowing that he's the yellow rabbit but unfortunately we can't really see much of him at all because I'm guessing Mathew Lilard was too much money for him to actually be in the movie because he is in two scenes on two sets one where he's trying to act normal but failing and the scene where he dies which is extremely lame and tame compared to the game or even some deaths in this movie I could probably go into more detail about the stuff I don't like about this William but I can only comment so much on a character that's in the movie for 5 minutesI also feel like the way they changed the plot from how it was in FNAF one makes some things less interesting, like how the pizzeria is abandoned instead of in the games where they are usually open and the night guard is there for what feels like an actual reason, the reason there's a night guard feel more contrived and it also disallows any scenes of the pizzeria in the day which I guess allows them to save in budget because they'd have to hire a ton of extras but it effectively removes some of the interest that was present in the games having to do with how this haunted pizza joint was also a semi popular spot when you aren't there. There are also smaller things like the animatronics stuffing people being removed and replaced with a Freddy mask ""SAW"" style contraption which I'm guessing is to keep the pg-13 rating since the the shoving and mincing into a bloody pulp implied in the game might be too far but they could have tried to circumvent it in a way similar to that of the ""Freddy eats a chicks upper half of the body scene"" which was just kinda silly and plays into my next complaint which is that the way the animatronics act sometimes feels like they are discarding the way animatronics are supposed to be possessed and not actual ghosts like in the games, the whole showing kids instead of the animatronics thing really made somethings feel less impactful since they essentially humanized the animatronics really early into the movie which makes them less threatening as a result and makes the movie fall into the creepy kids cliche. There were also things like foxy teleporting to kill someone which was really weird and probably would have been more scary if they made him run at the guy like in FNAF 2.The pacing also felt really off even though the actual plot is fine enough. There is a ton of time spent toward the beginning on very slow scenes that are more supposed to flesh out characters and start the plot which is fine but it feels like it keeps this momentum until the 2nd act ends. It is just slow and that would be fine but they really decided to put the pacing into hyper drive for the third act because it really goes by like road runner which would be fine if the movie was more fast paced before that but it isn't which gives a feeling that they should've given more time to flesh out the ending instead of having a slow pace for the entire movie and then the ending feeling underdeveloped.Overall I wanted to like the movie but there are just so many baffling decisions made that make it not good.",2023-11-01
"It started out strong. A good cast and the animatronics were done very well. Mike is clearly down in the dumps. Cannot keep a job, has his sister Abby whom he loves, but his aunt is seeking custody so he desperately needs a good job. He is haunted by seeing his brother Garrett kidnapped from a park outing when he was 12 and relives the scenes through dreams every night. He is offered a job. The pay is not great, and the hours are worse. It is a night security guard at a closed pizza play place. It was abandoned after some children seemingly disappeared from there. Mike plays the role of a down and out person very well. But having to chose between losing Abby and taking the job, he takes the job. All he has to do is stay awake at night and make sure no one breaks in. But things do go bump in the night. One night, Vanessa, a police officer, stops by as the place is on her beat. She tells him some of the history of the place, and shows the animatronics. A couple of days later, Abby's babysitter works with three others to break in and wreck the place, so Mike will lose his job, and the aunt will get Abby. That didn't turn out well. From here on, it starts to get excessively complex and in some ways confusing. This detracts from the movie that didn't need to happen.",2023-10-30
"Anyway it's hard to write an exciting plot based on this game... I think this plot is more like a plot of some cartoon, not a film. However it's far different from the video game and for me was rather unexpected. Don't expect that the security guard Mike will be sitting in a room with CCTV through the film, he won't. Moreover, he won't be the only victim of animatronics.Except for Mike there was a police officer, who was also engaged in investigation of animatronics night activity for some reason (no spoilers at this point) as well as Mike's younger sister, who eventually was the one to get everyone in troublejust becauseofher own curiosity.I can't say it is a scary film at all. It only has about 6 screamers. Well, there also were some disgusting scenes at the end, but they are more disgusting, than scary. And in my view, they'd better didn't include them, as I find them disrespectfulfor the viewers.All in all, fans of the game can see the other, extended legend of what's happening in pizzeria. But don't think this will be a masterpiece. I would rate it as 6.5 out of 10.",2023-10-26
"After following the game for 10 years, I'm extremely disappointed how this came out. The story has basically 0 relation with the fnaf lore and tried to create NEW lore which isn't even true. (Vanessa being Williams daughter which is SO far from the actual truth it's painful) Sparky the dog had WAY too much effort put into it like for crying out loud it's not a real thing, the spring lock wasn't brutal enough as it should have been, who tf is Abby and why does the whole story revolves around her, why isn't there any doors mechanics, why is balloon boy in it MULTIPLE times (timeline doesn't make sense) because bb is in fnaf 2 which shows the original animatronics being withered and used for scrap parts so bb shouldn't even exist in this timeline, not to mention how the spring lock didn't happen til fnaf 3, in 2059. This entire movie was an entire joke. It's like the film directors just saw ""dead children in animatronics let's make our own twist"" like you can't do that. I waited a whole year for this mess of a movie. There was no scary parts, no jump scares, no true fnaf.",2023-10-27
"A stupid ghost story about a guy who constantly shows up to work and immediately goes to sleep. There isn't anything interesting to remark. Sometimes there's a classic Five Nights jump scare, but otherwise this is a bogus empty flick. I don't feel anything about the characters, and their development is uninteresting and not worth the tremendous effort. I would not recommend this to horror fans, ghost fans, video game fans, or even ceiling fans. On a side note, isn't it weird that Josh Hutcherson hasn't aged in, like, ten or more years? Anyway, this movie sucks. Animatronics look fun, but that's about it. Boo.",2023-10-30
"Five Nights At Freddy's is exactly what you would expect. The sole purpose of coming to watch this movie is simply for the sake of the animatronics and because you're familiar with the games. So the story and the characters are not exactly the motivation for you to see this. Basically they don't matter to you. I'm sure most of us can be honest about that. If it wasn't for the animatronics at all, then why else would you be coming to watch this??It indeed was good to see Josh Hutcherson. Of course him being a B list Actor, we know him mostly from the major works of the past he was in such as: The Hunger Games, Bridge To Teribithia and Zathura. For him leading this movie, he did good. He's never been a person that overacts. It was also good seeing Matthew Lillard, whom we know as Shaggy from the live action Scooby Doo and Scream. The rest of the cast did their parts good as well when it came to acting, but the thing is...for me personally...I didn't seem to feel enough sympathy for either of them. I tried really hard to, but with the story not being the most engaging to me, it was hard to pay attention and really care for the characters. Plus, a lot of moments in here are quite predictable.The animatronics on the other hand were very well done! They executed the look of each of them perfectly! They look exactly like they are from the game and what makes it even better is that none of them are CGI. They are all real standing, moving animatronics. So hats off to that team for actually making them come to life! The Freddy FazBear Pizza Place in itself is also well designed. They managed to create the same look of the place, along with the classic monitor watching that we very well know of.While this is a film I probably won't watch again, I came to see it for the fun of the animatronics. And if you're coming to see this movie specifically with that mindset, then you'll have fun with it. But if you're coming to see it not for the animatronics, then I probably wouldn't bother with it if I were you. Therefore, I wasn't expecting this to be the best nor the worst. So it sits right in the middle just about where it should be. My real rating for this is a 5.5, if I had to grade it by letter, definitely a C+.",2023-10-28
"Another week, another Blumhouse horror film.Based on a video game series (which I have no played), Five Nights at Freddy's is another 80s nostlgia horror flick. The plot revolves around a closed chucky cheese like restaurant from the 80s where the animatronics come to life and murder people.It's a great premise, and the film certainly sets up some interesting ideas, and wisely gives the main characer some agency. He's a down on his luck guy who after losing his family cares for his kid sister, but suffers the same mysterious dream every night. Personally, I would have found it more plausible and interesting if the dreams had begun when he started working at Freddy's which would make more sense in light of the nature of the dream and his interactions therein.Unfortunately, once the female cop shows up, the film begins to come apart. She does not act like a cop at all, being entirely understanding and way too friendly, going for a walk and sitting down with him at the river at their second meeting. Yes, this is (poorly) expained later on, but the writing of their scenes is awful.The best scenes in the film belong to the lawyer of the protagonist's aunt. He's hilarious. They set her up as a great antagonist, only to drop that entire plotline.The animatronics are well designed and sufficiently creepy, but the film shies away from violence and never really commits to being a horror film. It seems to be more geared towards kids, especially with the ""fun"" scenes of partying and playing with the robots, but I'm not sure it really works. Much of the acting is pretty bad (especially the cop), with the protagonist never cracking a joke and wearing the exact same facial expression the entire movie. The second half suffers some real pacing issues, but the worst part is the ham fisted exposition dump that explains the robots. The moment the mystery is solved, you can feel the film deflating as the suspense is all but gone. You instantly know how it's going to end.Matthew Lillard of Scream fame is there again and does what you expect him to do. It drags on too long, and outstays its welcome, especially once we realize the horror we were promised isn't happening.A pity. WIth tighter editing and a bit more energy to the main characer, this could have been great.",2023-11-01
"This movie took elements from almost all of the games and mashed them all into one, in reality we didn't even put a name to a villain until at least 2016-17, there were no really edge of your seat moments, there was a few good easter eggs but the animatronics were done really well, I can at least give it that, I don't blame Emma Tammi for this, I blame the writers because something happened in that writers room and I'd like to know exactly what went down because while I know Scott had a say in this how on earth did he approve the final script? I'm sorry to say as a fan since the beginning I was rather disappointed and glad I didn't see it in theaters, this is more of a 'I've got a couple hours I'll watch it' type of movie, not very good and that's sad.",2023-10-29
"But there are few films that aren't. It's nearly as bad as it sounded, but I try to not pay to see garbage, though I certainly have unwittingly done so, but this was available on Peacock. This made a small fortune in theaters even while streaming, so I thought a look might be deserved. Wrong! It isn't scary at any moment, though I wouldn't advise it for small children. It has quite a few jump shots that just don't work and it is silly, not funny, beyond words. It's not cheap looking and it has a decent lead in Josh Hutcherson, a good actor who hasn't been able to really find much success since The Hunger Games. He's very game here taking this very seriously, though he looked weary near the end. Horrible is not strong enough word for the lead female character. The writing for this role made me cringe and the performance by Elizabeth Lail didn't help. The little girl was okay. The ending is a complete bore and it's set up for a sequel. Hutcherson has gotten his big hit, but I cannot help but wonder if he expected or wanted it to be this?!",2023-10-29
2.5 out of 5 stars.Five Nights at Freddys is a pretty bad supernaturally horror film that aims to deliver for the fan service who has played the games. The movie itself is uneven with its direction. Starting with a supernatural mystery film with Mike (Josh Hutchinson) suffering from nightmares about his past with his little brother. And having several same dreams of 5 children who have disappeared. The film gets repetitive with the dream sequences which slows down the pacing. Its a slow first hour start. When things do pick up. The film lacks the thrills and scares.The acting is decent. The cast ensemble is okay. The music score is cool. Does feel like a similar score that came off from Stranger Things. Its a film that has easter eggs and references to the games which fans will love. The movie itself is boring with an uneven direction and lacking the thrills.,2023-10-29
"I watched this in release day and as it started, I was reading film reviews about it. I see it has a high rating but that's where it's confusing to me because I don't get why. I know it's based on the video game franchise of the same name but even still, there's nothing about this film that makes it good. Especially for ratings that are 7 and up. I did see a preview of this beforehand but even that just wasn't appealing to me.This might be because I don't play video games anymore but this was just boring to me. It's really not even considered ""horror"" to me. It's more like comedy disguised as horror. It honestly was just weird to me, much so bland that I started to fall asleep during part of the movie.I didn't care for this one.",2023-10-28
"Seeing the critics reviews got me worried, but don't listen to them! This is a movie for the fans and for those who want to have a good time. Not only is this about Freddy's but it has a storyline that attaches itself and makes sence into why the MC needs the job.Some Easter eggs thrown in there that were fun to spot
You can definitely watch this without knowing the lore or being a huge fan as it explains itself
There were moments where it was slightly scary in the sence you were on edge but this isn't very gory horror, ofcourse there were scenes but this isn't a saw like gore movie so don't expect to see full on gore.However there were some scenes which did get me I'll admit.There was no way to capture the scare of the games as horror games are more scary than films in my opinion and the games are first person so it's not like you're there playing it ,but it's definitely an enjoyable movie based around the first game and I'd recommend a watch!(Stick around after the credits)",2023-10-28
"I am certain fans of the games will get a kick out of this, Which they seem to like so good for them I suppose. However, it is no excuse for the poor storytelling and characters.The over reliance on dream sequences and dumb characters to move the plot is very tedious and the actual horror have taken a drastic backseat which is a shame cause I do like the first game atmosphere a lot. The actual villain is wasted and rushed at the last minutes of the movie which made the journey extra tedious to me(specially that it's very obvious who's the villain in a this called mystery movie).I really wanted to like this movie, I really did but it really didn't do anything for me. Still, go watch it and make your own opinion on it.",2023-10-29
"I'm writing this with assistance of a hard-core 10 year old die hard fan.I'm not a huge Five Nights at Freddy's fan but I am by proxy. My other kids have grown up with it. They have always loved all things scary. So to say they were let down was an understatement. They actually called it ""horrible"". As an adult I tried to explain to them they had to make a movie that was watchable for everyone and not just the fans of the video games. That being said they were right. There is a scene in the middle of the movie, no spoilers, but it was just bad. Bad in every aspect. Another thing is, it was VERY rushed. They tried to get more story in than needed in their alloted amount of time. I'd give it a 5 for average. And like most other movie's there was so much that could have been improved.It is what it is. Another rushed Hollywood project cash in. I'm sure Scott is just happy to have it finally made but at the cost of true fans. My son was more excited by a certain cameo and close out song. There was no sexual content for the record. The movie is not scary. Some gore. Lots of cheesy bad. Since it was profitable before it was even released, which should tell you something about the rush job on low budget, there will certainly be another for them to cash in on.",2023-10-29
I cannot remember the name but I saw a very similar movie about a year or two ago. That one was terryfiying but not too much; however compared with this a masterpiece.The story does not make a lot of sense and twists are too predictable; in fact being a PG 13 leaves most of the blood and language out.The horror is very basic and some moments really absurd; so do not expect to be scared; in fact sometimes is too tender for its own good.The actors do what they can and do not it bad; but evem for them some dialogs and scenes are too dumb to be taken serioustly.The special effects are fine but are not that used so do not expect much.,2023-10-26
"This movie is devoid of anything that makes a horror movie enjoyable to watch. Scary? No. Gory? No. Tension? You're not going to find any of that here. Drags on and on with the lame attempt at a backstory to make the main character sympathetic.Why was the writer so hellbent on making this about an abduction? It added nothing and sucked all the energy out of the film, making it drag on and on with almost no payoff in the end.It's hilarious that a movie based on a jump scare video game is taking itself so seriously. If you want countless eye roll inducing heartfelt monologues, than this movie is for you.",2023-10-30
"Five Nights at Freddy's has absolutely no idea what kind of ride it wants to be. A movie that feels like it's been machine-learned and reverse-engineered from YouTube fanfic, rather than rooted in any kind of recognizable human experience, behavior, or psychology.There are moments where it feels like it could have become a more gleefully mean-spirited horror ride by really sinking its teeth into the story and actually biting down, but it remains hamstrung by the rating as well as a lack of creativity. Five Nights at Freddy's fails at being scary. The premise and setting should've made it an obvious horror win, but some baffling story choices and poor execution makes it feel like a missed opportunity.My Rating : 4/10.",2023-10-28
"And a 7-year-old child can watch something like that! The most horrifying part of the movie is when the main character gets scared by a balloon boy figure. Everything else was very peaceful. Very disappointed because what is promised a a horror movie ends up being something like the movie: Let's play with the animatronics and make a tent together. There were some parts of the movie that should be cut because they are very boring and existential problems. It should be mentioned that I seem to be missing something at the end, as if they worked better at the end than on the existential problems of the characters. It seemed to me that there was a strong emotional bond between Mike and Vanessa and I would have liked to see them at least kiss. In the end, instead, Vanessa ends up in the hospital bed and is in a coma and Mike comes to visit her. I feel it seems like the ending is a bit left up in the air......",2023-10-29
"If films were about visuals alone this would be at least a 9 but they're not, this film imo totally lacks substance so I think I was pretty generous with my rating of 6.I found myself falling asleep at least three times throughout the first hour because honestly it was so boring to me, I kinda woke back up once it started to kick in properly but even then the storyline barely held my attention and I don't think I cared about what will happen to the characters at all. The twists were way too predictable and I guessed what they would be near the beginning which is probably why I fell asleep. That being said the acting was decent and the animatronics were pretty cool.",2023-10-31
"I have never played any FNaF games, but I know enough about the franchise through pop culture to have expectations. I came to see evil animatronics stalk and mangle people in an abandoned pizza place. Instead I got what I get in many modern horror films: a 90 minute grief counceling session with bits of very light horror spinkeled in here in there. We spend hardly any time at Freddie's at all. We do spend a lot of time in Mike's dull and very repetitive dreams. And no, Nightmate Freddie does not make an appearance.This movie suffers from a serious case of script-itis. I get that the story needs some padding out to make it feature length, but things get so conveluted without getting interesting that the filmmakers completely loose sight of what we came to see. Killer. Animatronics.It's a real shame that the company that made the best killer doll movie in recent memory with M3GAN turned a beloved franchise with endless potentional into this terrible dud.",2023-10-29
"The original concept of this film began in 2015 4yrs before a global pandemic and it was under Warner bros...safe hands.They wash there hands of it and so many script changes and issues has cursed this beloved video game. The fact it finished filming in February 2023 and was released 8 months later says it all.The Animatronics do look good I will admit that, but who's stupid idea was it to go against the game and have they move on screen? The whole scare point of the game is they move but you never see them move you just see them in different camera shots.The evil aunt was a stupid addition five nights has a good backstory so why change it.Apart from the Animatronics I'm really struggling to think of a positive for this film.At 1hr 49mins long it's a painful watch, I just hope the sequal does it better.",2023-10-28
"Full disclosure: I've never played the video game on which this movie is based. But I was baffled at how lame-brained and juvenile the writing and animatronic effects were. If this were a rated R film, I think we would have been gifted actual jump scares and a heightened sense of fear. About three times during the movie I was ready to just turn it off.Josh Hutcherson has never been compelling to me for his adult career. As for the relationship between Mike and his younger sister Abby, that was kind of cute. But excessive cuteness/cuddliness (such as the scene where everyone builds the fort) is guaranteed to spoil a supernatural thriller.A true let down.",2023-10-28
"I have no prior experience with Five Nights at Freddy's as a game but if this movie is any reflection of its quality, I'm clearly not missing much.The ideas aren't the worst on paper, there's a few effective moments here and there and there wasn't really anything wrong with the performances but the godawful execution totally tanks any interesting ideas that might've been behind this movie. It's essentially two movies in one and they don't gel well together at all. The iconic FNAF elements that people are going to want to se feel wholly and totally out of place in its own movie.The script chooses to focus on all the wrong things filled with sub plots and pointless side characters I frankly could not have cared less about. Any sentimental moments ending falling totally flat and come across as cheesy in all the worst ways. These animatronics never feel threatening at all and anything that comes close to a violent moment feels so tame in how it's executed that they never leave any impact. The script is chock full of ear scraping, cringeworthy dialogue and even knowing nothing about this IP I don't think there was a single surprise in the entire runtime.I had next to no expectations for this movie and I'm still baffled at just how bad this movie turned out to be. I might not have every played the game but if I had to guess I can't imagine fans really finding this story satisfying as an adaption. I just didn't care about anything that was going on and I was bored out my mind as a result Ans those are the worst kind of viewing experiences.",2023-10-28
"Let me tell you, folks, I just watched the new movie, Five Nights at Freddy's. And believe me, it was a disaster, a total disaster. I've seen some bad movies in my time, but this one, it was just terrible. The director couldn't direct their way out of a toilet. It was that bad.You know, I'm a big fan of winning, and this movie, it's a big, fat loser. I don't know what they were thinking when they made it. The animatronic animals, they were supposed to be scary, but they looked like they were made by a bunch of amateurs. It was low energy, folks, low energy.And the story, it was all over the place. I like a good story, a great story, but this one, it was a disaster. I couldn't even follow it, and I'm a very stable genius, you know. It's like they didn't even try.So, in conclusion, the Five Nights at Freddy's movie, it was a complete and total disaster. A tremendous waste of time. Don't watch it, folks, don't watch it. You're better off doing something else, something much better. Thank you, thank you very much!",2023-10-27
"As a FNAF fan I think that I know quite a bit about the lore and oh my was this film packed with small details that few people would notice. In my opinion the film was amazing mainly due to the amazing design work by Jim Henson's Creature Shop for the animatronic designs, making them as game accurate as possible, while adding their own parts to make them feel as real as possible. The main part i loved about the movie was the amazing acting by Mathew Lillard as William Afton and the rest of the talented cast that performed on set. And to top it off the springlock scene at the end made all my hopes come true making this one of my favourite films of all time.",2023-10-25
"The gateway horrorI think this is a perfect movie for kids who are wanting to watch something scarier than hocus pocus but aren't up for the conjuring.The story is of Mike (Josh Hudgerson), he gets a job to take care of his sister, the job is from a guidance counsellor (Matthew Lillard) doing night security in Freddie Fazbears, making sure nothing gets in...or out. With a disturbing past, Mike uncovers some secrets that line up with his past trauma that haunts him still, will he survive the night?Okay, so it's a 6 for many reasons, it's not bad it's just much more kiddy than I thought. The dialogue is a bit goofy and the music is, fine. There is a tone in the movie that makes it feel a little pulled between ideas, not sure how I feel about it.Josh was good, I haven't seen him in a while but he was a good fit as the big brother, the animatronics where cool, freaky at times but there was a section of the movie that again they felt goofy, still knowing they were actual props is very cool !!The end was a little rushed, I think fans of the game will enjoy it a lot as my cinema was screaming at certain lines hahaha lots of kids which is cool to see they are getting into horror early.I love Matthew Lillard, he was in this a small bit but was my favourite, probably will be a second if this makes a lot of cash hahaha fun family Halloween movie, 6/10.",2023-10-25
"Personally I never quite bought Josh Hutcherson in the Hunger Games franchise, but that was probably because next to Jennifer Lawrence and her charisma and star quality he looked like a joe Schmo from Idaho.I thought he was good in this, a broken every man again but in this low key project he works
The subject matter is dark, very dark and the situation however absurd connects perfectly with the subject matter, only Blumhouse don't follow through as with so many of their movies, it shows promise then weakens, and ends up Meh
But for two acts it's promising if lacking in some much needed gore, we did Hammer we don't need Hammer, give us some pay off, we don't see any body or rather baddy get any comeuppance, and they do obviously just want to make another so they forgot to actually just make a great third act, in a way the premise got too uncomfortable for them and they bailed, I genuinely thought I'd hate this, but I didn't, in the end I was disappointed because I liked it and the set up, the subject, the scenario, could have been great, it could have been The Shining but it wasn't even Chucky! Blumhouse seems to have a blueprint for a middle of the road product that doesn't rock too many boats, and so studios feel comfortable with their low budget safe box office fayre, it's a great business model but makes for run of the mill cinema.",2023-10-30
"Fans love to defend movies that get blasted by critics. ""This is a movie for real people,"" they say. ""Not elitists in ivory towers."" Well, sometimes critics are right, and honestly I get annoyed that fans are so eager to line up for buffets of mediocrity and chow down like they're being gifted filet mignon. ""Don't bother making any effort on our part,"" they say to movie studios, ""we'll be satisfied with any crap you want to feed us."" Wouldn't it be nice if we held filmmakers to a higher standard? If your favorite IP could be made into a movie AND that movie could also be, you know, good? It's not actually an impossible dream. You just have to stop licking boots.Oh, well. It's just a movie. It's not like lives hang in the balance, I guess. But they did get my money, so I think I have a right to complain.Whenever a much-anticipated movie takes forever to get into production, the excuse is always the same: the filmmakers are waiting for the right script. Then you see the finished film and think, ""THAT was the right script? Surely at least one of the other two dozen options from the slush pile was better than this one."" Five Nights at Freddy's suffers from a standard plot involving a security guard with haunted eyes trying to pull his life together so his aunt won't take custody of his younger sister. Yawn. But wait, if you were worried the dour protagonist doesn't have a Tragic Backstory, you're in luck! His younger brother (a different younger sibling than the one he's raising now) was abducted from a campsite when they were children, and Older Brother feels responsible as the only witness. Do his recurring nightmares about the incident tie in somehow with the current spooky shenanigans unfolding at the arcade-slash-pizza-place known as Freddy Fazbear's? If you think they do not, you've obviously never seen a film before.Despite the story being so thin you could use it as tissue paper next time you're wrapping a gift, the screenwriters (including FNaF creator Scott Cawthon and director Emma Tammi) stretch the rusty plot mechanics to nearly two hours. Why? Who knows? Even the pre-FNaF cash-ins like The Banana Splits Movie and Willy's Wonderland were smart enough to keep the action under 90 minutes. The film is chock full of characters that absolutely do not matter, like love-interest/cop Vanessa (fulfilling the obnoxious archetype of ""character who knows more than she lets on about the scary goings-on but refuses to adequately warn the main character so he has no idea what kind of trouble he's getting himself into until it's too late for everybody"") and waste-of-time-and-talent sneerfest Aunt Jane, perplexingly played by the overqualified '90s ingenue Mary Stuart Masterson. I guess everybody needs a paycheck. The screentime dedicated to superfluous characters ensures that our main protagonists, sadboy Mike and his preadolescent sister Abby, receive zero of the development necessary to actually make them interesting or complex.There's exactly one good scene in Five Nights, involving a group of intruders getting picked off one at a time by the animatronics. Tammi shows the aplomb of a PG-13 Sam Raimi, energizing the sequence with rapid-fire editing and kinetic camera movements and suggesting violence with shadows and abstractions that feel like fun artistic choices rather than concessions to the MPAA. Would that Tammi had been let off the leash more often. As we were treated to the umpteenth scene of Josh Hutcherson attempting to interrogate ghosts in his repeating dream, I kept myself awake by pondering why Cawthon was apparently so insistent that his hollow, schlocky video game premise be turned into this turgid melodrama instead of an adrenaline-fueled, no-holds-barred free-for-all. The final showdown, unfortunately, commits the greatest sin of all: anticlimax.My two notes of genuine appreciation for the film come down to the impressive, full-size animatronics created by the Jim Henson shop--thank God the film avoided CGI--and Matthew Lillard working his butt off to be the same gleeful scenery-chewer he was back in Scream, albeit with a much weaker character this time around. Other than that, I suppose I'm just glad the film avoids the same cynical, empty ""wokespeak"" that plagues other franchises aiming for Gen Z (not a self-conscious reference to ""patriarchy"" or ""gaslighting"" throughout the entire runtime, wonder of wonders). It's a tired movie, but at least it's merely tired in its old-fashioned storytelling rather than in a futile attempt to be up-to-the-minute as bait for ""teh kidz"".If you're going to see it, see it in the theater, with fans of the video games attending in full cosplay regalia, cheering at Easter eggs and applauding any moment that musters even a smidgen of genuine entertainment value. I did, and the atmosphere accounted for about 80% of the actual fun quotient of the entire experience.",2023-10-31
"Throughout the film there are intense and graphic bloody scenes, including scenes of dismembered body parts, dead bodies that have sustained grotesque injuries, and significant amounts of blood. There are many scenes of intense peril (most scenes are of intense peril, in fact). I was genuinely shocked at the amount of violence and blood in this movie, there was more of that in this PG-13 movie than in any other PG-13 movie I've seen , and even more than in some rated R horror movies I've seen. This movie has a higher on-screen body count than the most recent installment in the Conjuring franchise. I personally wouldn't recommend bringing a child to see this movie, unless they were a teen and/or has grown up watching movies of this calibre.",2023-11-01

If you cant make a movie right dont do it at all, if you cant handle violence dont make a movie that should be gruesome.

"This is a movie for the fans of the first few Five Nights at Freddy's games and for fans of a nice scary/mystery movieThis isn't a movie for people wanting an extreme horror movie or the next movie of the year who are ready to critique everythingThe movie is a departure from the games but that isn't saying much when the original game it's based on is just a guy sitting in an office for 6 hours while looking at a computer screen. The movie effectively used the little bits of lore in the first game and made an interesting story out of it.Set design was really good, lighting had many interesting moments, the horror aspect used the mascot horror effectively and the plot was decent. All in all it played to the strengths of the mascot horror genre while keeping the mystery aspect interesting.",2023-10-28

"The first hour was literally the most boring thing in the film. The story was super out of place, like literally, knowing the lore, it was ABSOLUTELY made up. Lore inaccurate, even one of the names was changed for some reason. The movie makers were trying WAYYY TOO HARD to create a horror film but just made cheap jumpscares and a boring story.Spoiler!!!!! Spoilerrr!!!There was no Puppet or Golden Freddy, only some cheapass Baloon boy jumpscares xdThe springtrap failure was the most disappointed sh.. EVER. My guy is getting his bones and guts smashed and doesn't even make a sound??? No blood whatsoever. It was also lore inaccurate.",2023-10-28
"I have to admit... in an era where video game adaptations fail most of the time, I kept my expectations for this movie low on purpose.Despite this, a very small part of me was hoping this would be a character based drama/horror with a focus on the messed up story behind the Freddy's Fazbear's Pizzeria.Instead, it was a very mediocre movie that will likely not break any records as a video game adaptation.The Pros: Amazing looking Animatronics, great setting.Cons: Incredibly convoluted story with many missed opportunities, rushed ending, lack of horror, jumpscares don't work at all, PG-rating, poor decision making from characters due to a terribly written screenplay.As someone who is only familiar with FNAF on a surface level, this movie just didn't work for me.However, some fans might disagree, although even the most hardcore lore fans will have to admit that certain elements or parts of the movie just don't work.If they ever make a sequel, I just hope it's better than this. This one gets a 5/10 for me.",2023-10-26
"Five Nights at Freddy's is a horror movie that is based on the game series of the same name. It is written by Scott Cawthon and a few others and is produced by Jason Blum while also being directed by Emma Tammi. The film follows Mike Schmidt (Josh Hutcherson) who takes the role of Security Guard at the old Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, after getting fired from his old job. On his second night he meets Vanessa Shelly (Elizabeth Lail), a cop who knows a bit too much about Freddy's. On his third night, he brings his younger sister, Abby (Piper Rubio), to the pizzeria. He falls asleep on the job as usual and has the same, reoccurring nightmare about when his brother, Garrett (Lucas Grant), was abducted by a mysterious man. On his final night, Mike has to race to save Abby from becoming one of them. He is helped by Vanessa but she reveals who she truly is, and who the man that abducted Garrett and murdered the five kids was William Afton, her father. Mike stops the animatronics from hurting Abby briefly before William Afton (Matthew Lillard), in the SpringBonnie spring lock suit that he murdered the kids in, arrives and fights Mike. He tries to get Abby but is stopped by Vanessa, who he then stabs. While he deals with Vanessa though, Abby draws a picture to show the animatronics that William is the bad man who hurt them. The animatronics turn on William and the Cupcake bites at the suit, exposing the spring locks. The spring locks snap shut on William and he yells ""I always come back!"" before falling to the ground where he is then dragged away. Mike and Abby visit Vanessa in the hospital and the movie ends there. Overall, Five Nights at Freddy's is a great horror film with jumpscare's, comedy, shocking reveals and fan service for all the Fnaf nerds. The movie might not be for everybody and that's fine, but this is a movie that I wholeheartedly loved. 10/10 would recommend.",2023-10-26
"It's unlikely you'll ever see something this incompetent, boring and slow be so highly regarded by an army of devoted online fans again - until the sequel is made at least. It's made for fans to do the Leonardo pointing meme at the screen for the rote references/ cameos and nothing more.Such is the fan power to thrust a ""horror"" adaptation that is so disinterested in trying to use what made the first game a viral sensation - possessed animatronics hunting and jump-scaring an almost helpless security guard - in favour of tedious amounts of justification for nonsensical plot points and lore exposition dumps that drag the pacing to a crawl. None of the twists surprise, all heavily predictable or meaningless (or entirely expected by lore gurus) while every jumpscare attempt pales in comparison the games. Freddy and co might be impressive practical recreations but they're utterly stiff when visible, only actually able to attack when off-screen which leads to an unintentionally hilarious dream sequence. They just don't do much given their capabilities, and the cupcake gag becomes overplayed. There didn't need to be gore to be scary - just good directing, writing, staging and sound, none of which is here.Performance wise, only Mathew Lillard does anything to entertain the absurd (it always has been, just admit it) premise with a bit of hammy acting for the very few short minutes he's there. The rest are mostly monotone or just poor; I never understood why Abby hated her aunt so much and would prefer her disinterested brother Mike (a sleepy Josh Hutcherson), other than the sloppy writing just making her a greedy Karen who the script forgets entirely. The actress for Abby has the worst line reads of the lot and never looks frightened, while the police officer spouts exposition and becomes friends with Mike for no good reason at all.As for that directing, the individual shots and sets out of context look fine - altogether however it's a mess, as if she wasn't confident about how certain moments would turn out and just shot it from tons of different angles for no reason with mostly poor lighting. Tonally the film shifts from attempted horror to drama, back into attempted horror, drama again, then an abrupt light hearted family comedy before shifting gears towards drama and poorly executed horror final act. That resolution to the conflict... it's just plain stupid. If only you could draw pictures in the games, or carry a taser.But none of this matters to anyone who has an emotional investment in the reception of this film. They've waited a long time after plenty of games, let's plays and lore videos to feast on, and they'll be damned if this film isn't an 11/10. Understanding Scott's convoluted lore doesn't make this better - only lowering your quality standards and being biased towards the IP will.",2023-10-28
"I think there was A LOT of expectation I heard of the games, watched some gameplay saw the hype all those years back and so the stakes were high!Does this movie deliver? The costumes are well done CGI, the mood of the early 00s is there too aaand that's pretty much it. The jump scares and not scaring, the story is SO GENERIC literally every single plot point is visible from the first 10 minutes and not even the twist in the end is twisting. I watched it on double speed and was still a little bored..It might be a great movie for children without the 2 gory scenes and with them included I feel like this is for the people that loved the let's plays and games/books and are now in their late teens/early twenties. It's about the characters not the story or horror elements. Just nostalgia for that fangroup.For everyone else I wouldn't recommend.

"I grew up with the franchise, so I walked in hoping to at least enjoy the experience regardless of my expectations.. (I did not enjoy the experience)The jumpscares were mostly cheap to the point where people in the theater were laughing. The animatronics did not look scary, unlike the game where I used to have nightmares and call it quits after surviving only one night.I would only say that Josh Hutcherson's performance was great. I enjoyed the cameos too, more than the movie altogether.I'm just disappointed because, like I said, I grew up with the franchise and I was waiting for this movie ever since they announced making it... and it was not worth the wait.And for anyone who says it is a good film, I honestly doubt that we saw the same movie.",2023-10-26
"9 years of fun and good moments reading the books and playing this game, and my honest reaction when I saw just 10 minutes of the movie was ""why?"". I know the movie has some things that are part of the lore of the books and games, but they have zero coherence. I dont get how Scott could mess up the movie with that plot twist. Vanessa wasn't even a fetus when the springlocks scene happened. William had 3 kids, of which 2 of them for the springlocks moment were already dead. Mike Schrit wasn't William' s son, like WTF. The animatronic were just like the memes in the last part of the movie. Everything from this movie has no coherency. The only thing I liked was the acting, and the designs of the ambience (the animatronics, the pizzeria..etc).",2023-10-27
"Firstly I have to hold my hands up and admit at the outset that I'm not much of a fan of the horror genre and after watching this I remembered why. I also have to admit that I only went to see the movie so that I was out of the house on Halloween and I'd seen the other movies on offer. Why this is a 15 certificate baffles me although there is one stabbing incident in it, so. Halfway through the movie I assumed I'd misunderstood not having read much about it and it was actually meant to be a horror spoof because it wasn't scary for on nanosecond. I know it's based on a popular video game so maybe it's aimed at fans of that, but I'm struggling to think of a worse movie I've seen in recent years. I think it has to be up there in the top 10 worst films I've ever seen. When I see movies as bad as this I can't help wondering what the cast thought when they saw the finished movie. Horrified?",2023-10-31
"It's okay. That's what I thought leaving the theater. That's what I think now. I've played the Five Nights at Freddy's games before. They're actually fun, and scary. But this, isn't. It tries to walk a line between a kids movie and a horror movie, but it just seems silly the whole way through. It also completely defeats the purpose how Josh Hutcherson's character keeps leaving the room or falling asleep or PLAYING WITH THE ANIMATRONICS. The movie feels like a joke, but it's going to do what it needs to do, make some money before Halloween is over. For a younger audience, maybe it's fun, but the most it will ever be is a movie some parents turn on in the background at a Halloween party.",2023-10-29
"I thought it was great! It was a good mixture of all of the games with some newer elements and even some bits of new lore to explore further in future films.It was entertaining - full of fun easter eggs and cameos for fans, yet containing enough context through storytelling to help clue newcomers in without being too overbearing.Any ""critics"" who say it's bad are mad because it isn't another melodramatic, monochromatic film full of sorrow that's next in line to win an Oscar then fade into obscurity with the rest of the boring, monotonous films before it.This movie is for us, not for them. Don't let critics deter you from watching. If you like this sort of thing or even just find it interesting then good for you - I encourage you to give it a try. If not, then it doesn't matter. You don't have to watch it. But make that decision for yourself - don't let anyone else do it for you.",2023-10-27
"As a huge FNAF fan, this movie was disappointing, pacing was rushed, plot was cringeworthy and completely different to the original games. They should have made it more like FNAF1, which had had a serious tone, creepy atmosphere and subtle, yet horrifying details. That's what makes FNAF and its lore so interesting, it's mystery and subtle details about what happened in the pizzeria, that fear of unknown. Instead, we got everything spoonfed to us halfway through and it completely ruined this movie. It feels like it was purely made for children rather than being an actually accurate movie to the games.",2023-10-29
This movie was nothing but a waste of time. It was stupid and pointless. Glad I saw it on peacock then go to the theater to watch it. I expected a better story to this movie. The trailer makes it seem so scary but the real viewing experience makes the perspective less interesting by the minute. The acting was so weird especially by the little girl. The writing to this movie looks like there's a fear of Chuck E. Cheese. I bet the video game would be more enjoyable than the movie. What's the point of this movie anyway? Truly this is a wild imagination. I'm surprised anybody enjoyed it. No little kids should watch this. This could traumatize them for life.,2023-10-27
Love it because the mastalgia from early 2000s is just heavy in it it feels like such a great adventure at the same time it feels like a big mystery and it really takes a hold of you in terms of how the story is played out and you get to really love Freddy and the friends and how great it is because it's just the movie like nothing else in terms of the elements of the atmosphere everything involves into this movie it takes you and grabs you and just sucks you right in because it's his own universe that's unmatched by anything I've ever seen and it's amazing to watch this and just enjoy story!!,2023-10-28
"Brilliant, made exactly how it should have been. Everything was perfect 😍. Scary,funny,sad it was all I could have asked for and more. Can't wait for the other movies which there hopefully will be 🤞 perfect film. Any FNAF fan should be proud of what has been made and will love every moment thanks to the clever hidden details and certain scenes. Even if you are new to the franchise this is a fantastic horror made by the incredible BLUMHOUSE. The scares are sure to make you jump and the plot is great too. Honestly couldn't be better. Seeing the iconic animatronic characters come to life is truly incredible and almost like a dream come true from being such a big fan. It's a must watch for anyone.",2023-10-25
"It's hard for an adult to watch such a tall tale, it's more for children - but children can't watch because of the scenes of violence, too, so the question arises - who is it for? Apparently, for fans of computer games. The creators tried, and came up with motives, conflicts, but they are sewn with ""white threads"" - that is, conditionally everything was tolerable, more or less justified, but such nonsense, but, again, I don't want to scold the film.The weakest part of the film is the direction and the script, but again, I don't want to criticize, this is a film, this film is for a special audience. I had to put a lot of effort into finishing the viewing.",2023-10-27
Okok so I watched this move thinking this movie was going to be a horrible fan serviced movie and I am a fnaf fan I love the series.when I watched the movie it explained the story enough for you to think about it and someone who I watched it with wasn't a fan and still enjoyed the movie the pacing of the movie was great the cameos where done perfectly the references the end credits everything about it was awesome the only true problem I had with it was it not being more bloody but hey I think it was best that it wasn't and I also think this movie coulda made it more lore accurate but good movie. I recommend for fans you would have an amazing time totally worth the wait a lot of people hate on this movie over lore and saying it's all over the place and I'd say there wrong they obviously didn't tell u the exact lore but they showed you enough to understand it the animatronics where done well I feel like it wasn't scary but some parts actually got me and the ending was honestly really good it's not to lore accurate neither is is not lore accurate at all it's just a true gift to the fnaf fans sorry for the drag on sentence.,2023-10-27
"I WENT TO THE MOVE THEATRE AND I WAS SITTING AT PREIMIRE AND SUDDENLY I WAS ATTACKED BY A GROUP OF MEN AND A BRAWL BROKE IN THE THEATRE AND I WAS ATTACKED AND IT WAS BAD, I DONT REMBER THE MOVIE BECAUSE I SUFFERD A CONCUSION AND INTERNAL BLEEDING, I WAS RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL WHERE ONE OF THE NURSES WAS WATCHING HELLUVABOSS (whch made it even worse) I WAS CRYING THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH AND HEARING BRANDON ROGERS STUPID VOICE MADE ME SUPER SAD OVERALL I DID LIKE THE ADS BEFORE THE MOVIE BEGUN THO IT WASNT AS GOOD AS FERRIS UBLERS BIG DAY OFF WHICH IS A CINEMATIC MASTER PIECE AND THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER, I WROTE THIS REVIEW WITH MY EYES CLOSED.",2023-10-31
GREAT JOB SCOTT CAWTHON AND JIM HANSEENS CREATURES SHOP!!!! THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HOLLYWOOD AND MOVIES IN GENERAL ARE MISSING! This movie isnt scary but it has so much charm and does so much for the plot and characters. The plot was fun to uncover easier for the fans but still fun for people like my dad who dont pay attention to the games. WE NEED A SEQUEAL GOD BEST MOVIE OF THE 2000s! Eitherway simple plot but so much character. Not posting any spoilers so people wondering if they should watch the movie can know if they should watch it.... In short! HELL YES WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR SUPRISED YOU HAVENT SEEN IT YET ARE YOU DUMB!!!!,2023-10-27
"Stick with me here: I know next to nothing about FNAF, so this is purely going off what I know.It was alright. I wasn't much of a FNAF fan, I always thought it was overrated. That being said, animatronics had a lot of character to them, which I appreciated. They all had their own personalities and actions and in turn, that made them more distinctive than the animatronics in WW.The negatives were Mike. He isn't awful but he was sort of bland. I'm not sure if it's because he is the silent protagonist in the first game so if you like more of a blank slate character, then he fits. Vanessa deserved to be stabbed for her actions to protect her serial killer father (Matthew Lillard). Lillard as Afton was brilliant and I'm happy he was finally getting another killer role, considering he last did it in Scream from 1996.FNAF did have its high points but it didn't do much overall for me. Honestly... Willy's Wonderland did ""killer animatronics"" better.",2023-10-30
"The movie was expediently bad. Sure it had its positives, like the animatronics looked really good, and I liked the actor for Vanessa and Mike. But I stopped watching the last thirty minutes because im so confused and mad.First off the inside of the pizzeria was such a let down, it didn't have any of the iconic game elements, such as the drawings on the walls, the party tables, the telephone guy, and the backdrop for the stage that Freddy stood on. Secondly, what is going on with the plot? Who are Mike, Abby, and Garret, and when did they become important..? Along with the aunt, the babysitter, and the nervous lawyer?Not to mention the kills are cheaper than five below, it's one thing to have an off screen kill, but all of them besides the babysitter are off screen. In the game the security guard is killed with a jump scare, they could have added that to the movie, especially since the jump scares are such an important part of the games. The jump scares didn't need to be directly aimed at the camera like in game, but just a few jump scares, to help build the tension would've given the movie that scary sense.The whole movie was all over the place, and really cringy at times, like when they built the fort. Why would deadly animatronics build a HORRIBLE looking fort for some random girl thats not even apart of the lore? Not to mention the girls character completely sucked and just screamed ""look at me, im special! I talk to animatronics that kill people and they absolutely love me!! UwU!!""The special effects sucked, I've seen tik tok artists do better black eyes and tears. The movie lacked a ton of scary elements, shock factor, which is disappointing when they had multiple chances to add elements from the game but they didn't, which ie shocking because scott himself worked on the movie and made the games!",2023-10-28
"The cast did a great job. Abby's actress was actually very good and adorable. I wouldn't change much about it. It was pretty erie. The music in it was rather creepy and weird and I actually liked it alot. The performances was great. Josh did amazing as always. The only thing I would change about it is the animatronics. I wish they were alittle less bubbly and more creepy looking. They were rather bulky. But I still enjoyed it nonetheless. The story line was very interesting. I wish there was more of an explanation to certain scenes, like why or how was the main characters brother taken specifically or why did the owner find him to get the job. But it was awesome! Perfect for a Halloween night.",2023-10-27
"What did I just watch?! I didn't think it would be so violent. There was no previous material that would indicate that this would be a horror movie. Really Fazgames Ltd, I'm disappointed.This was nothing like the musical, despite bringing back old stars from said musical. I sadly cannot recommend this to anyone who hoped for a direct remake of the PG musical. There was no flamethrower/""chainsaw"" (hedge trimmer) doomsday device and that saddens me more than anything else.Also, they made the animatronics actual animatronics, instead of hand puppets; I mean are you kidding me?!? That makes no sense!!!Oh, wait; there were games that came out with actual animatronics and horror elements. My bad, guys.This movie is awesome.",2023-11-01
"The long awaited Five Nights at Freddy's movie is here, and what does it contain? Absolute garbage.Instead of retelling the events of literally anything in the movie, they made more of an alternate universe thing. William is never mentioned by name, Mike's sister is now Abby, the crying child is named Garret, and Garret was kidnapped. Did any of this ever happen in the story? No, never. Mike isn't even related to William in this movie.Also, the movie is barely scary. They should've just went R instead of PG-13 and made it ACTUALLY scary.If you know nothing about FNaF, then you probably won't like this movie. If you are a dedicated fan who knows everything there is to know, you might not like this movie. If you're looking for a retelling of any of the lore, there's no hope for you.Don't spend your money or time on this movie. You will walk out of the theatre disappointed.",2023-10-27
"My kids really wanted to see this being big fans. I'm not a fan, but I seen some stuff from from a YouTuber (MatPat), with his Chanels Game Theory and Film Theory... pleasantly surprised to see a cameo with him. Actually felt like it was an A List celebrity... films should do this more. He deserved to be in it, due to the amount of work he put into his videos about this franchise. ANYWAY, besides that, I thought it was an entertaining movie for the family (kids being from teens to twenties). I personally would have wanted more horror, but if that's the level they want, it was great! Looking forward to a sequel!",2023-10-27
"I went in with an open mind and very low expectations and I still ended up disappointed.The games were known for having an overall creepy and disturbing atmosphere with effective jumpscares. This movie had none of the unease, none of the creepiness, none of the undertones. It relied olely on jumpscares and those weren't very good. They were tame, predictable and many seemed forced.None of the characters were likable, the kid was annoying and insufferable. The cameos were cringey and obviously not well acted since it was done by people who aren't actors and the story is very slow paced and basically lacking anything scary 90% of the times.I could have ignored all that if the plot had been the classic survive the 5 nights with murderous animatronics, but the majority of the movie didn't even focus on the nights in the restaurant.And the times we did see horror elements, they were mostly implied or just not scary at all. It was a full theater, the majority of the audience were kids aged 13-15 and not a single time did anyone scream or jump in their seat. Which is a very bad sign for horror.The movie feels like an entirely different story that was rewritten to fit the FNAF theme. The animatronics looked great, but their movements looked like humans in fursuits.The only redeeming quality of the movie is Matthew Lillard's acting. He did an amazing job!",2023-10-27
"Yes, I gave it a 10/10 and I would have rated it 7 if it wasn't for the people giving it low ratings due to lack of gore or ""I don't know anything about this.""
Yes, lack of gore to get a PG13 makes $$ sense. Movies are here to make money, it's a business like anything else and they need to recoup their losses, and expanding the age tp see a movie does just that.Rating a movie low because you don't know the background? Dumb.This movie was fun, delved into serious territory with child kidnapping and had some fun jump scares. For an app game to be made into this is pretty good. It's a fun movie that on the surface you don't have to think too hard, but has layers to it that you can pull back if you want to read more into it. It did well without all the gore, and if they make an R rated version great, but not necessary.Spoiles:
Only gripe was knowing who the bad guy was right away. But the fort building scene was so cute. Solid fun!",2023-10-27
"Just Got out of a Five Nights at Freddy's Screening.I was Interested throughout Some of the Film, but after a while, I realised that it's just a Dull Film but I continued watching.The Plotline was there, the Soundtrack was there, the Horror was kinda there in a Couple of moments. But the Director just Couldn't Pull it all together Effectively.And then you have other problems with the film -1. 👎 The Lead Actors Performance is just not good enough to lead a film.2. 😶 (is this Horror at the level of Tweens and 13 & 14 year olds?) There were a couple of half decent Horror moments, but then it just Dissipates into thin air.🙇🤷3. 🐻 The Plotline, I liked the Plotline, but again it's a very ehh execution, it's ehh leaning into a dull execution.4.🐰When the Rabbit takes the mask off, whatever interest I had left in this film(which was already evaporating by the Minute) was completely extinguished after that.5. 🎬 The Director just Couldn't make the right choices and get this thing Firing on All Cylinders.Overall, Five nights at Freddy's starts off with interest and then it's just an egg timer ⏳ of losing all interest and losing whatever Horror Element the film had in the First Place.",2023-10-28
"Pros: Animatronics are amazing, their movement and design is the best thing about the movie, design team really took their time with them. If you wanna see the movie just for animatronics you won't be dissappointed. Movie keeps fans in mind, there are some cameos and they showed parts of the FNAF lore that fans would be most interested in. Special and practical effects look really good too.Cons: Overall direction is not good, they wanted to give a whole movie this hollywood look with many colorful lights that envoke 80s feel. Now it does look pretty but it doesn't stay faithful to the original material. Story is too simple and straight forward, if you are familiar with the franchise you already know what's going to happen. Acting is kinda dull at times too. But I gotta say rating is what ruins the movie. Because it's PG-13 a lot of violent and bloody scenes took place off screen or in the dark I just wish we got more stuff going on beacuse that's the entire point of FNAF.Overall even tho it's not that great and it falls flat I would still recommend people to see it. It is entertaining at times. It's so nice to see the franchise come to life considering everything that was going on and how long it took to finally make FNAF movie. I just wonder if it might bave been better in someone else's hands.",2023-10-27
"Where was the lore. Where were the jumpscares. Why did they build a pillow fort. I get that the animatronics were just kids and i appreciate that the movie humanized them and emphasized on that but i hated the vibe of ""let's all come together and stop springtrap!! Together..we are fnaf!"". Like i remember being genuinely nervous while playing the games and i don't think that that same thrill was conveyed to the movie. I appreciate the attention to detail and the little easter eggs hinting at things from the games, like shadow freddy and sparky, and the fact that they did that showed that they were 100% able to make the movie less like a teamwork and friendship movie and more like a horror/psychological thriller. Even though they were just kids, they were also killing animatronics. They turned against william so quickly because apparently the answer to all of this was a drawing? I wish there was at least mention of the security cams having limited battery, seeing them pop up in the cams more, but the only real good scene in that nature was when they went for the people that broke in. Objectively not a horrible movie, but disappointing.",2023-10-30
"I came into this movie during opening weekend with an open mind. I knew a bit about the five nights at freddys lore and played a few games but I'm not particularly a huge fan.I'll start with the positives, the visuals were very well done throughout the film. I found the cinematography to be the best part of this film. Another aspect I have to have credit to is the animatronic designs and the way they are presented on screen.The biggest problem I have with the film is the plot. I find that it was sequenced very poorly throughout the story. I didn't find myself interested in the story behind the main characters brother as I wasn't interested in him nor the rest of the characters. I found that my attention was focused on the next time I would see one of the animatronics. The characters were bland and uninteresting especially the police officer.The movie ends in a twist that, if the rest of the movie had been good, may have been surprising.My last problem is that the movie pays 0 homage to the video games that the movie was based on and I can't imagine how die hard fans of Fnaf feel about this lazy attempt of a blockbuster movie.",2023-10-30
"I've never played the game and I loved this. Don't listen to the haters. This was a wonderful story with superb acting. I was riveted the entire time. Nothing about this movie was what I expected and I'm completely fine with that. It was honestly way better than I expected.It was giving me retro, although I'm not sure it ever said when this movie took place. If I had to guess, I'd say probably early 2000's. Great atmosphere overall.I'd recommend for older kids and up. It's not really a kid's movie but r here's nothing super duper scary. It's got some jump scares and a spooky vibe. Kinda gave me Gremlins vibes, just less scary than that. I'd definitely watch this again.",2023-10-28
"I've been a fan of this franchise for forever, and this movie is... *Sigh*
I liked the idea of the movie, but what the hell is this? Micheal isn't an Afton, which in the games, it was hinted that he was, the actors were amazing, and the production was great, but the storyline is disgusting compared to the movie. Abby is a whatever character, she wasn't needed. But Garret? What did he have to do with anything? You could've at least named him Chris, or CC, like in the game. And Steve was the cover name for William? *Sigh*
They gave an uneeded storyline for what? And Vanessa's William's daughter? That feels like whoever wrote the movie was on acid or something. This movie was disgusting. Amazing graphics, amazing actors, horrible story.",2023-10-31
"Even as someone who avoids horror movies I didn't find anything remotely scary about ""Five Nights at Freddy's"". It's basically a horror movie for 12 year olds.Sadly, with the film failing to scare there just isn't anything very motivating about it outside of nice set / costume design -- the plot is very straightforward with ""twists"" you can predict 30 minutes ahead of time and the acting is just passable.Overall it isn't irredeemable but there's nothing that makes it stand out outside of its ties to a popular video game franchise. My guess is fans of the game may enjoy seeing it on the big screen but as a movie it is too mundane to stand on its own merits.",2023-10-27
"It's fine. I wish it was more like the game lore it was a giant letdown to see I didn't get a visual adaptation of a great story.but no. The only part that I really only liked was the intro because it felt more like fnaf yknow. It should have been more based around the family of William, mike, elizabeth, and crying child, and why was Vanessa Williams kid? What. These script writers haven't watched a lore video a day in their life. If I wrote it I would make it would aboit the lives of the Afton/Schmidt family and the murders,then the ending scene would be the fire from fnaf 5 make it like 2 hours then bam, it's done no sequel. Fans love it, you get money. If they ever make a remastered version tell them to watch lore videos. And actually listen to fans my god, I'm sad because I have movies that could have been great but flopped.",2023-10-31
This movie made me wanna throw up there was nothing like the lore f the original fnaf everything was predictable as shi and bro if you like this movie i could understand because no one who have hit puberty or one of the human species with no disabilities who have liked this movie because literally someone with autism gave it a 10/10 like bro the characters are getting railed every now and then with no original and generic lines honestly i have watched more than 1000 movies in my life and this one so far is the worst i don't recommend it at all absolute dog shi and horrible i actually couldn't find any positivity in this shi movie.,2023-10-27
"Dude wtf.. I have been a fan for so long this was my childhood and I'm still a big fan but honestly what was that... the animatronics building a fort with a child??? Mike not being Williams dad? Also when did vanesa get there... loved the experience to go to the movies with my friends but this is so lore inaccurate, trust I still love the franchise and fnaf in general but this was just disappointing like Scott come on... I was promised gore and all I got was some scars and a close up of the spring lock with barely any blood, I wanted it to be so bad that it was rated for mature audiences, just why??",2023-10-28
"Why. This movie was so bad that I made an account just to warn everyone else not to waste their time. I could pop a perc and still not enjoy myself. What the frick dude. And why do reviews need to be so long? There is literally nothing else to say. It was bad. It made no sense. I understood it, but it was so poorly written that I just continuously scratched my head and wondered why I decided to watch the movie instead of blowing my own head off. What was going on. So many unanswered questions, plot holes. And what did they do with the random bodies? Nobody ever found them? Seriously? Nobody? Be serious. Next time I want to waste two hours I'll go to the DMV. At least I'd get something out of it in the end.",2023-11-01
"Forget all the nay-sayers here . Unpaid critics. Being an 80s child, I was njoyed the nostalgia. Ripped from chuck e cheese but a fun fare. Funny it was written by a hard core Christian( not too much bible pushing). We all got to pay bills amirite?It was actually very well written and directed and edited. I brought the kids and they loved it but I did too. I caught myself nail biting a couple times( 40yr).I do recommend. Especially if you want to see a movie. It's in-depth and detailed. Good acting. Corny at times but it's not all about the acting it's about the awesome animatronics. They put a lot into this flick.$$$. Good story.",2023-10-28
"What the actual hell did I just watch. I was looking forward to watching a fun movie based on a classic horror franchise but instead what I watched was a rushed, poorly acted, sloppy mess of a film. I genuinely think that 400 monkeys on typewriters would pump out a better script then the finished product of this horrid movie. The only reason In was able to make it through this complete snoozefest was due to having friends to watch it with. I hope these directors can get it together for any future sequels because I do not want a repeat of whatever this thing was. This dumpster fire was a chore to watch and I would not recommend it, even to fnaf fans.",2023-10-27
"Let's talk about good things first:
Animatronics looked really amazing and real, they did a great job with them, cast is a bingo, cinematography and design is really nice, the lore was made pretty good (even tho it felt like it was rushed at the end)
Now let's talk about some things that I personally didn't like (just my opinions):
The movie lacked the point of the fnaf games and that is having a jumpscares. I feel like that was the really important thing too because that's the reason why fnaf is popular not only because of the lore but because of it's horror elements. The movie lacked that a lot. I guess there were myb 2 ""jumpscares"" which didn't even scare me. One thing that I really hoped that they would do is actually make it like a game where Mike needs to survive 5 days, losing his sanity, making sure he doesn't run out of power, make it feel like a real game so we can feel the suspense. Myb if they added more death scenes but since it's pg 13 we couldn't really get that and that sucks. First 50 min nothing was interesting to me, it seemed really boring but after 1h it got okay ig, we finally got some action going on. So yeah.. that's it, I do recommend the movie for the fans that know the lore.",2023-10-31
"I was sitting in theaters watching the flabby ford fiz gang and there was a scene where Fraddy Fizzbor Fazzed all over the screen, it really felt like he fazzed all over me and my friends (my schizophrenic medication isn't working). I loved the nude scene with the cupcake too, it felt like the frosting really went in my mouth! And at the end Oppenheimer dropped his nuke on the pizzeraria and I loved seeing the flabby ford fizzington gang get obliterated by the atomic bomb.That is why I put it at 9 stars.But honestly it was a really great movie and I would rewatch it any day. I gotta go my grandma's calling me up from the basement (my Freddy fazbear cave) to go eat hotpockets. See ya!",2023-10-28
"As Jason Blum himself said, ""This movie is for the fans, it's not supposed to attract new people into the franchise."", which is why so many critics are giving it bad reviews because it's not meant for them. Being a fan pretty much since the first game came out in 2014, I was so happy with every tiny detail, from the various cameos, to Jim Henson's incredible work on the animatronics, to the hilarious laugh-out-loud moments littered throughout the film. This is the best game-to-movie adaptation any FNAF fan could've asked for.The kills were incredible too !! Even if we only see tiny bits of them (what do you expect, it's a 15, we can't have too much gore (which, to be honest, we don't even see in the games themselves)). My personal favourite was Max's death, where she literally gets chomped in half by Freddy, and we see her shadow so we understand what's happening. I thought that was a really clever way of showing it.I know that a many people were annoyed that it didn't stay true to the original game's lore, but I'm quite content with Micheal not being an Afton. That piece of lore always got really confusing and annoying the more it got shown, so I'm glad they made Vanessa an Afton. It was sort of expected that Micheal would be an Afton, though, since we only hear his full name right at the end of the movie; in a scene where Mike is getting the security guard job, Steve (AKA: William) looks sort of confused by Micheal's name, which I thought - because Steve is William (which was pretty obvious if you know even a slice of the game lore) - he would've seen Mike's last name as Afton and thought ""Is this my kid?""Overall, the film was amazing, but really only for the fans, the critics don't understand that. It's another Super Mario Movie situation, basically.",2023-10-27
"I'll start by saying this, THANK GOD for streaming because if I actually paid serious money at a theater to see this thing, I'd be pissed. First of all, I want to give hats off to the cast. I think they were great and played their rolls to the best of their abilities. The problem here wasn't the cast or the effects, ONCE AGAIN it was the SCREENWRITING falling short and missing the mark. Blumhouse use to be a reliable Horror juggernaut for a decade or so, but they're really scraping the bottom of the barrel in the writing department. If it isn't the likes of David Gordon Green screwing up the last two ""Halloween"" movies, it's this dreck. I will say, the first 45 minutes were promising and I had high hopes, but the second half of the movie was simply confusing and downright weird. The countless confusing dream sequences paired with poor character development made for a very bizarre first watch. It even put me to sleep at one point. After I finished the movie, I had to go back and rewatch certain parts to make sense of what I saw and didn't understand the first time. Almost more than anything, aside from all of the plot problems, the film lacked any true scares. Having a PG-13 rating is NO excuse, the first two ""Insidious"" movies proved that. The movie wasn't scary one bit and I'm still trying to figure out that little statue ""jump scare"" that occurred no less than three times.It just didn't do it for me, and I went into it with an open mind, having seen ZERO promos through and through and without reading a single review. I was expecting to like it, but it got in its own way, just like most recent Blumhouse ventures...SMH.",2023-10-28
I just don't understand the hate this movie is getting. It focuses on a dark story and a brother / sister relationship over the horror for sure but it is done extremely well to the point that we love both Abby and Mike by the halfway point which adds a ton of tension to the final act.I've seen many people saying the story is 'confusing' which unless you are half a brain cell short of being considered a mental invalid I have no idea how. I have not played any of the games and know nothing more than the basic premise and I still followed this film easily and had a great grasp on what was going on. The story was mysterious but that worked in it's favor more than anything.My only complaint is that the third act felt a little rushed and I definitely think we should've seen the villain a lot more.Awesome movie and one of the best of the year. 10/10 for me.,2023-10-28
"I really knew absolutely next to zero about Five Nights at Freddy's when I bought a ticket and walked into the theater.Oh sure, I mean, just from sheer pop culture exposure I gathered as much through the years that it's about an old pizza place like a Chuck E. Cheese or whatever and the animatronic animals are all alive or something to that extent.But that's it.That's all I knew.I loved those pizza places back in the early 80's and I love scary movies and the trailer for this looked decent enough for me to give it two hours of my life.I wasn't disappointed.Nor was I lost or out of place with the story here.It's a good 2023 horror flick.But it's not for young kids. At all.At least not those under ten or eleven that aren't familiar with 5NAF themselves.The origin of the characters, that is, the robots it's somewhat terrifying and morbid.I'd say for teens on up this is a good movie for the season.I enjoyed several things about Five Nights.The performances by all the adult leads are commendable: Josh Hutcherson, Matthew Lillard and Mary Stuart Masterson.I also enjoyed Elizabeth Lail as Vanessa and jams by The Romantics!Love The Romantics!This movie is a tad long but not too bad. It could've knocked off a couple of nights and lost nothing.So, if you're in your fifties or older and the only Freddy you know around this time of year is a guy with skin issues who wears a red and green striped sweater, then maybe get hip to this new Freddy on the block.It's okay if you have no idea when you get your ticket.",2023-10-28
"Five Nights at Freddy's is a franchise that most people have been able to sweep under the rug for a few years at this point. I think after UCN, the franchise's relevance dropped off, until this film finally got revealed to be releasing this year.I went into this avoiding adverts and promos, going in opening night on the 25th with low expectations. However, if I said I didn't cry at the end due to how fantastically fun this was, I'd be lying.A good thing to keep note of is FNaF has never been a great scary HORROR game, and I think it reflects in the film too. Freddy's has always had it's fear factor portrayed in it's environment and atmosphere, and the film does too. With the plot being their to add layers to the disturbed world you see on the screen.Mike, played by Josh Hutcherson, gets a job at Freddy's for fear of losing custody of his sister, Abby, played by Piper Rubio. He get's the job through ""Steve Raglan"", played by Matthew Lillard, and is visited consistently by Vanessa, played by Elizabeth Lail, who tried to help in piecing together the story of the traumatic past at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza Place.The story, while bare bones in summary, is intriguing and mysterious in the best way. The film itself is not TOO scary, but has some pretty ominous scenes, and features great atmosphere. It's also got some decent laughs, and a few good jumpscares. It's also got a good amount of cameos and references related to the game series, such as Cory Kenshin who works as a taxi driver, and a special drop in rom MatPat of the Game Theorists.One more thing to note is the scenery in the film. Each shot looks so beautiful it's unreal, and I adored every second of it. Overall, I had no real complaints about Five Nights at Freddy's. Maybe it could have been scarier, but overall, it's fun for fans, and should be a decent entry for newcomers. 9/10.",2023-10-27
"To start off, I went in with literally no expectations. I just wanted to have fun and enjoy something in which I've been consuming media about for the last (almost) 10 years.I was super excited when the cast was announced showing that Josh Hutcherson & Matthew Lillard would be starring in this movie. Personally I think they both did a really good job getting across their characters, my only issue would maybe be Lillard acted/sounded as William Afton in the bunny suit. But honestly I was able to overlook it and mostly found it amusing. I looove that they went with the cannontical death of Afton as it made it sooo cool to watch.Love love LOVED the Matt Patt/Game Theory shout out with the cameo and even the ""but that's just a theory"" I think they did really well at throwing in a good amount of fan stuff like dream theory and whatnot.I think my only actual complaint was I didn't really like how Vanessa was played, specifically the speaking pattern in which Elizabeth Lail was using. It was giving off that one girl would makes short videos on how main female love interest characters act.Overall I had such an amazing and fun time watching this movie. It's definitely one of those that you put on just to have fun and get excited about if FNAF is really your thing, which it is in my case. It honestly could have turned out so much worse so I'm grateful for how good this actually is compared to other game adapted movies :)",2023-10-27
"HOLY MAMA, this had one job and it nailed it! I don't care what anybody says, this movie does everything a movie like this needed to.For starters, all the acting is on point. The cast of human actors surprisingly isn't the biggest, but they all nail their roles perfectly. And the animatronics, let me tell you disney is shaking, cause they are super life like.The movie plays around with different ideas and pieces of the lore, and fits them in to tell a new story. As much as I love FNAF as a game series, making that all a movie would be a mess, So to scrap that and just give us the essentials, and then build on top of those essentials in new ways is great.I'll end it here but hardest recommendation ever. There are many things I did not mention, but honestly please watch for yourself to see them.",2023-10-28
"I wanted so badly to love it as someone who enjoyed the games and the game theory video series on it but I just couldn't. Visually, it's amazing! Animatronics looked perfect, set design was flawless and the actors gave it there all but the writing really made everything fall flat. I'm usually easy to scare (and I enjoy it) but I didn't feel that horror genre excitement or suspense. The jump-scares were weak and not one person in the audience seemed surprised by any of them. I was pretty disappointed because I was excited and ready to scream. Even if the scares were good, the story was a bit boring. The cameo was neat but that was about it. Overall I'm just sad to see something that had so much potential fall so flat, especially with how good the animatronics and costumes looked. The person I came with fell asleep halfway into the movie, I wish I was joking 🙃",2023-10-30
The movie lived up to the games and gave the fans what they wanted! Perfect story with an amazing choice of cast. The acting was incredible and the springlock failure was amazingly acted by Mathew Lillard and Josh Hutcherson. Great experience throughout the whole hour and 40 minutes of the movie and i highly recommend people to watch it even if you arent massively into the original story! It takes it own toll on the story slightly and has plenty of cameos featuring popular youtubers who have played Five Nights At Freddy's Mattpat (Game theory) and Coryxkenshin!Five Nights at Freddy's is my favourite movie of the year and is a thrill to watch. 10/10.,2023-10-25
"While this move may not be the scariest thing I've seen nor a revolutionary horror film, this movie was everything I could ever wish for and more. The love and care that was put down into the Five nights at freddy's movie for the fans is astonishing and I havent felt this giddy and excited about anything in a long time.While it gave us lots of what we wanted and knew it also surprised in many ways that I feel gave the move an element of surprise and some fun vibes. I love that it in some ways doesn't take itself so seriously all the time to allow for laughter and fun.Thank you Scott and Blumhouse for a job well done, for the respect for the fans and one hell of a movie!",2023-10-28
"Who was this movie for?Clearly the market was kids, because it's a PG-13 film, but there are plenty of pg-13 movies creepier than this.It's not meant for fans of the lore. It barely follows the speculative story of the franchise, or the vibe of the games whatsoever.What could be a creepy film with huge, intimidating robots stalking you through dark hallways, threatening to literally crush you into paste as you're stuffed into a robotic suit; turned into the worst thing you could be in movies. Boring.You lay out all of the ""important"" things hat happen in this plot, and it can be summed up in a about five sentences. It was WAY longer than it needed to be, for what little actually happens.The only reason this is getting a 3 is because the set design and look of the animatronics is spot-on; besides the way they're animated. I feel like making them more stiff and robotic would have been a benefit to making them scarier. Everything else, characters, horror, plot, pacing, was sub-par.",2023-10-31
"I watched it with a couple of friends. The moment it showed and focused in the beginning with the lil sister and her drawing and showing all her drawings in her room I just thought ""her drawing is gonna save the day isn't it...."". To me that, the way the animatronics squinted their eyes reminding me of Fry, and the friendship happy silly moment in the middle kinda ruined it for me lol. I couldn't take it seriously and the issue is that the movie was trying to be very serious even tho it had those details and moments, so I kept saying ""what is this? What is happening???"" in disbelief.The animatronics and set designs were awesome, and I get it's target audience are the young teens that like the lore (even tho it still doesn't it follow it, it's more like ""inspired by it"").To me as a not big fnaf fan but I know the games and lore, but love movies and horror, I think a good fnaf movie should have either gone with two options
Make it an isolation situation movie, like Panic Room, or Alien,... where the main character(s) would be trapped in a place with these entities and their only way to see them or track them would be through cameras or motion sensors etc. While this entities roam and hunt them from the dark and corners. Focusing on the MOOD, to recreate that sensation the games give of knowing they are coming but don't know from where and the resources demishing.The other option would have needed to be really ballsy and go clear with the trilogy idea, and just make the real lore in movie format. And start the first movie with the killings and end it with the animatronics coming to life and have the second one focus on them and the third one with the box trap and the fire. Because all the killings of the kids and kidnappings and backstabbing has already a lot of horror and story to tell. Instead they ""showed it all"" in the opening credits through the nes pixel graphics.But if you wanna target the young fans too you probably wont be too horror and not have much violence... so...
So I dunno, it was fine, not for me. At least it seemed to have a lil more care and passion than just being a ""I clapped when I saw it"" cashgrab. But the script was lacking.",2023-10-31
"The fact u can't rate 0 stars is gross, the plot was garbage, the amount of cringe lines was said, it was not even jumpscary whatsoever, garbage. Whoever wrote it has obviously never written a script before, the directors forgot to tell the actors to act, and the one liners are so out of line it's awful, and did Matt part seriously make a cameo and say ""it's just a theory"" a peoce of me died in that moment. You've ruined my whole year with how awful this movie is, I pray to God you don't even ruin it more with a garbage time sequel. The ending was stolen from first novel book as well but wasn't nearly as good. Gross awful movie, script 1/10 costume design 8/10 directing 1/10 acting 2/10 plot -10/10.",2023-10-28
"The Five Nights At Freddys Movie has been very entisipated, by the community from the games, and horror fans. Me going into this movie as a FNAF (Five Nights At Freddys) fan, left me helf satisfied. Ive been waiting 8 years for this movie and it not fill all my holes and desperations. The movie starts of with a corny Scream like opening scene, with a crappy jumpscare. Throughout the movie it seems to get better and better, until the envolvment of SpringTrap, the games main villian. He brought a new type of scary to the film as we were getting used to the jolting mecchanics of the other animatronics. Unlike springtrap who was actually a human inside the suit. The movie got so much better untill one thing happened. After the defeat of springtrap, freddy would say ""Maybe the real Five Nights At Freddys is about the freinds we made along the way""
This one line pulled on my heart strings. This is trully one of the best movies i have ever seen.",2023-10-25
"At the start of the movie we are introduced to a mentally broken guy who has to take a suspicious job in order to not lose his sister to his uncle, and the movie does this in a great way, despite the cliche jumpscares at the beginning if the movie kept this way it would be a 7/10, but it didn't.As soon as the vandals break into freedy's the movie looses all of its terror, you see in a horror movie you need to give little to no information about the dangers of the situation while clearly showing it is a dangerous situation, for exemple having a character find a snake in his house while the sun is out and we know where the snake is won't create any fear, but having our character being locked in a dark room where they can only hear the sounds of the snake and nothing else will create at least tension for the movie, but here in fnaf you constantly know the limits of the animatronis, where they are and even what they are thinking ( by showing clear facial expressions of them) and that breaks all the fear, but that's not all as the problems, as the movie carries on you now know that the aninatronics are actually nice and they only want to hurt people because of William aftom + they can be defeated with any sort of eletricity and that all makes them as treatening as a little bug, and to not write a whole essay as a review I'm not gonna comment on the movie's plot twist, just know that I think it's really bad, and if you think that I have this opinion cuz I don't know the lore of the games you are wrong because I play the games and follow the progression of it's theories since the 4th game launched.",2023-10-28
"Some say the story was horrific. I disagree. The story was very good with a slow boring start. But everything changes as the film progresses. The ending is completely epic. It doesn't include all aspects of the lore, which was impossible in a two-hour movie. I don't care what others say, for me it was a super good movie. It wasn't very horror, but hey, FNAF became so famous because of the story.The actors played quite well, especially Matthew Lillard. He knew what William Afton meant. Vanessa's death was kind of unexpected, honestly. And the comedy part of the movie was also good. Some complain that the comic part shouldn't have been there. Bro, even the games had some funny parts. In the end, my opinion, as with other games based movies, is that people complain too much. The movie pleased me beyond measure, and I'm a big old fan.",2023-10-28
"Freddy and chica should have had maybe kiss in my opinon and it should be golden freddy probably too and why wasnt it markiplier?I also think that the security guard should be like the purpur guy from FNAF. There was no referanca to purpurl guy in the entire movie so i have to take some points off.I really like the Mail characters But fnaf World is so big so its so stupid to not have shadow bonnie or maybe even ballin boy.I think that overall its a good movie But considering Jack and mark and Leeds wasnt there i have to take som point off.I am definitly excited for the fnaf 2 movie
7/10.",2023-10-25
"I am positively suprised about this movie. Granted, the plotline was not something i was imagining, but I knew from the interviews, that the plot will be its own.As Scott said, movie was targeted to the fans and he knew not everyone will like it. As its going to be a trilogy, it makes sense that the first movies plot was kinda left in shadows to be seen. As it has been in the games and in the books.I might add that if someone who came to see it solely based on the games might not know or forget what from the animatronics came to life, they might think the movie was too boring or not scary enough on some parts.Animation, music, animatronics and the ambience was made really well and my exitement stayed all the way to the credits and a bit after it.It was such a pleasure to see my childhood horrors on the screen and ""alive"".I cant wait to see the rest!",2023-10-28
"Five Nights at Freddy's: the movie is an experience that feels as though they tried their hardest to appeal to the massive fanbase of Fnaf, giving us a massive overview of the famous pizzeria, bringing life-sized animatronics, and even featuring a MatPat cameo. Seeing everything on the big screen is magical to say the least, but truthfully, the enchantment kind of ends there, the show's soundtrack, casting, and shooting are nothing to write home about, but its convoluted storyline is certainly something to complain about. Overall, if you're not a fan of the games, you might as well see this as another Paranormal Activity 'bout a psycho trying to kill a dude whose sister happens to be friends with Chuck E. Cheese's cousin.The movie starts with Mike and his sister Abby (played by Josh Hutcherson and Piper Rubio), showing their somewhat distant relationship since Michael's little brother went missing. We also see that our hero has been trying to catch the murderer in his dreams with melatonin pills and the whole yard, but the cost of all this has been on the protagonist's shoulders, we see him having to give up time with his sis to work, and eventually, it leads him to the Bear's pizza place after a seemingly non-suspicious man gives him the job. To look after him, the mysterious policewoman Vanny tells him about the place, knowing an awful lot about it and on top of that, he is now dreaming about dead children. Overall, the first half of the movie is nothing but solid; they give the characters time to breathe and show their relationships with the world. We see Abby being kind of a weirdo, Mike being somewhat of a screw-up, and Vanny showing her caring side. It's probably where the acting is at its best; I had no complaints about the casting, and the production level was on a whole other level. The animatronics felt real, and the pizza place felt like the next Rock-afire Explosion eventhough that's kind of where the positives end. Although the shooting wasn't necessarily bad, it was generic, given that they had such a large and interesting set to work with, they just chose to take first-person or around-the-corner shots, I mean, there were sequences where the characters were dreaming, and even there it just feels bland and tedious. What was even more disappointing was the lack of violent scenes; this movie, even though it had a PG-14 rating, really felt like a PG. The action of the animatronics was mostly in obscure shots or cut-out entirely, which was incredibly disappointing given that the costumes were great and that's kinda were the fantasy of the franchise was, seeing the animatronics be murder machines but in a realistic setting was pretty much why I was there and the scenes are just the first thing that came to their head. Another thing that bothered me was the Aunt plotline; it felt out of touch with everything the story had to offer and honestly felt more like something they had to put in to avoid a plot hole. Although with these complaints, I feel as though this is the best part of the movie, you get to see pretty much all that you expect from the FNAF games, only it just feels underdelivered in some areas, especially the animatronic scenes.Continuing the story, we learn the kids whose souls were taken from their bodies to the animatronics all have one thing in common: they were killed by the yellow bunny. The kids contact Mike in his dream space to make a deal; they will, by some magic, make him dream-locked to his past, but in trade, he has to give up Abby for the lost children to have. The security guard accepts this offer in a moment of anguish. After regretting it, we get to see the Golden Freddy 'capturing' Abby to the pizzeria. There, they want to turn her into the Baby, but are interrupted by Michael. After trying to escape from the animatronics, they appear in front of the big bad himself, William Afton, the killer in the original series, where they have kind of a fight that shortly after is ended by the spring-lock failure .Vanessa is injured, but all in all, it's all good. This finale is the most disappointing thing about the movie, I can deal with the lack of gore scenes, I can deal with bad shots, but just throwing the whole plotline towards a cheeky ending is just sad. William Afton, or Springtrap, is never truly given time to grow in the hearts of new fans; he just kind of is mentioned 3 times and then he appears as the final boss, with the most oblivious character being him. Not giving him a motive, only giving one scene as William Afton, and one good look at the spring Bonnie design. There was no mystery, no build-up, no drama, and most importantly, no good reason. The character of William Afton for the FNAF series is the most important; he's the one that made all the games happen, and just to waste him is a horrible choice. Golden Freddy could have been the main antagonist; there were no reasons. The big plot-twist in the movie is that Vanessa is Afton's daughter, but because he's hardly a character, there is no impact. There is no reason to show this. In my opinion, he shouldn't be in the movie. But this isn't all. The movie introduces a new plot point: the kids don't remember that Spring Bonnie killed them, so they draw it happening, and that awakens their memories of the murder, which is just great. If you're wondering what happened to the kids, well, the movie lets the only part that they've actually built up to remain a mystery, only having a scene where Freddy does a scream. This later part of the movie is its weakest. It felt as if they rushed many things that they wanted to, instead of going with a simpler look. This made the story overall become a rushed mess that barely made any senseFNAF as a game had its fair share of things to draw inspiration from, going from a crying kid to a magical child that traps people in a never-ending hell. Without explaining the gigantic franchise, I will only establish this: making a movie with everything that the games offer is just impossible. The movie, unfortunately, tries instead of picking and choosing, opting to have kind of two storylines coming together: the FNAF 1 Golden Freddy and the spring lock failure from FNAF 2 minigame, this made it incredibly difficult to make it cohesive towards a whole plotline. In my opinion, dumbing it down with a plotline about just the 'It's Me kids' would have been a whole lot better, building the Springtrap character little by little, maybe teasing the puppet, but in its state, it felt rushed. As a horror movie, it's not that much, other than the typical, there's no scene that made me feel scared or frightened, it's more of a comedy and action movie rather than a horror one. Overall, the movie does pay homage to the games, maybe a little too much, If you aren't a fan, I wouldn't recommend it, there won't be many interesting things to look at, but if you're a fan, you'll have your dream realized, just in a very disappointing way, maybe while watching the movie you could rewatching the VHS tapes that might actually scare you.",2023-10-29
"I was genuinely surprised by how well done this movie is. The acting was superb, Hutchinson obviously being the stand out but the others as well; I thought it was well written and those mechanical suits were insane! So well made, expressive, and interesting to watch. It was great they released the movie on streaming so I could watch after my shift. I'm a huge fan of horror movies, from old films to international ones, especially the avant garde - and I'd recommend this one to plenty of people. It's heartfelt, funny, and does a good job of making you like the characters and fear for their lives.I cracked up laughing the first night when Mike just goes to sleep, I feel like I would have done the same working a (supposedly) boring night shift. There's a lot of scenes that I never expected but was pleasantly surprised by, like the fort scene. And Springtrap/William Afton's arrival had me gasp, even though I had known it was coming it was still well done!",2023-10-28
This movie was better than I expected and it was a breath of fresh air I hope they continue to make more. I'm really glad that Scott was involved in the process of making this film and I'm glad that the Director treated this franchise with the respect that I deserve. Jason Blum did a really good job producing The film. The animatronics are amazing thanks to the Jim Henson Company. The Cameos were amazing as well I loved that MatPat was involved that was a complete shocker to me. He really kept that secret really good. I really did wish Markiplier was in there though but I understand due to scheduling conflicts he couldn't but it was still really great movie.,2023-10-28
"Fun? Yes. Would I see it again, No. This is one of those movies where plot comes out of nowhere and left me thinking 'what!?'. I can see the potential, and I have always loved FNAF, but i wish they leant into the camp sort of humour that lies behind the absurdity of what's happening on screen. I think it almost takes itself too seriously. There were moments where I laughed, or cringed, but I don't think that was ever the intention when that particular scene was made. Had they taken a similar approach to the film that M3gan did, where she literally just dances and sings and its a completely bonkers movie, FNAF would have been incredible. That being said, I think this movie also needs a UNRATED cut. The film was marketed almost like a gory slasher, but upon watching, all of that felt removed.I really do hope they get a sequel, because I'm interested to see where the story goes and how they do it- hopefully learning from the mistakes of the first one. It was a pretty bad movie, but it could have been amazing.",2023-10-27
Honestly Not the scariest movie but I can tell you that it was the best horror movie I've watched in a very long time. The kills were amazing and the actors are incredible as well. The only problem about the movie was the story. It was a bit sloppy but do I care. Not really. I had no problem with the red eyes and the scene that when the cast and all the animatronics were making a fort out of tables and chairs. I don't get why people don't like that scene? Its pretty funny in my opinion. I'm happy cupcake got a lot of attention in this movie! The things he was doing were incredible and so cool. I recommend watching this movie and you will have a blast!,2023-10-25
"You sit through an entire 1 hour 50 minute movie, where very lame things happen, and they end up happening for no reason, and they make no sense. But as a viewer, you just have to accept it and watch. It was written by a 12 year old at best, random lines here and there that also don't make any sense. I am extremely disappointed that they even spent money making this movie.All the character's actions and dialogue just felt very cheap, I could not follow. The police officer hid the entire plot for quite literally no reason, then decided in the end to finally say something when the time was right (because the time needed to wrap up).",2023-10-28
This Movie is a huge fan fest and every fan of this franchise will love it.I understand Were the critics are coming from but complaining that a Movie based on a game that has you checking security cameras to be like that the entire time like wtf.I saw someone complaining about the Movie having too much plot and that Its confusing dude FNAF is known for having a plot that doesnt make any senseI guess they could have made the Movie better for people that dont know FNAF much But this Movie is for the fans and if you are a fan go see it in theaters.Its been 8 years and Its finally out letssgooo.,2023-10-27
"Hi all fnaf fans, i know we've been wanting to see this movie for a very long time, and anticipating a good movie. I was hyping up this movie for so long guys!!! The lore just doesn't correlate with the actual lore. Major spoilers, vanessa is william aftons daughter??? Micheal afton has a whole other family, where is elizabeth?? The animatronics don't remember william at all????? THEY HATE HIMM!!! The springlocks are completely different and aren't activated with water?? The set looks different from the actual game, i don't mind some differences but there's no metal doors, lights, and the ventilation system isn't even above the desk?? William also doesn't die like in the storage room in the og games too. Altogether from a true fnaf fan it was pretty disappointing, it's not hard to either make a spin off or keep to the original plot imo. I would :3 but i'm a :( rn guys.",2023-10-27
"Not every horror film has to push the genre to new places!When I was a kid, there were many entry-level horror movies that kids could watch and get into the genre.These days kids have to watch either A) the most brutal, gross-out horror ever or B) Mickey Mouse pumpkin patch. There is no in between and that sucks.Because of that, my wife and I are constantly showing our kids movies from our childhood, but they just don't have the same investment level.Finally- there is a good, entry-level horror movie that the kids love- so, of course, the critics hate it. 👎Forget them- this is a fun, mildly scary horror film for the whole family! Enjoy it, your kids definitely will!",2023-10-28
The ending was dissapointing as i expected the bodies of the children inside the animatronics to be discovered by and reported to police but instead it looks like hollywood is yet again trying to drag it out to make another movie instead of doing what is right for the movie.The ending was dissapointing as i expected the bodies of the children inside the animatronics to be discovered by and reported to police but instead it looks like hollywood is yet again trying to drag it out to make another movie instead of doing what is right for the movie.The ending was dissapointing as i expected the bodies of the children inside the animatronics to be discovered by and reported to police but instead it looks like hollywood is yet again trying to drag it out to make another movie instead of doing what is right for the movie.,2023-10-29
"I'm truly disappointed in this movie. I've been in the FNAF fandom for years now and I've been waiting for this movie for so long, only to be met with nothing, but poor pacing (introducing around 4 characters in the first 40-50 minutes), no gore or horror, wholesomeness while the movie is supposed to be scary, only one jumpscare and so on.The movie also had good scenes where I actually had hope, like the showing of Springtrap, only to be met with a character that I was just not expecting at all.I am just so truly disappointed I waited approximately 6-7 years only to be met with this bland movie.",2023-10-31
"Gadies and lentlemen, here is my honest review of the Fnaf movie, I have been a fnaf fan for 8years, but this movie was the worst piece of fiction I have ever seen. Firstly the start was alright, it set up the characters and built some suspense. However the 'we are Fnaf scene' was a real thing, the animatronics, Mike, Vanessa and Abby built a flipping fort out of tables and chairs and laid under it. Why were these animatronics, who have the souls of children inside of them after William Acton killing them and stuffing them into the suits, had a little fun play session with Mike, Vanessa and Abby. Then we see Mike go back to find out who took his brother all those years ago, but he has this dream and the 'friendly animatronics' start attacking him because they want Abby. He is then saved by Vanessa (she got Gyatt) and she bandages him up. Then we learn that William Acton if flipping Vanessa's father, this makes no sense with the lore he should be mikes father. Then we get the final fight as Mike and Venessa go to save Abby, they fight their way through the animatronics with tasers and cattle rods. They finally rescue Abby but guess who's there, William Afton, he has a mid intro then Abby does a flipping drawing telling Freddy and the gang that the yellow rabbit (Afton) is evil. They turn on him and the cupcake from chica causes the spring locks to fail. However this man just goes 'ahh', what the freek you have just been impelled with multiple metal rods with the thickness of my duck. In the lore he doesn't scream due to his vocal cords being ducked by the metal rods going into him however in the movie he does not have his helmet on but he just groans. During this he says the line 'I always come back' but it is the worst line delivery ever, it is way too rushed. Finally the animatronics drag him away and it cuts to a hospital scene. Mid scene it sets up the next movie. But the post credit scene is what we want, but it's terrible . Afton (now springtrap) points at a ghosts child, that's it. This would have been the perfect time for the 'I always come back' but no. Overall my disappointment is immeasurable, I have waited 8 years for this film, I could have wrote and directed a 100 times better film than this. It gets a 4/10, it has the odd okay scene but it's gets most of its points from the guys in front of us who were like Johnny Young but funny. Frick you Emma Tammi (the director).",2023-10-25
"This movie was terrible, there were plot holes all over the place, characters that weren't even supposed to be introduced yet. Over all just ruined my childhood. Vanessa is a character that doesn't come into the fnaf scene until the tail end of the lore and games. Overall her character was confusing and didn't add much to the story? Very frustrating. As for the animatronics I don't understand why spring trap was the only character designed with the classic black eyes we all see in the games. Yes people say red eyes are canon but in the games, these characters are scary because of their eyes and the overall concept. There were so many things included or just not included in the movie lore wise. Honestly, I wasted my time.",2023-11-02
"I'm an OG fan and been waiting for this movie for YEARS, and it's way better than i expected. Things went like this: the movie released, people watched it and said it was a disappointment, i lost hope - but then i watched it, WAY BETTER than i expected.People say it's not accurate to the lore, but can they really understand that it's really difficult to put up a summary to fit into a movie of lore that is not even official? Barely even scott knows the lore👻 and people saying it was too cringy and in a degree i agree, but it wasn't too bad.I feel like people tend to base their reviews on how the movie is made and think about the littlest details, which prevents them from basing the review on how they actually like the movie. I'm quite interested on details, but i couldn't help but love this movie. I honestly think blumhouse did a great job, not to mention scott's progress on the whole bunch of games and this movie.",2023-10-27
"The movie was just so disappointing, the creators promised a lore accurate movie with a lot of jumpscares. There were some lore accurate parts, but mostly it was just messed up and random stuff was added. Like for everyone who knows the games and story, it's frustrating. Like the story of the movie was patched up from different games, but I think it was supposed to be like the first part. The movie wasn't scary at all, almost no jumpscares. Everything that was scary in the game was just taken away. The whole vibe, music and sounds. It was just a generic horror movie, very predictable. The movie overall wasn't very good, even for people who don't know the story and for the fans who have waited for a long time, it's just disappointing.",2023-10-26
I'm a cinema member and watch all the movies as it's a hobby of mine. Seeing this advertise I was really looking forward to it. I can honestly say it's one of the worst movies I've seen on cinema nothing how I imagined it would be. About kids disappearing and not much action very depressing story line. I know there's a game about this which my son loves and told me all about it I can tell you guys if you know the story from the game this movies nothing like that. The whole movie keeps going back to a dream of where his brother has been kidnapped and him chasing some kids asking what happened to his brother really boring.,2023-10-25
"For what I was expecting this movie really missed the ball. If the target audience would've been more for late teens-adult like the video game it could have been a great horror film, instead it was a very clean, kind of family friendly (except some gory parts) scary movie. The story line was kind of stupid and hard to follow at times. There is a lingering question throughout that never gets answered, and characters that never get closure in the story. The movie moved very slow but when there was action it was good action. A couple of good jump scares. Just didn't live up to my expectations when compared to the VR video game.",2023-10-30
"I've been waiting for this movie to come out since the sixth grade, when they announced it. Did it live up to expectations, well sort of. It had its epic and fun moments, such as the opening scene where the intro was done in pixel art like in minigames, hoe the set was built and the entire pizzeria complex, animatronics, YouTuber cameos, fnaf song in the credits... details that met the expectations of fans. Also, for the first time, a complete story was put together, to explain a bit of the lore of the game franchise, which is a big plus for this film, but somehow the story didn't go deep enough. It could've been more building up and raising the intense of the story, until the final act.As for the final battle, it was good, but somewhat disappointing. Instead of it being the main act, which in my opinion should have lasted much longer, they cut it as if it was irrelevant. Wasn't Afton supposed to destroy all the animatronics with the ax and be scared to death by the unleashed ghosts of children to bring him to his doom. Likewise, in the game in the seventh night, the night guard was fired because of the damage caused in the restaurant. Also, Freddy, who is the main star of this film, has barely 2 minutes of screentime. CUPCAKE, who is the most pathetic animatronic in games, dominated more than him. But Foxy was the GOAT, there's no arguing about that. In my opinion, the film as a whole is ok, but it could have been done a lot better, that's why I was a little disappointed. And why didn't Markiplayer appeared. Also, the jumpschers in this film are generally not scary, except for BallonBoy, who is just a toy.",2023-10-28
"In no way was this a good film, other than maybe being fun to watch. The horror is bad, the animatronics don't fit live action, etc. There was maybe seven jump scares in the movie and three of them were fake-outs with a small balloon boy figurine. The horror just doesn't work, you can see how hard they tried but failed with that aspect. Also, it was trying to be fun and comedic for about ten minutes in the middle for some reason. I have no idea why they would do that. This movie seems to just be a thing for fan service and nothing more, and they barely got that right! The only good fan service was when CoryxKenshin and MatPat were on screen. Everything else was just bad. Not to mention the odd subplot of the main character's aunt trying to steal his sister and going to absurd lengths to do that, like hiring people to break into an abandoned restaurant while he's not there to make him look bad on paper! And that part barely even get referenced for the rest part of the movie, except for one scene where the aunt comes back and gets killed in the same scene. I could go on and on about this, but all I'll say is don't watch it.",2023-10-28
"Despite the eight-year wait and the terrible theater etiquette that ruined the night, this film failed to deliver a MATURE story that has been long-anticipated by fansThe game's audience is more focused on the actual murders and animatronics, so why do we spend the entire film following a lethargic man and his sister? He wasn't even interesting; all he did throughout the film was beat a man half to death and sleep. The real disappointment is that Mike was overshadowed by the actual pizzeria, as in the location itself, not the history behind it, but simply seeing the actual location had more personality than Mike.My favorite part of the entire film was when they forgot Springtrap was the antagonist, so they threw him into the end to say ""I always come back"" and springtrapped all over Freddy!",2023-11-01
"First of all, it was okay. It is watchable. But as a fan, I am honestly disappointed. I grew up on the games and my childhood is based on fnaf. Honestly, I know the film is based on the books, and yes I didn't read them. I know that Scott said the books are canon as well as the games, but the fanbase grew up on THE GAMES NOT THE BOOKS. I just don't get why they didn't made the film based on the lore of the games, I am sure if they had done it, every fan would have enjoyed the film.Basically this film is about Mike whose little brother was kidnapped and he couldn't get over it. He lives with his young sister who can speak with ghosts. He gets the security job and meets Vanessa. Vanessa is strange but kind. A babysitter was looking after Abby, while Mike is at work. Mike had a fight before and his aunt wants to take Abby from her because she finds him irresponsible. So the anomatronics want Abby to become like them, and Mike wants to know who killed his brother. The ghost children told Mike they will give him his brother but he has to do anything they want. Mike said yes but after he regretted it and the anomatronics got mad. Soon William appeared in spring bonnie custome, and Abby showed the anomatronics that he is their killer. Also before it, Vanessa tells Mike that his father, William Afton is the killer. William stabs her. So after Abby shows the anomatronics the truth, they got mad and the springlock failure happens. At the end, Vanessa is in the hospital.All in all, this movie was disappointing for a fan, I would recommend this, just because the actors were great and the anomatronics were cool. But the plot wasn't as great as I wished)):",2023-10-28
"The movie was amazing in my opinion, loved how it was pulled along and it told the story well. Everyone who knows the story lore knows it wasnt a disappointment, now with that being said i know other people moght not like or understand it as well IF and its a big if, they dont really understand the plot of the lore or anything in general. But overall i really enjoyed the movie and loved everything about it, nothing made me hate or dislike the movie in the slightest. Really hope we get another fnaf movie n the coming years. Beautiful piece of work this movie was, honestly. Cant wait to see what scott has in store for us next.",2023-10-28
"Let me start this out by saying a few things I did enjoy. They did such an amazing job on the cast, especially Vanessa and Mike. I loved the YouTuber cameos more than anything, and I give the set design a solid 10/10. On a less positive note, I consider this the biggest let down of the year. Me and many other fans waited for years for this film, and it's so insanely upsetting at how the team managed to fail this bad. I understand it wasn't going to be directly from the first game, but making it based on books was rediculus. It was awfully cringe at times and they got lousy on the gore. This ruins all perception of the lore and it's super sad I waited so long for trash.",2023-10-29
"I have been a Five Nights at Freddy's fan for a really long time and when I learned that there will be a movie I just couldn't wait for it to come. But when I finally saw it today, I thought 'Wow! What a disaster!'Firstly, FNAF has a really interesting and deep lore, in this movie however, the main points of the plot were absent and everything else was mixed up (like what was Vanessa doing there?? Why was William Afton her father??) and felt really rushed. Also FNAF is a tragic story, but somehow there was a happy ending in the movie for everyone? Just why?? Not everything has to have a happy ending.Secondly, I, personally, wanted this movie to be scary, which could've been achieved even with PG-13 rating, but animatronics didn't seem creppy or unsettling at all, like they should have. On the contrary, they looked very sweet and friendly.To conclude I would like to say that this movie was a big waste of time and I recommend watching some letsplays on youtube, they are much better than this cinematic rubbish.",2023-10-27
"By far one of the best video games adaptations. This movie combines a lot of the parts from the first 3 games in the franchise and dives deep into the lore. The animatronics being 100% practical really gives this film a grounded feel compared to a lot of other recent films that use poorly rendered CGI . The plot plays out very well for the most part and is mostly true to the games with slight differences as this movie is not canon to the game franchise. There were only a few instances where the A and B plots do get a little crowded, and a longer run time could have been very helpful to get all the points across. For the most part, the A plot is solid, Mike (main protagonist) takes up the job at the pizzeria being the security guard. Where the movie starts to diverge is that Mike has these dreams every night where he sees his little brother gets taken away 10-15 years ago. When Mike is at the pizzeria, the ghost children that possess the animatronics start to appear in his dreams. This freaks him about a bit but at the same time it's one of the reasons that pulls him back to the pizzeria. The other reason is to make enough money to support his little sister Abbey, which the animatronics are fond of after Mike takes her there when he can't get ahold of the babysitter. At this point of the movie, the children in mikes dreams make a bargain to help find the man that took his brother, for anything they want. They change his dreams to where he is with his brother and parents eating a meal happily together which never got to happen. The children ask for abbey in return for this which is the catalyst on why they are hostile to Mike near the end of the film since he does not want to give her up.The B plot of this film is the poorest part of this film as It never does have a resolution or feel like it fits into the story. It's like a trying to shove a puzzle piece into the wrong puzzle. Mikes aunt wants to take custody of Abbey to win a settlement claim. The babysitter is in on this for some reason, and the aunt tells her and her pursummed boyfriend to go raid Freddy's and trash it so Mike can get fired and be without a job. They do so but get killed by the animatronics, and then that's it. The aunt appears later in the film to babysit for abbey while mike goes back to work but the gang is never brought back up in dialogue from the aunt. It all feels out of place and she isn't seen again in the film.This movie had some really great highs, and is for any fan of the series. The only complaints I have is the B plot and that this movie may seem a little off for any newcomers of the series. The games are 100% meant to be played before watching this amazing movie.",2023-10-27
"This was worth 8 years of waiting. This movie is definitely for the fans to enjoy.I have been a FNAF fan ever since Pizzeria Simulator. This movie follows some of the games lore. Scott and Blumhouse worked really hard on this movie and it was awesome. Scott and Blumhouse deserve a pat on the back for working on something big like this. However, it does have its issues.This movie really adapts so much to my childhood memories and to the day when I first became obsessed with the series. Mathew Lillard was just fantastic as William Afton in this movie after seeing how he did in the scream movies. And Jim Henson did a really good job creating Freddy and the gang making them so real and as cute as they are. This movie has so much to what it has to offer, and I know FNAF fans like myself will enjoy something like this. Critics have just never played the games and never understood the games lore like us fans do. Overall, this movie is technically made only for the fans to enjoy because they would understand the story more often to the people who was never into FNAF.But as an OG FNAF fan this movie is an 8/10, Thank you Scott for everything that you have made for us. This movie is really worth watching and I would see this again.",2023-10-28
"I recently watched this film with my 8-year-old, who is slightly younger than its intended audience. While the movie echoes well-loved gateway horror films like NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS and BEETLEJUICE, it sets itself apart with a layer of classic horror intensity, making it more visceral than its counterparts.Crafted with a younger audience in mind, the film presents a story that's squeamish, inventive, and morally nuanced. It might appeal more to younger viewers, but adults might find it a tad niche.What sets it apart is its emphasis on story over mere jump scares. The film blends psychological horror with creatively unsettling animatronic kills.While certain scenes push the envelope, the film's inclination to tackle darker themes is evident. Even when the animatronics enact gruesome deaths, there's an underlying sense that the victims, given their own dubious moral standings, arguably had it coming.In its execution, the movie steers clear of clichés. Taking a page from WORLD WAR Z, it proves that effective horror isn't solely about gore. The performances are robust, the characters are fleshed out, and despite a somewhat intricate plot, it remains accessible.While familiarity with the game that inspired the movie can add layers to the viewing experience, it's by no means a prerequisite. The film stands firmly on its own, offering closure yet hinting at the possibility of sequels.The exemplary quality of the animatronics underscores the significant effort and budget allocated to the production. This film doesn't just cater to a younger audience; it redefines horror for them, an approach I find commendable.For adults seeking traditional horror thrills, this might fall short. Yet, it carves a promising path for youth-focused horror films. It captivated my child, and that's a resounding success in my view.",2023-10-28
"At first, I was a little worried that this movie was going to be treated like a cheep horror flick. But the movie played out much like one of Scott Cawthons books. The aesthetic was exactly what I imagined the books to be and I was so delighted to see that in the movie. I was also surprised and super happy about how we explored the animatronics childish side. That was always something in the fandom that I liked seeing. I never saw it in the actual games. But this just showed how well these people knew their fans!! Also the soundtrack was pretty flippin awesome! The main theme was perfect for the franchise. I also really loved what they did with the end credits. I also loved the teaser for Fnaf 2 at the end with the minigame voice. I loved the casting for this movie. I also also loved the animatronics. They looked way too perfect!! The restaurant too!! Also also also, I loved the cameos from YouTubers in the movie. There was also a reference to the dream theory in the movie. That made me chuckle. I also also also ALSO loved how the movie can stand as its own thing. It was all so perfectly wrapped up so that I could just show anyone the movie and they'd know what the franchise is like. Scott and the rest of the team did above and beyond for this movie. I can confidently say that this is my new favorite horror movie by a long shot!!",2023-10-27
"Before watching this movie I already knew most of the fnaf lore and its one of the reasons I was so excited to watch it. Sadly the only thing that was true to the story was some of the names and springtraps death even then they made him Vanessa's dad not michels. The animatronics look fantastic as to whats expected of Jim Hensons team but the atmosphere of constant tension in an attempt to make it ""scarier "" fails miserably as every jumps scare is expected and the only time I really was jumpscared was by a door. Although it's really hard to cast good kid actors because let's be honest it's children they had to be the most awful I've seen in a while (it also had to do with the script they were given). Abby felt very forced and making her obsessed with giant animatronics to the point where she still calls them friends after they almost murdered her brother leans more towards psychotic than nice. The other kids had no real dialogue and they were just added to make it scarier?.The aunt serves no real purpose other than comedic relief and we're left assuming she's dead. Michels character is very shallow with his only motive to live is to ""find his brother"" but its fine because that changes to ""protect sister"" later on, I'm not expecting the characters of a horror movie to serve much purpose other than survival but how do you make a 2 hour movie based on the younger brother missing only to end with ""wow now I know the true meaning of life!"". 4/10 because of the puppets and mat pat cameo other than that it was a terrible movie.",2023-10-27
"This film is exactly what the title describes. It is by no means perfect whatsoever and those who aren't aware of the games will not appreciate it as much as those who are aware. The film in itself regardless of the game is fine, I thought actors were a solid fit especially Josh Hutcherson. Matthew Lillard also done fine with the script and minimal screen time he got. Elizabeth Lail put in a good performance. All in all it was a fun film about a desperate man who takes on a job at an abandoned kids pizzeria inhabited by animatronic animals who have a supernatural vibe. Lead actor delves deeper into his little brothers disappearance and gets closer to resolving it the longer it goes on.Not a must watch but certainly enjoyable.",2023-10-29
"This movie is fan-service. It most certainly does not work as a standalone. I have played the first and second Five Nights at Freddy's games, and this did not tickle my fancy. If you were alive and cognizant when the first game came out, it's going to be a bad experience.The character, Vanessa, is shoved into the plot like a rubber ducky in a tunnel-- it's easy, it's quick, and it doesn't make any sense. The character is there for exposition and a vague romantic interest.On the flipside, Hutcherson's character was amazing. Great storytelling: well acted, and well written. He has his moments of falter though, like ***SPOILERS from here on*** when he says ""ghost children controlling animatronics"" or something like that-- probably a misquote. Absolutely abhorrent moment in the movie.Lastly, I didn't love the idea of trying to get back into his dream to find his brother's abductor, but I can get behind it, it's a horror movie after all.",2023-10-28
"A tour de force for FNAF fans. This movie, though it had its flaws, was a stellar piece of horror fiction, and the best way to give fan service to the community of Freddy's. From the AMAZING job done by Jim Hensons Creature Shop of animatronics, to the special effects and horrific jump scares, this movie had it all that we wanted (though more gore would've been nice, it was still amazing.) as a long time fan, I must say, Scott, you have done us proud. 8 years of work and waiting has all been worth it in the end. Of course though, not every movie is perfect and this one was certainly anything but. For fans of the series, we're already accustomed to convoluted and messy plots, and this film followed that pattern. The plot seemed to be on a very rocky, rickety and old train track. While on point, it was very rocky. The acting of Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lillard for sure made up for it though. The one other gripe is the pace. It was incredibly fast, even for me, and that's saying something. Im hoping they take more time to draw the absolutely ENORMOUS plot of FNAF out more so we can better understand it and get a good grasp of what's actually going on, because I left the theater feeling bad for the non-fans of the series. They probably have no idea what's going on or what just happened. All in all, the film was amazing, and I will for sure be watching it numerous times over. If you have a chance to watch it, go do it!!! And see it in GTX!!!",2023-10-28
"Fingers away from this one, tapping the table with my 10 fingers , i might as well stomp my hand and feet, for each slipped opportunity this film has given away..., but most of all, who is the main target group audience for this kinda consept???It cannot be the really seasone and wellgrilled horror enthusiasts, because its to easy on the gore, and its far too childish in its spirits for a grown up audience to like as a thriller /horror feature film...it is more a flashback memories staged story drama, played out in the darkness of night, small secluded secrets are thrown outta the darkness here and then, and a kinda strange lovestory appears about the good old days/lays at the amusement park/ tivoli/ spanish city( aka whitley bay, newcastle upon tyne) that brings back all the sorrows and bad memories from the past... and i still ask who is the target group of this movie.Im impressed by the cinematographic visuals thats not hidden in the dark, the set decor, and the animatronix (its easy to con a grumpy old man) the rest though is fairly generic and reimburse old fatigued ideas from the silverscreen past.Still wondering whos the target audience, the grumpy old man found not much satisfaction, cause its too long and at the same time too slow , it might be scary to some, just not me...this time.just a small recommend.",2023-10-27
"Given Blumhouse's success with M3GAN earlier this year, I assumed they would strike a similar tone with this animatronic horror film. It's kind of crazy how rapidly this film will shift from depressing child murder drama to a happy-go-lucky fever dream. It doesn't strike that in-on-the-joke tone that M3GAN excelled at. While I think there should be some darker horror elements, far too infrequently does the film revel in the goofy camp of its premise. The dead kid stuff is just not very original and not very well executed. Add in being incredibly predictable with paper thin characters too.This film also drags on far too long. You could easily cut 25 minutes and nothing would change. The story beats get hammered over and over with some honestly poor resolution. Five Nights at Freddy's is a big miss from a reasonably reliable studio.",2023-11-02
"My kids and I decided to have a stay-at-home Halloween party last night, and we streamed the latest thrill from Blumhouse. The best part of the evening was listening to my kids moan and groan about how boring the movie was, and kids don't lie. I personally struggled to stay awake throughout the majority of the film, and while I was watching the amazing cast of characters trying to get through the plot holes that Freddy's had to offer, I was wondering if the folks at Blumhouse were intentionally releasing films that had no rewatch value. Last year, ""Halloween Ends"" was a misstep for the brand, and ""The Exorcist: Believer"" was another good idea gone Green. Granted, the best parts of the film were happening when the gang was playing their musical instruments and dancing around the restaurant, although moments like that only lasted so long. My kids are 8 and 3, and by the time the end credits started rolling, they had begged me to shut down the program. Needless to say, it was an interesting evening. Personally, I'm giving the film 5 stars for the effects, the cast, and the music. I wish Uwe Boll would have made this film, He would have made it better.",2023-11-01
"Everything that needed to be on screen was already established in game. They strayed so far from core concepts that made the game spooky that this feels more like a kid-friendly fan-fiction than an edition to the expanded universe. Feels like a re-telling of the first game, but with events out of order, irrelevant, or otherwise contradicting what 9 years of FNAF lore has already established.The visuals in this movie and absolutely astonishing, capturing the theme, character design, and most importantly Freddy and the gang. The pizzeria was well done and had very fine details, down to the security setup.The painful plot seemed to be misguided at times, focusing on the parts that take away from Freddy entirely and focus heavily on developing a somewhat unlikable set of main characters. It's incredible that for a movie and game franchise called Five Nights at Freddy's, the actual amount of Freddy and his impact is wildly under used and instead he is constantly upstaged by a cupcake.I love this franchise's game and lore. This movie didn't just fail to impress me, it disappointed me for what could have been an amazing cinematic adventure for the future of this franchise.",2023-10-28
"The original Five Nights at Freddy's game (which this film is largely based off of) was a super simple but surprisingly innovative game about a security guard in an abandoned Chuck E Cheese style pizzeria hiding from the animatronics while trying to make it to the end of their shift. There were hints given about the overall arc of the story but they were doled out slowly and a lot of it came in after-the-fact. We focus on Mike and his tireless pursuit of his missing brother Garrett while he simultaneously looks after his sister Abby. You would think a movie about killer animatronics would be fast-paced but in a different tactic, Five Nights is content to slow things down for most of the run time. It wants to setup the mystery surround Freddy Fazbear's and Garrett's abduction which is a choice but it's an odd one. There's something to be said for fleshing out the characters but I was certainly expecting something a little more visceral. The rest of the movie is geared toward the fanbase and if you're a fan, you know the story so all the buildup seems a little redundant if you already know what's going to happen.Casting Josh Hutcherson in the lead was an interesting pick. Hutcherson is in his early 30s but he looks like he's in his early 20s. To be fair, the games don't go into Michael's appearance a ton so it's not like Josh is cast against type. Hutcherson is giving it his all in this and I thought he succeeded as much as he could as Mike. He's appropriately frantic when called upon and he's fine acting beside Piper Rubio and Elizabeth Lail. Matthew Lillard was a pleasant surprise as Steve Raglan, he's appropriately campy and he got a few solid laughs out of me as the career counsellor. Piper Rubio was alright but I thought her performance was a little uneven, I had a hard time understanding where her character was at mentally because how affected she was didn't seem consistent from scene to scene. Abby was also a hard character to portray however. I really liked Elizabeth Lail in some of her previous work (mainly the 1st season of You) and while I don't think she was bad, she's kind of brought down by her character. Vanessa is really wishy-washy in this and she's all over the place emotionally. I just didn't see the same kind of spark from Elizabeth in Five Nights. The cast was mostly passable as a whole but while I don't like singling out one member, I was taken aback by how off pitch Mary Stuart Masterson was as Aunt Jane. While Lillard's work was more playful, she was unintentionally comedic and her bluntness didn't have the desired effect that I think Five Nights was going for.As much as Five Nights has a ton of moments for the fans between the small nods in the set dressing, in-jokes in the dialogue and it brings in many of the fan-favourite characters, it still doesn't accomplish the most basic thing it needs to do. There's barely anything unsettling in this version of Five Nights let alone anything scary. The movie feels neutered to cater to its target audience. I understand that making it a conventional R rated slasher was never going to be in the cards but any violent deaths or maiming is done off-screen and it just sucks away any possible tension or thrills. To me it made the movie come off as accidentally goofy, the mythology of this series of games is surprisingly dark and relying on jump scares so frequently or choosing ""simulated horror"" over showing anything that could have possibly raised your pulse paints the original material in an unflattering light.I wouldn't describe myself as a Freddy's fan but I do know a fair amount of the larger story of the franchise and I respect how much work went into creating the phenomenon that the Five Nights at Freddy's morphed into. The early games were basic and even cheap when it came to the scares but people gravitated toward them in droves and I think there was a lot of vision in how the series unfolded. This movie will give the die-hard members of the community what they want (this was evident in my theatre where a large percentage of the audience was cheering and clapping when the film ended) and Emma Tammi and her team (including Scott Cawthon and the writers) deserve credit for clearly prioritizing/caring about the fans and pleasing them first. But I can only imagine this will entertain those fans and few others, they needed to push the envelope a little at least but Five Nights is too safe and too contemplative for anyone interested in a legitimate horror movie. I have to think this will get a sequel and colour me interested if they try to go a different direction in the next chapter. If you're a fan, I think you should check this out but expectations should be kept low. If you've missed the hype train to this point and are only coming to this now, this version of Freddy's isn't going to win you over, you can skip it.",2023-11-01
"Five Nights At Freddy's is really a movie you could get your kids into horror with. For real.It's so tame.It's not bad, but GDI! I wanted a ton of blood.Seriously... if you want a great movie about murderous animatronics, watch ""The Banana Splits Movie"" or ""Willy's Wonderland""Five Nights and Freddy's was a HUGE let down being a big fan of the games.This movie like many movies based on a game really just didn't understand it's audience and dropped the ball so hard it was insulting.There were ZERO (I repeat) ZERO jump scares! THAT WAS LITERALLY WHAT THE GAME WAS ABOUT!No blood. Some odd story line that really didn't make much sense, and really no reason to make this. It really seemed to me like they just used the name to gain sales without any care about what that might mean.4 stars because kids might like it.1 star is really what I want to give this.BOOOOOOO!*throws rotten tomato*",2023-10-27
"Honestly, I did know somewhat a bit about the FNAF game before I saw the movie, going in I didnt expect much because obviously it is made after a game, thus its hard to tell if its going to be good. The atmosphere in my cinema was rowdy, half of the people going to see the film because of the game and the other half as a joke. The film overall had a weak plot, the acting was abismal and it was a hard watch without some jokes in between. That said though, the graphics were great and it will please those who are fans of the game, there are some special apperances and im sure that long fans of the film will appreciate it. My main takeaways are really:
1. Definitely watch if you are a big fan of FNAF, there are special appearances and it will fill you with interesting content
2. If you dont know anything about FNAF, DONT GO! If you want to see a good movie go to Killers of the Flower Moon instead, unless you enjoy sub par horror (which wasnt all too scary) I wouldnt go!That said, if you enjoy fnaf then eat your heart out with this one.",2023-10-25

"There is only one big talent in this movie and thats the little girl, Piper Rubio. Well played and believable. Thats the best cast.Josh Hutcherson have done good movies but this was just below what he should have said yes to. But bills to pay maybe and thats fair. But movies like this can ruin all chances to get into better movies.Special effects where comical but I did enjoy the 80s theme that made the mechanical dolls more realistic.Story line is awful but better than most 1 star horror movies.It was a bit too easy with storyline and just the writing wasnt very strong at all.The visual theme or look of the movie was nice and exciting. The cinematography nice but a bit too classical which I believe they where going for.Every time you put Josh Hutcherson in a movie you just know where its going. He is so type casted that even a lead role like scream movie, you knew where it was going. He really didnt pull it off well in the end of the movie and the writing for the character ruined his good performance as the job-offering guy.. You always know why he is in a movie and thus very early this was ruined by the sterotypical teen-horror casting.It did entertain but also far fetched story. The dream-like connection between real life and dreams was a nice touch and made it somewhat more believable but not scary but more just horror-ish.I have to mention Elizabeth Lail as she did very well in the beginning of playing a bit off-character person that has secrets and is mysterious but also a victim, Well done too.I wouldnt recommend the movie as there are far better things to watch in a short life - but if you are fan of any of the main characters then it can be entertaining. And if you havent watched horror movies from the 90s and 00' then you wont realize the plot too early. This has a bit of copy paste to it though.Enjoy.",2023-10-28

"Some movies we watch, they're so bad I'm not even sure I should review them at all. ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" (2023) falls into that unfortunate category. Despite entering with an open mind and low expectations, disappointment was the overwhelming takeaway. The film fails to capture the eerie ambiance and subtle dread that the original games were known for. Instead, it leans heavily on lackluster jump scares, which often feel forced and predictable. None of the characters manage to garner any sympathy; the child protagonist comes across as grating and insufferable, while the cameos feel cringeworthy and unconvincingly delivered.Moreover, the plot unfolds at a plodding pace, with a glaring absence of genuine frights for the better part of its duration. Disappointingly, the narrative seldom centers around the crucial element of surviving five nights amid the menacing animatronics. When horror elements do emerge, they either fall flat or are left to the imagination. This was evidenced by the audience's composed demeanor, mainly composed of adolescents aged 13-15, who failed to exhibit any signs of genuine fright. It's apparent that the movie underwent substantial rewrites to shoehorn the FNAF theme, resulting in a disjointed narrative. While the animatronics themselves boast impressive visual design, their movements often betray the illusion, resembling humans in furry costumes. The sole silver lining in this otherwise lackluster film lies in Matthew Lillard's commendable performance, providing a glimmer of quality amidst the disappointment.",2023-10-28
"I've always been and will be a huge fan of Five Nights at Freddy's. I was there when Scott Cawthon releases the firsts games and I perfectly remember that has given me lots of good times. And, finally, fnaf can be related with my favorite thing, the movies.I saw this movie with two sides: the fnaf fan side and the cinephile side. Beginning with the fan side, I can say that this movie gave a good time, no wonder, because the movie was full of fan service, like the voice of the fnaf 2 game in the credits or like the springtrap reveal. And I can tell a lot of fan service in this movie but, it's just that, fan service. And you can tell me ""please, it's just an adaptation of a video-game, obviously couldn't be perfect"". And I say to you ¿Arcane is not an almost perfect adaptation of a video-game? And here is when my cinephile side gets in. The fnaf movie has a lot of script holes and deus ex machina. Reading other reviews, I saw that this movie don't seem to have any fixed course, and I agree with that. But, leaving this aside. There was lot of script holes that got me a lil bit mad, like the fact that Mike didn't know about the missed kids of the restaurant, and I think ¿why he didn't know such a thing? Come on, he has a missing brother and he is practically all days looking for him and the man who kidnapped him, for God sakes. Or ¿what is that of disable the animatronics just using a taser? So why the guards in the firsts three games didn't use tasers instead of put on masks, closing mechanic doors and use flashlights. And the most important thing, the reveal of William Afton, the climax of the movie, it was a lil bit disappointing. I think that is because I expected something like the famous scream of William when he is brutally killed by the spring suit. But I personally think they don't put something like that because it could be ""very bizarre"" but, come on, it supouse to be a scary movie isn't it.In conclusion, this movie can give you a good time if you are a mild fan of fnaf. It can give a good time with some disappointing parts if you are a huge fan of the saga. And it can leave a lot to be desired if you are a cinephile like me. Definitely, the fan-made footages are a lot way better.",2023-10-27
"I was so excited to see this movie because I loved this game in high school. I still love it. But not only is this not at all like the game, but it just wasn't good in general. The beginning is slow. The acting isn't that great. The plot pretty much took away everything thag makes the game enjoyable, which is a comical night of the museum ish story with jump scares. This was a horror story that I couldn't take seriously, and instead of entertaining me it just disturbed me. Another said part of this is that it I'm supposed to take a lot of the conflicts in this movie seriously, but I can't because the conflicts aren't realistic and the acting isn't good.",2023-10-28
"The movie was great at introducing new characters and connecting relationships between them. The first part of the movie was great, the main character was explained and introduced at very high phase while still bieng easily understandable. After that it went downhill, if you are a hard-core/or a fan who knows the lore more or less you will be heavily disappointed with the characters and with the baseline story overall.Main character is Mike Schmidt, and his sister Aby Schmidt.Yes nothing makes sense, wait there's more
William afton is there, but he has a older then Mike daughter Vanessa Afton...
Vanessa was not introduced until Security Breach, what the f?They stated that in every shoot Scott was heavily involved and the movie and its story is take care of but not rl.Anyway great movie but if you are a fnaf fan be prepared for less.",2023-10-29
"The games had a perfect movie adaptation especially since theres so many missing parts from the games that need to be filled in. Mike accidentally killing his brother with fredbear is a much better plot and already connects him to the pizzeria without abby having to have the spirits in her head, or Vanessa filling in the plot. The plot couldve unraveled naturally showing both williams motive for killing the kids and shows mikes guilt at the same time. I have to assume they went the direction they did because of budget restrictions but honestly if that was the case, a film completely in the pizzeria with way more jumpscares wouldve been just fine. Also nothing about this film is scary and the pizzeria looked like it costed afton a million dollars, in the games they were always cheap buildings. All this film proves is scott truly has been ""winging it"" the whole time.",2023-10-27
"I came out of the movie theater so fuming I had to take my medication to calm me down after watching this gross mischaracterization of a franchise I loved as a child. I hope one day we discover mind reading technology so I can find out what was going through Scott Cawthon's head when he decided to direct this garbage adaption of his once beloved games and completely twist around his several years of writing. They completely switched around the lore to the point of it being nonsensical. They completely erased the characters of Chris and Elizabeth, they made Michael a random brother of one of Afton's victims. They made Afton still alive even though he would've been dead far before this movie had taken place. They made Vanessa William's daughter despite the fact she is a character who took place in the future in the original lore, long after Afton's death. The entire movie felt like I was watching a tasteless reboot of an old cartoon I once enjoyed, I now understand why so many people hated Teen Titans Go after seeing this gross rehatching of a game franchise I enjoyed for many years. A waste of the ticket cost and Ubers to get to the theater. The only things I enjoyed about the movie were the callbacks to the original lore and the pizza the movie theater served. One of the things that made me the most angry was the way they teased the original fans of the franchise by adding little hints making people think they'd somehow circle back to the original lore, like almost purposefully avoiding to say Michael's last name, only for it to amount to nothing.",2023-10-27
"I don't know what made the story so weak
On the other hand, connecting Vanessa with William Afton was completely out of the main dimension of the story.Even the jump scares could have been much scarier, especially Foxy. Instead of just walking, jumping or jumping would definitely be much better The only strong point for me was the interesting appearance of William Afton in Golden Freddy.I was expecting five nights of real fear like his game, but it was not scary at all. More work was done on the criminal style of the story and no attention was paid to its horror.Frustrating.Again, we saw the repetition of abuse of popular game franchises.",2023-10-30
"This is the first time I am actually writing a bad review for a movie. I don't usually do this since I respect the effort required by so many individuals to create a feature film. But for this movie, I felt cheated on - I spent 13 euros on sitting through the most boring and soulless piece of media in existence.I went into the movie with a friend of mine and we both expected a fun time. We both weren't new to the franchise and had fun playing the games as kids so I assumed that it we were part of the target audience. And I was so wrong.The plot is centered around a guy whose brother was kidnapped when he was younger. This tragic event led to him trying to find the kidnapper by attempting to recreate the scenery in his sleep. This attempt, however, leads to him spacing out often, being emotionally unstable and, thus, not being able to keep a job.At the same time, there is the conflict about him being responsible for his sister since his parents passed away. His aunt tries to gain custody of his sister as a result of his financial and emotional instability. Since the guy does not want his sister to be taken away from him, he accepts a job at Freddy Fazbears Pizzeria.While this plot is not that horrible, it is executed so poorly that I could not take any of it seriously after approximately 30 minutes. None of the characters' motivations are plausible: why would the main character who is in his mid twenties, struggles with his finances, has deep psychological problems and shows no sign of willingness to interact with his sister sacrifice everything to retain custody? Why would his aunt who also has no identifiable grudge against the main character and has no connection to her niece try to destroy his life in such an undiplomatic manner (for instance, she initiates a robbery of the pizzeria to make him loose his job, which is entirely unnecessary in the context of his already existing issues). There are NO likable characters in this movie which is completely insane. The ones that are (or at least seem to be) written to be likable are insufferable in most of the dialogues. The movie probably would have been better if the lines were cut by 50%.While the movie failed to deliver a good plot, it was still true to the lore of the games. The integration of the lore, however, felt akward and forced. Some characters even outright stated some lore knowledge which totally misses the point of why the underlying plot of the games worked so well: the beauty of the storytelling in the games laid in its subtility. If you didn't want to know anything about the story, you were not bombarded with lore.The fixation on the lore was made obvious through the appearance of matpat, a known overanalizer of small details regarding the Fnaf games. While the appearance was cute and I smiled when he showed up, it was ultimately pointless and it felt like this cameo (and the implementation of that's just a theory) did not fit into a universe that wants to take itself so serious.The acting severely suffered under the poor writing, that is all I can say about that. It is pretty hard to appreciate the acting of someone that plays the most poorly written and unlikable character that was exposed to the world in a long time.Then there is the horror aspect of the movie. Well, actually there isn't. I understand that it was meant to be appealing to a larger audience but scares were basically non-existent. All the animatronics that seemed so frightening in the games were more of a laughingstock and the atmosphere of the haunted diner was destroyed almost as soon as the main cast of the animatronics appeared.I didn't expect it to be a bloody gorefest (most of the horror in the games was already really stomachable in my opinion) but I still was severely disappointed by the lack of anything remotely scary.While I almost exclusively found the movie astoundingly horrible, most of the times, the lighting, shots, music and general setting were always good and beautiful at times. This does slightly bump the rating but to be honest, the technicalities were not enough to cover up the horrific writing - If you dress a turd up nicely, it will still smell bad.Ultimately, the movie seemed like it didn't know what to be. It certainly wasn't a horror movie, took itself to seriously to be a comedy and was to whacky and poorly written to be a drama.So who is the movie even made for? Apparently not for me, that is all I can say.If you can stomach bad writing, unlikable characters, plotholes and eat up everything that a franchise feeds you, you will be having a pretty good time. Especially because there is a lot to discover regarding Easter eggs. If you are not familiar with the franchise or have standards when it comes to the quality of the media you consume, don't even bother. It was so bad that you cannot even laugh at it.",2023-10-27
"I had high hopes for this movie because of the story established in this lore. The movie reached that expectation. Its not for everyone else. Its a fun to watch especially when the kid met those animatronics. Its sad to see that the critics dont side with the movie, i get it but its not that bad to watch. Its entertaining and a good time watch with the family since it was pg-13 to expand the audience for everyone to enjoy. The bad side is that the level of scariness was not met it was more drama than horror but diverting to those things makes this film impeccable. I have no words with the performances of the cast. Can't wait to have a sequel to this movie i hope it expand this movie for atleast 2 or 3 sequels to culminate the story as one. Guys check it out dont mid the critics if you want a film that has heart and emotions.",2023-10-27
"I want to start by saying that I am not a die hard fan of Freddys by any means. I dont know much about it besides animatronics come to life. So my review will be based off the movie itself and not the other stuff.This movie plays out exactly how you would think it would. Guy gets a security job at what looks to be an old arcade. Takes no time to see lights flickering and odd things happening. Its not until he brings his younger sister does he realize these animatronics are alive and they want his sister to make her into one of them.They want his sister. He protects her. There's a plot twist that anyone with a brain will see coming, and with that said I did love that twist.I feel like we've seen this before and that's such a common phrase because it is kind of difficult to come up with original ideas, but that was honestly my first thought. I felt like I seen this movie before.I would give this movie a 5 overall. I gave it a 6 simply because Matthew Lillard.",2023-10-27
"Controversial review. Very controversial review. But I loved it. I mean, loved it. First off the story/plot of the game on the big screen was amazing. Some of the kills were great (even though censored heavily but I mean hey, kids in the audience). As a FNAF veteran (Since the month the game CAME OUT); I enjoyed every minute of this, even though it may seem like ""typica horror schlock"" to the general audience. My only gripe was that COME ON BLUMHOUSE, you underused MATTHEW LILLARD??? That and some flaws in writing were the only issues I have but honestly, as a ""bad movie lover"", I bypassed them. Just so happy to see the animatronics going beyond the games, and also how perfect they look. The bro-sis chemistry between Josh and Piper was also great. Gonna enjoy this again VERY soon. Definitely BlumHouse's safest play for wanting kids to go see it. Concerning the general audience, I can understand not liking it for its flaws, but fans are definitely gonna love it. I loved it.",2023-10-27
"Honestly, I was unsure what to expect from this, but works so well in this is everything. It is truly a very well rounded offering.The set designs are superb, both respecting the source material and creating a very strong visual compliment to the storyline. Whatever technologies they used to generate the animatronic characters also impressed me with regards to honoring the original aesthetic and making them appear realistic.Where this movie also shines is through acting.Personally, I feel Hutcherson is underrated as an actor in general, but he is not the only one who stands out in this film. Most horror movies involve some difficult to sell dialogue because they rely predominantly on the fantastical to generate thrills. Five Night at Freddy's is no different in that regard; however, the entire cast effectively conveys the underlying emotions, as well as working gracefully through some requisite exposition.What I would consider to be the real defining trait of this movie was their success engaging the audience in the emotional components of the plot. While the poster and trailer might lead the unfamiliar to believe this is horror comedy, it hits very differently. Woven into terror, larger that life characters, and nostalgia are a lot of big feelings about loss, guilt, and navigating through pain. While not everyone may gaze that deeply into Five Nights at Freddy's, I give a lot of credit to the film's makers for creating a horror film that reaches beyond jump scares in order to deliver more.This is one movie that surprise by being a cut above.Definitely worth watching, probably more than once.",2023-10-28
"It started out pretty good, it had me hooked or so I thought. I was able to forgive some early plot holes in the movie, but they just kept coming. Don't get me wrong here this much more entertaining to watch than a mute Nicholas Cage in Willy's Wonderland but overall it still falls flat.It's like Toy Story meets Saw with poor writing. The humans in this movie said and did things that made their characters not believable as real people. Performances weren't even bad, which is impressive considering the actors did not have much to work with.Had the beginning been worse, I would have not been so disappointed with the finale.",2023-10-28
"Totally incredible... a movie made entirely for fans and non-fans.The story is well developed and there are no gaps in the script or conveniences that ruin the continuity of the film. As for the jumpscares, they are not bad, obviously there are but they are not ridiculous and they are well done, the same as with the 'gore'. The humor, as always, is objective but it is not childish at all and can make you at least smile in those scenes. The acting is quite good, as is the cast, everyone is well chosen and good work is evident from each actor. And the villain... is pure perfection, you can see his perverse way of being when he unmasks himself in front of the entire public and shows his true self.Like any movie based on a popular video game, there is fan service, but in this case I don't find it poorly placed or forced. On the contrary, every detail is well placed and has a meaning, even if it is something minimal.Finally, if you are a big fan of the saga, you will love it completely and you will leave the cinema satisfied. And if you're not, I'm sure you'll find it a decent horror movie.Thanks Blumhouse and Scott, it was worth waiting so many years. <3.",2023-10-27
"What's not to love? Josh Hutcherson invests the protagonist Mike with true heart, so that you actually care what happens to him and his little sister Abby. The story keeps you invested from the first frame. This movie is effectively creepy with just the right amount of dread, dark humor, and ghost story. Five Nights at Freddy's gets the animatronics right, seriously impressive! One of my pet peeves is when the movie screen gets so dark you can't really see what's going on but this film gets the darker scenes right by clearly displaying the fright. I appreciate that FNAF manages to appease its fan base whilst making itself appealing to us newbies. This is your perfect little Halloween thrill, so enjoy.",2023-10-28
"This review is coming from someone who has been a fan since the first few games and was incredibly hyped for this movie. I still had low expectations though, i knew it wouldn't be absolutely amazing but i hoped it would be at least six stars. The lore isn't very accurate to the original games. And of course, it's a movie adaption so it doesn't have to follow along as it can be something completely different from the source media. But if it was, it probably would've been much better. This movie sucks unless you want to get a few laughs from how bad it is or have some mindless entertainment. The costumes or whatever the animatronics are are really good. The acting isn't the best and every time you think you'd get to see someone's death, it cuts away. It does get points for the end credits song and all the other references to the original games. Not to mention the cameos. There are barely any jump scares in here- that work at least. Maybe i just didn't understand they were jump scares because of how bad they were. I thought i was going to be at least a little scared while watching this but it was pretty hilarious. I do hope the sequel that is clearly being set up by the ending is better. I hope the fnaf movie will be in its own universe that is separate from the games.",2023-10-29
"I was hoping FNAF would be good. It has a high audience score and fans of the games seem to love the movie. Well these ""fans"" must be 8 years old. The movie is boring. It is not scary. It is instead a convoluted mess that drags its feet until the final half hour. The whole premise of FNAF is being alone in the dark with jump scares. Perfect recipe for a modern horror flick. But instead the scenes are way too bright so nothing looks scary. And worse there is only 1 or 2 jump scares the entire movie. The animatronics do look good except the eyes. Again because the lighting is too bright, they machines look more like they are stoned than evil, killing what little horror there was and instead making it just look silly.The acting is pretty amateur, the exception being Matthew Lillard. However his scenes are so brief he doesn't save the movie. To make things worse, the dialogue is very wooden. I am told there are jokes in the movie but that's news to me as I didn't laugh once. The cop in particular is just awful. She is all over the place and I'm convinced she was told to play her character as someone suffering from bipolar or multiple personality disorder. One minute she's serious, the next she's all carefree, then she's emotional, then she's back to happy all in the span of 1 scene.The plot is all over the place. It tries to bring in too many things that most people will get confused or just disinterested. I think this movie would've been better if A) they stuck more to the lore and B) get rid of the little sister. Or don't make her as prominent a character and just live it as the security guard needs the money and he's the only one in the restaurant at night. Bringing the little sister in just ruined any horror and instead made the bulk of the movie some silly kids movie where they sing with animatronics and build a fort smh.Bottom line: if you're a little kid yeah you may like this. But most adults will find this movie boring and older fans will find it down right disappointing.",2023-10-30
"The five nights at Freddy's franchies is one of the most beloved and liked games Of all time and seeing the movie was such a Dream come true!The movie did NOT disappoint. The Animatronics are SPOT ON , the acting from josh Hutcherson is Very Fantastic not at all what i expected from him what a good acting!The story kinda shifts away from the games / the lore of the franchies and they and WITHOUT a Doubt Nailed it.The whole theme and vibe of this mvoie is eerie and very dark and terrifying even though this movie has a ton of jumpscares not 100% of the movie is scary actually it was subtle and it kinda plays tricks on you into thinking that it isn't a horror movie and just a pizzaria security footage or whatever.I like that there is just a lot to see when rewatching the movie and when this movie ends you just DON'T want to leave the world of Fazbear! Its so cleverly made with passion and love and so much care for the fans , and all the care and love turned so well and so great this movie is an absolute must watch for everyone that Loves the Five Night's at Freddy's World.But overall the movie took SO LONG and it was SO WORTH THE WAIT! The scenes are very AMAZING and just every shot is made carefully for the fans as they say it and THEY were not Lying!! That was such a gift from BlumHouse, and not just an ordinary gift , its a beloved one.",2023-10-26
"First of all, I just want to say this movie is great in several ways, and I just absolutely love it.Upon going into the cinema, I thought that this movie will only cover what happened in the first FNAF game (Yeah, the trailer had shown Springtrap, I know, but I didn't think he would show up until like, post-credits or something) Therefore, I'm honestly surprised they brought a few elements from the later games as well. I mean, I get it; who would want to watch the protagonist just pressing close-the-door buttons and looking at cameras everytime?I think that Mike's character is interesting, from the movie lore's point of view, because despite the direct reveal of him being Mike Schmidt, and not Mike Afton as theorised, I still think he is the latter person, and he is just under foster care. Maybe his backstory with his foster parents might connect later with William later in the franchise (if they are ever going to continue this) Who knows? Maybe I'm kidding myself, and MatPat will make a theory better than mine.Speaking of which, I'm thrilled when I saw MatPat and Cory on screen, like I couldn't believe it was happening. Though, it's a pity Markiplier, the King himself didn't make an appearance due to understandable reasons. Perhaps he will make one in the sequels, if there will be one.I also love what they do with the animatronics and the pizzeria. Even though the interior is mostly not like in the game, I appreciate the efforts and the details they try to put in (They even put a 'IT'S ME' easter egg too!).And of course, there are always a but.The horror itself is . . . Questionable. Since it is rated PG 13, the horror level became, in my opinion, horrendously low, and filled with offscreen deaths (James from DeadMeat ain't going to like this one) and artless jumpscares. The director failed to make me spooked or relatively scared. And it's campy too. There is one scene that almost makes me think that this movie is just a dark comedy. But I'd laughed along.And the storytelling. Barely any problems with it. So far so good. Though, I feel like the game lore has become overly simplified in the movie. I mean, I'm not complaining, because the lore might be thoroughly rooted out across the next movies, but unless the producers are actually not going to implement the whole lore into the movies at all, they should've given us some hints. Like about the Afton family and Henry Emily. Where are they? I mean, they are who made FNAF, FNAF practically. Elizabeth, the Crying Child, and Charlotte, all of them.But it makes no matter. All in all, the movie is a pretty fun ride for me, and I hope some of ya'll game loyalists out there can just relax and enjoy the show too. If there is a sequel in the future, I would definitely go and watch it just for my own entertainment :)",2023-10-27
"This movie is peak and lived up to all my expectations. If you are a die hard fnaf fan you will love this movie is packed with Easter eggs and the story is amazing. The critics are talking bs this thing is definitely worth watching in theaters with a packed room of fnaf fans to really experience How good of a movie blumhouse and Scott have put together. Definitely worth the 8 years that so many people have been waiting for. Im calling it this will be the best movie of the century and for generations to come. So what are you waiting for, go to your nearest theater and buy tickets for it as soon as possible.",2023-10-28
"We all wanted an FNAF movie and low an behold that's what we got.FNAF is the dumbest movie all time. It's more dumb than the game it's based on which I am taught to hate by 30 year old men online.FNAF Is about Mike a security guard who tackles a child abductor who is actually father of a son all because of past trauma of his brother being taken away now he must work the night shift as security guard at a Chuck E Cheese ripoff called Freddy Fazbears. They should have let us see the trauma first and this would have been a more clever movie.Mike is an anxiety and depression riddled manchild which no one likes. This will lead to nothing but flashbacks that are earily shot like an M Night Shyamalan or A24 film with the kids who are the animatronics appear. It's much less clever when this movie just repeats the same secen over and over againAnyway, there are jump scares in this movie but only for a Balloon boy toy.The pizzeria is being looked after despite being abandoned.It's not cut and dry based on the actual game. There are characters and lore from FNAF 3 in 1 so it will never sequel bait like so many other fail movies have.You might as well skip the whole entire franchise and go to FNAF security breach.Pros
+Realistic animatronics
+Somewhat good atmosphere
+One part of the movie there's a a bunch of robbers who get horribly gored by the robots.+Five nights at Freddies fan song plays
+Well shotCons
-Too much unnecessary character development for a movie about murderous robots
-Too many flashbacks
-Questionable setting
-Messed up lore.-Idiotic fursuit/animatronic mechanics don't make sense.Overall, see it to laugh at how dumb it is.",2023-11-01
"Probably the first person to put this. I loved it and thought it was great. It's for the fans and isn't gory since there was no gore i. The game so idk what people expected from a $20 million budget film. It's funny how people waited 8 years to see this movie just to give it a bad review. I loved all the work they put into it like the animatronics and the restaurant. They used actual objects instead of CGI to make it look more real instead fake. I like to see other people try to make a good movie like that with a $50 million dollar budget. Also, the movie is more of a game movie instead of a horror one.",2023-10-28

"Scott Cawthon's popular video game makes its big leap to the big screen thanks to the king of modern horror cinema Blumhouse. Making a film adaptation of Five Nights At Freddy's was really easy, since the video game is not complex at all. It's a pretty simple story that doesn't need much explanation and the movie does it well. Mike's trauma contributes enough to give mobility to the plot and manages to link it with the events of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. The design of the animatronics is amazing, respecting the characters of the video game a lot. They look adorable and scary at the same time. Using practical effects was a great success instead of using digital effects and adding the retro style that Freddy Fazbear's Pizza has makes the film have an eighties feel. Also, one thing that is clear is that the animatronics are actually not as evil as they used to be painted. In fact, the film gives a good justification for the actions of the animatronics and relates quite a bit to the dark past of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Even the famous song that was composed by The Living Tombstone already gave a clear explanation in the lyrics. The video game has always been characterized by its jumpscares and the movie has few jumpscares, but the concept of Five Nights At Freddy's goes far beyond that. It's not exactly the kind of horror movie one would expect to see since it's pretty soft. It is more of a horror film aimed at a child audience that really works perfectly. The Five Nights At Freddy's video games were always aimed at children and adolescents and the fact that the film is aimed at that type of audience is a success. It is quite faithful to the source material and maintains the games' level of suspense. Five Nights At Freddy's is another great achievement for the world of video game adaptations and a nice movie to enjoy with the entire family. My final rating for this movie is a 10/10.",2023-10-27
"If you think of a family-friendly movie mixed with some horror, that is what Five Nights at Freddy's is. It's not bad, but I'm surprised that here where I live in Norway this movie is from 15 years old, I just don't quiet get it. Besides of a weird Norwegian age rating, this was an enjoyable, fun movie about a man called Mike who gets a job in an abandoned Pizza place and has to make sure no one mess with the place. Everyone knows the plot, it was very clear in the trailers. So I focused on the rest, and I have to admit, this movie had some strong sides that really turned out great, but also some lame things that I just didn't think was necessary. The robots did turn out great, I don't know if they were actually built or just computer animation, but one thing for sure: They looked real! That was a good side. Freddy, Cupcake, Foxy, Chica and Bonnie did turn out great as side characters. I can call them that, but at the same time they were so important. Because the real antagonist was someone else, and that is when things started to get a little weird.The new villain that was introduced at the end, The Yellow Rabbit, was honestly something I was never expecting, but never wanted either. He was something that just come in the end, and suddenly they took all the characters away and just focused on that guy, what really took the plot off. The plot twist at the end was good, but was kind of weird, with the concept that The Yellow Rabbit trapped children inside those robots and manipulated them, with no purpose. That did really hit my rating down, but before that, the plot was amazing! The mysteries behind the place and the crazy dreams of our main hero Mike, and how he desperately tries to find his brother after The Yellow Rabbit kidnapped him. Everything was cool then, ok? But later we got everything, all the answers came and it wasn't much interesting. Besides, the things that happened after was very predictable, too, so not many big surprises after. But that doesn't mean this movie was a disaster, because it got many good technical things and more! The music was great. The suspenseful music and the very fun ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" song by The Living Tombstone was so great in the end credits, when everything closed and the great rock came in. The light set-up and camera-work was good, with some good scenography, the Pizza Place where the place took in, did look very good, with all of the things and features hidden inside. A lot of darkness like in many horrors, but what was good here was a little bit of light so I could see something, at least. The characters were also great. The strong bond between Mike and his sister, Abby, was very well played by Josh Hutcherson and Piper Rubio, that really took some engagement in this. The rest of the actors were decent. If I have to be honest, of everything I have listed up, this was an ok entertaining movie, that missed details that could have been fixed, but overall this was a fun Halloween movie that I recommend to watch with your friends!",2023-10-27
"Dear Scott Cawthon and the FNAF Movie team,Your movie was awful. Truly awful. It was uninteresting to look at, the characters were insufferable, the acting wasn't good, and it was inaccurate to the story of the games. I truly hope that in the future, the team will spend more time working on a fully fleshed-out story that will satisfy more die-hard fans. I expected a much better movie with how huge the games are but this movie could not have been executed as badly as it was I feel bad for the actors some of them were good but wasted potential if it was for the writer's strike happening I bet this movie would've has been made much better. I gave it a 2 cause I do enjoy the fnaf games.Sincerely, Ravioli Alfred.",2023-10-27
"You know, most critics don't have any idea about the lore of fnaf. For hardcore fans this movie is amazing. It could have not been Pg-13. That would make it even more exciting. The movie overall gives us a lot of information and truly is scary. I believe it is one of the best I've seen so far. If you don't know anything about fnaf, you won't get why the rest are having huge reactions. I would suggest to learn more about the lore before watching this movie. Otherwise you won't truly understand and get the full experience. I would highly recommend watching it. I might even go watch it a second time. It is truly worth it.",2023-10-26
"I know nothing about this story other than it came from a video game. To me, it looked like a decent little scary movie and it was. Not the perfect flick because at PG13 there's only so much they can do. I think had the makers let loose and went all out on an R rated movie, this could have been the most outrageously entertaining movie this year.For those like me who walk into this knowing nothing, check your brain at the door and just sit back and relax.There's some supernatural things happening at the old Chuck E. Cheese spot and it's not friendly. The hero is a flawed, down on his lick guy looking for work. Beware of the creepy Matthew Lillard when he sets you up with a job. There's some decent special effects with practical scenarios that could happen when folks are at the end of their rope. The third act can be a little confusing but I found it to be satisfactory and so will you.",2023-10-27
"In the eyes of a normal movie goer the Five Nights at Freddy's movie isn't anything special. It's a confusing story with an outlandish story coupled with cringey campy dialogue and not being really scary. But in the eyes of a FNAF fan who waited 8 long years for this movie to become a reality... it's everything you'd hope and dream for! Like come on, a confusing convoluted story, that's basically the entire lore of Five Nights at Freddy's! The callbacks and references in this movie will make you want to stand up and cheer in the theater!The ""horror"" isn't exactly that scary but at times the movie does match the creepy and terrifying atmosphere the animatronic characters give off in the games but it's only in the beginning of the movie and one sequence at around the halfway mark when thieves break in and smash up Freddy's to get Mike, the current guard, fired. The animatronics pick them off one by one and at times can be fairly brutal.The star of this movie is easily Matthew Lillard, although it's criminal that he has so little screen time, his portrayal of William Afton is spot on and his acting skills show. One example of this is when Mike is being interviewed by William and as William reads Mikes file he notices his last name and freezes his demeanor changes almost immediately going from a normal career counselor dealing with another client to an almost nervous demeanor almost like he has something to hide from Mike (which we find out later William abducted and killed Mikes younger brother) and immediately offers the Security job at Freddy's. He almost seems desperate in having Mike take the job at times hinting that he wants Mike to go there to be killed so he'll never find out it was Afton who killed his brother. Later on in his final scenes Matthew truly shows off his ability to play this murderous psychopath ,as he has shown in his previous films, as he brilliantly brings the character of William Afton to life in the iconic spring lock suit. He even goes as far as stabbing his own daughter but Matthew portrays a moment of slight remorse and regret after doing so perfectly, and during his death scene he quotes Aftons most iconic line from the games ""I ALWAYS COME BACK"" although the line delivery is a little rushed ,come on, we've been waiting for someone to say that on the big screen for 8 years now! Matthew is the MVP of the movie for sure!The PG-13 rating does hold back the movie in some areas most importantly the spring lock scene which I will admit is a little too tame and bloodless for such a gruesome sounding death. An R rating would have really helped this movie convey the horror and sheer terror of these massive possessed machines but the movie does push the PG-13 rating to the limit in terms of violence and in a good way! One particular scene is when one of the characters from the aforementioned break in gets pulled into the mouth of Freddy and gets chomped in HALF! Even in the games this never happens so it took everyone in the theater by surprise but like I said before in a good way. Another scene shows one of the robbers getting there face chewed up by the Cupcake, and later on we see the gory aftermath.The other actors are fine there are some campy and corny lines but it's FNAF it's to be expected but no there is no ""we are fnaf"" scene but there is a scene where the night guard along with his sister and Vanessa, Afton's daughter, build a pillow fort with the animatronics. Yes it's campy and Bonnie even falls over and gives a thumbs up when asked if he's ok but it's important to keep in mind these are children possessing these robots and the movie needs a scene to get the audience to sympathize with them in some way before they turn on Afton at the end of the movie so this was the best course of action in my opinion.Overall the movie is perfect for fans and for me personally (a fan) it is a perfect 10/10 but for an average movie goer who doesn't know anything about the lore or what came before this movie honestly I can see why they wouldn't like this movie and rate it 4/10 or lower.",2023-10-28
"You know what was missing from the games? A 30 minute introduction of the protagonist showing in excruciating detail why he needs the job. I was worried, walking into the theater, it was going to be nonstop, homicidal, animatronic action. Luckily that's only a very small portion of the film. The real story is about a young man trying to raise his orphaned sister and overcome a tragic past. You might be mistaken, and think the villain is some sort of supernatural animatronic bear or an evil corporation that owns the arcade. Fortunately these are professional writers and producers. No, the real villain is his evil aunt. Not the murderous machines living in the decrepit arcade.. It's some woman and her lawyer. What a twist!I'm now about halfway through the movie. I really hate it. Like, before I could make light of it, but now I'm just disgusted.What I learned from this movie is childhood therapy is pointless. If you have a kid that's withdrawn, the best way to break them out of their shell is for them to see a mechanical monster kill their evil aunt and torture a crazy man in a bunny suit. You might think that would mess a kid up, but according FNAF lore it's really therapeutic.",2023-11-01
Absolutely incredible this movie. Despite not many jumpscares. I loved it. I saw this with my partner at Glenorchy Village Cinemas and we both loved it.There was some funny bits. I'm the kind of person that jumps at anything but I only jumped a couple of times and I was also enjoying it.I've played the game before. I have jumped at that but I'm good at trying not to flinch too much.Watching the movie was awesome and now I'm counting the days till the movie comes out on dvd and I can't wait to get it. It only came out and I'm already waiting for it come out.Whoever made this well done on making this movie. You get a 10 star review rate from me and my partner.,2023-10-28
"Awesome movie faithful to the game! It made you feel like you were inside the game because of the intense uneasy feeling it provided. The animatronics were breathtaking to look at. I loved that the Jim Henson Workshop did a masterful work to make the animatronics puppets instead of CGI. I loved how they used the lore of the dead children possessing the robots, which added an otherworldly feel to the film. Josh Hutcherson was amazing as Mike Schmidt, he was a very complex and emotional character. My favorite performance was Matthew Lilliard as William Afton! He was perfect for the role because he was both charismatic and terrifying to watch! I got the chills when he was onscreen! My only complaint is the dream plot felt a little unnecessary and I wish we would have gotten more scenes at the pizzeria with the animatronics. I also wish Abby's ability was explored more because it was a little confusing at times, but other than that, it was a phenomenal movie!",2023-10-28
"As a big fan of the games, This movie was amazing. From the cinematography to pretty much everything. First, the plot was pretty good. For people not knowing, in the games the animatronics have been known to be bad around adults, as stated in fnaf 2. But that story was great cause in the games there's a minigame just like the ending. For the fans they have delivered very well and also the experience of watching it in a movie theater made it so much better. Personally, more jumpscares would have been great because it's what the games are all about. But if you are a fan of the games this movie would be amazing and if you have never heard of five nights at Freddy's, I recommend you play some of the games and then go back to the movie because you need some knowledge from the games. So if you think the movie was more boring since you dont know much of the story, i recommend you watch youtube videos of it and then come back to it because it would be so much better. But yea one of the best expieriences i have ever had in a movie theater and it was a 10/10 movie would defenitely come back to it 100%.",2023-10-28
"This movie was pure TRASH. It's like i've been waiting for NOTHING. So disappointed. Let me tell you the MAIN flaws. First of all, the movie is not accurate to the lore. Who the hell is ""Garrett"" and ""Abby"".... WHO???? I absolutely hated that scene where the animatronics helped them built a fort?? SERIOUSLY? They would NOT do that. They would 100% kill them with no hesitation. Just because it's a little kid doesn't mean she should not be killed. Cmon scott. I also hated the parts where they played the same scene multiple times. A lot of flaws but I don't have enough time. You had one chance. Ugh.",2023-10-27
"Went and saw this movie with my son. He loves fnaf as do many kids. I honestly thought this was a really good movie. As a parent it's even creepier with the plot. The animatronic characters were scary and fun at the same time. And from game to screen, I think it was done well.REMEMBER PEOPLE THIS IS FOR FANS NOT CRITICSNOT EVERY MOVIE IS MADE TO WIN AWARDSthis is my sons intro to horror like mine with attack of the killer tomatoes. I honestly wouldn't even be writing on here if it wasn't for my son. Just go watch the movie and remember there's way worse movies to criticize that are now cult classics.",2023-10-28
"This story could have worked just as well in the hands of Tim Burton.. instead of Scott Cawthon.""Five Nights at Freddy's"" is a slow-paced horror film that offers a dull story and little to none of the terror that a film of this genre should provide.The Animatronics were beautiful, but that's it. For a film almost a decade in the making, it disappoints. It has more plot holes than Swiss cheese.Of course fans of the game will love this film. It's very faithful and has a lot of Easter eggs. It's not very scary, except for a few scares.Anyway, if you are a casual viewer you will not like this film.",2023-10-27
"As A Fan Of The Games And Story I believe it's Not A Horrible Movie.The Story Can Feel a Bit Clustered At Times, But I get it it's a Film it has to add certain things to satisfy the studios or certain to keep viewers attention. Nothing is always as it should be.Visually, The film wasn't shot Bad, I wish they would've added the Security cameras a bit more, but that's just the fan talking.Acting wise, with having some solid B tier actors and actresses who are on the decline they did a pretty good job, especially with casting. Matthew Lillard is and will always be great to me. If he was in a few more minor shots that led up to his reveal of being the villain I would've appreciated it.But overall the movie is a 4/10 for me. Would I watch it again? No.Would I watch the sequel? Yes.",2023-11-01
"Me personally loved it,but if your new to the series you wouldn't get it, now they should've made it rated R but it plays well with the pg 13, but the rating makes it feel held back. Regardless if you know the games and the lore you'll love this don't believe the negative reviews. Now there are some little things here and there for me like the animatronics kinda being a little soft looking and clunky but I digress. I also feel that there was a little bit too much introduced and left behind but they can definitely come back to it in a second movie which in my opinion is definitely deserved. The acting was very good and in joy able . CGI hardly used but when it was 50/50 if it looked good but again hardly used at all. Go see it negative reviews are only from new people and real sticklers for the lore.",2023-10-27
"The movie is not the same as the game we played as child. The jumpscare, horror, psychological horror was the reasons why the game was so successful. And that just wasn't in the movie at all, the plot was full chaos, cast wasn't good. While it's important to remember that opinions on movies can be highly subjective, some viewers and critics have expressed their disappointment with the ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" (FNAF) movie for several reasons. It's worth noting that the FNAF movie was in development at the time of my last knowledge update in January 2022, and the final product may have evolved since then. With that in mind, here are some reasons why some people might have considered the FNAF movie to be less than satisfying:Firstly, the adaptation from video games to film can be a challenging endeavor. The FNAF games are known for their suspenseful and immersive gameplay, and translating this tension to a movie format is no easy task. Some fans of the games might have been disappointed if they felt that the movie failed to capture the same level of suspense and fear that the games provided.Secondly, the characters and lore of the FNAF series are complex and deep, with a rich backstory that has been developed over multiple game installments. Adapting this lore into a two-hour movie can be tricky, and there's the risk of oversimplification or leaving out essential details that fans love. Some critics of the FNAF movie might argue that it didn't do justice to the complexity of the game's narrative.Thirdly, casting and character portrayal can be a contentious issue in any adaptation. If fans had particular expectations for how the characters should look and act, any deviation from these expectations could lead to disappointment. It's not uncommon for fans of a franchise to have strong attachments to their favorite characters, and any perceived misrepresentation can be a source of frustration.Fourthly, the tone of the FNAF movie is essential. The games have a unique blend of horror and dark humor, and striking the right balance in a movie adaptation can be challenging. If the movie leaned too heavily in one direction, it might have alienated some fans who were hoping for a different tone.Fifthly, the pacing and structure of the movie can be problematic. Video games and movies are different mediums, and what works in one might not work in the other. Some viewers might have found the pacing of the FNAF movie to be uneven or felt that it didn't maintain their interest throughout its duration.Lastly, it's essential to acknowledge that some people's expectations for the FNAF movie might have been unreasonably high. The FNAF franchise has a dedicated and passionate fan base, and sometimes, high expectations can lead to disappointment no matter how well a movie is executed.In conclusion, while the reasons mentioned above represent some of the potential issues viewers and critics might have had with the FNAF movie, it's important to remember that opinions on films are subjective. What one person considers a disappointment, another might find enjoyable. The success of any movie, especially one based on a beloved franchise like FNAF, depends on various factors, and it's possible that some viewers were left unsatisfied for the reasons mentioned above or others. However, it's essential to keep in mind that the movie industry is constantly evolving, and the FNAF movie may have undergone changes and improvements since my last update in January 2022.",2023-10-29
"Incredible masterpiece, I was surprised how greatly they captured the essence of FNAF. The Animatronics were amazing, the mini balloon boy was hilarious, and just the attention to details was incredible. Honestly I hope that movie number 2 will be even better. I'm still so shocked by how great it was. Yet many people say it is bad but for me it was a wonderful experience to go to the movies and watch a movie that I have been waiting for so long. The appearance of Springtrap was also pretty good, not to mention some super iconic quotes and phrases of characters. I think this idea of movies are great and, in the end, I really am hoping to watch what they have planned for the sequel.",2023-10-28

"This movie was an absolute let down given the absurd amount of time it has been in production. The movie does not follow the title it is meant to adapt in any note able capacity. In all fairness, I do not think an adaptation has to be beat for beat, and I am all for changes to existing content so as to not be alienating to new comers. With that being said, the movie is very clearly made for existing fans, but pays little mind to them in it's story telling. I can say with 100% certainty that anyone with no context of prior material would be lost to anything that was going on.I and all my long term obsessions with the games was lost for a good chunk of it myself. The only redeeming qualities about the film were the fantastic works by the Jim Henson company on the animatronics, the set design, and the inclusion of noteable music as a nod to fans without shameless and out of place cameos. I feel many of the actors' performances suffered greatly from poor direction, so I can't fault them to much. The film would've benefited greatly from an R rating, it's attempts to balance two audiences were clearly not placed in the right hands, and any gorey scenes felt like something you'd find in Birdemic.The writers also appeared to be unwilling to stick to a tone, jumping between family friendly hallmark shenanigans and saw traps. Not to say this can't be done well, it can, but it wasn't. At the very least, it was a somewhat enjoyable watch. In the relm of so-bad-its-good through parts, and a complete drag through others. For just over an hour and a half movie, Avatar (the blue people one) feels shorter.Overall, it's terrible. A pretty shameless cash-grab through the majority, with a few moments of release that at least pulled a laugh or hype here and there. Not worth paying to see in theater, but if you're curious there is always peacock. TLDR.. it's bad. Sorry to all my fellow FNAF kids who were waiting for this one.",2023-10-28
"The moment I saw Freddy, Bonnie, Chicago, and Foxy building a fort with furniture in the movie, I couldn't help but raise an eyebrow. It's like they suddenly decided to embark on an arts and crafts project in the midst of all the horror. While the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise has never shied away from blending humor with terror, this particular scene left me scratching my head. It's a bizarre juxtaposition that seemed out of place in the overall atmosphere of the film. However, perhaps it was a deliberate attempt to inject some levity into the story or take the audience by surprise. Regardless, it was an unexpected twist in an already mysterious and unpredictable narrative.Five Nights at Freddy's has always been known for its ability to create tension and fear through its animatronic characters. The animatronics come to life at night, and players must survive their antics while working as a security guard. This premise has been the cornerstone of the franchise's success, making it a beloved title among gamers and fans of horror.The movie adaptation, however, takes a different approach. While it still maintains the eerie essence of the game, it seems to explore the animatronics in a more complex light. The idea of these animatronic characters engaging in a lighthearted activity like building a fort is intriguing but raises several questions. Are they truly the menacing figures we've come to fear, or is there a deeper layer to their characters? The fort-building scene opens up the possibility of character development and a different perspective on these iconic antagonists.The movie's plot, on the whole, appears to be a deviation from the game's lore. This shift can be both refreshing and unsettling for long-time fans. On one hand, it offers a chance to explore a new narrative within the Five Nights at Freddy's universe, potentially delving into the backstory of these animatronics and the mysteries of the pizzeria. On the other hand, it runs the risk of alienating fans who are deeply attached to the original lore and the terror it instilled.The fort-building scene, in particular, symbolizes this potential departure from the familiar. It serves as a visual metaphor for the blending of genres and themes in the film. As we witness these characters engage in an innocent activity, we're left wondering if this is a clever subversion of expectations or a sign of a narrative that may be losing its way.In a way, this unpredictability mirrors the Five Nights at Freddy's games, where you can never be entirely sure what will happen next. The film might be trying to capture that essence of uncertainty and fear, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats with unexpected plot twists. If that's the intention, then the fort-building scene is a bold move in that direction.The success of a film adaptation like this often hinges on how well it balances the elements of its source material with the demands of cinematic storytelling. In the case of Five Nights at Freddy's, it's walking a fine line between staying faithful to the game's horror roots and introducing new, unexplored territory.As a long-time fan of the franchise, I appreciate the effort to take risks and expand the lore. It's clear that the creators want to keep the essence of surprise alive, just as the games did. While the fort scene may be perplexing at first glance, it might be a clever storytelling choice that ultimately contributes to a more layered and intriguing narrative.In the end, the success of the film will depend on how well it can strike a balance between the expectations of loyal fans and the desire to introduce something fresh and unexpected. The fort scene, in all its absurdity, might just be the key to achieving that balance and creating a film that leaves a lasting impact in the world of horror cinema.So, while I was initially taken aback by the absurdity of Freddy, Bonnie, Chicago, and Foxy building a fort with furniture, I'm willing to give the movie the benefit of the doubt. After all, the world of Five Nights at Freddy's has always thrived on the unexpected and the unsettling. This scene, bizarre as it may be, could be a sign that the film is ready to take us on a thrilling and unconventional ride into the heart of the FNAF universe.",2023-10-26
"This movie is.a great way to make new fans and please the old. The plot somewhat sticks to the story of a few of the games which is great because as a fan of the game series since watching play through of the first game back in 2014, this was exciting to go to the theater and finally witness the concept come to life. I'm happy with what was done. The plot is great, and of course the jumpscares aren't gonna be scary because of the audience you're trying to surround this movie with. Makes for a great introductory film into this hopefully jaw dropping trilogy. Can't wait to see what blumhouse and scott are gonna produce with this franchise on the big screen again. Overall. Great popcorn experience and good movie.",2023-10-27
As a fan of the series i was severely disappointed. In a lot of ways the movie was a testament to the series as a whole at this point. A jumbled mess of underdeveloped story elements. The story is mediocre and the acting is goofy at points. All of this could have been forgiven if the movie delivered on what is was marked as but it doesn't. The movie lacks the horror atmosphere present in the games. From the goofy death scenes to the Disney Channel level acting the movie is more of a comedy movie than a horror movie. The story feels very generic and like it could be tacked on to any franchises. It seems like the writers were more focused on fan service than providing a good horror experience.,2023-10-28
"What a disappointment. Sometimes you go in to a movie expecting it to be average, but let me tell you my expectations of it even making average were shattered.The movie has moments of great looking cinematography though kept blurring the background which reminded me of someone who had found the Portrait setting on the iPhone for the first time with a focus setting which looked terrible.The worst part of all is the dialogue from the characters. Vanessa was the worst culprit for this, saying things that wouldn't be very characteristic for any normal person let alone someone who's a police officer.I always get disheartened by movies like this that have an idea that could produce a great movie, yet don't take the care to make a good movie. Understandably the movie was put at a 15+ bbfc instead of reaching for that 18+ rating which handcuffs the possibilities to reach a further audience - in this case the young Video Game audience though I must admit, 18+ wouldn't even make this a good movie.",2023-10-27
"I've been waiting years for this and I am NOT disappointed. The story is different than the games but it gives new opportunity for theorizing like how in this story Vanessa is the afton kid. And there are many moments that make you so excited and remember the games like foxy singing his little tune, the ""I always come back"" (which when I saw it had the theater SCREAMING and cheering), the way Vanessa introduces herself. And then the MatPat cameo is so exciting too because he is so invested in fnaf and it made me and my friends really excited. There is a story similar to the games but so different at the same time, there is nostalgia that doesn't make you feel like it's a lot, it provides new material for theories, something new for fans to enjoy, and had enough gore to make it scary but still got to be pg-13. There is also parts that make you remember the games and things that happen that are so bad but all you can do is laugh or jump in your seat because you know the games and you know what will happen so all you can do is gasp and laugh. There is also just normal humor in the film like the balloon boy just popping up to scare people which was really funny. I'm giving this a 10/10 because it was a really nice change and different from the normal story and let fans relive these game moments in excitement. Honestly I know some people thought this movie was dumb, childish, and didn't have a good story, but I think it provided everything it needed to and I had an amazing time watching it.",2023-10-28
"I've (like most other fans) spent way too much time watching MatPat on game theory about the story behind the games and I think it did such a good job. I can see why it's a bit polarizing as if you didn't have all the background knowledge it can seem a bit cliche but as a fan of the games and their story, I loved it. Also the cameos were absolutely amazing. Especially the waiter 😉. I really hope that they make more and I am so glad I could watch it on Peacock the same day it came out in theaters. It was a super fun movie and with the amount of games and lore not included in this, I hope they make more. Also the practical effects for the animatronics was a great idea. I think CGI could have come off as a bit exaggerated. Anyways love it and would recommend to any fans.",2023-10-28
"The movie is paced really weird and the plot either moves too quickly or not at all , the animatronics look extraordinary but the acting is very lacklustre and there is no real enthusiasm going into any of these roles except from Matthew Lillard and even still I was disappointed.All of the ""horror moments"" were silly and not scary at all
The plot twists were boring and easily predictable even if you're not familiar with FNAF lore.TLDR; it's like they tried to make a horror movie but didn't want to make it TOO scary for the kids watching but unfortunately Scooby Doo 2002 made for a scarier film ...
Best part of the movie is the visuals and music at the end of the day, the plot / acting could have been better by a mile.",2023-10-29
"In all honesty, movie was actually pretty decent but it has an issue with leaning into the fact that it's based off fnaf and not being an actual movie. Plot was okay but predictable but I'm sure the hardcore fnaf fans will appreciate the cameos they do in the movie.As for watching this in a movie theater it was a horrible experience. Me and my girlfriend had a hard time getting into the movie because all the kids would no stop talking during the movie and would yell at the worst jump scares. I don't know if this is just a me experience but it was honestly the worst movie theater experience i've had.",2023-10-31
"I'm putting a 1 because I can't put a 0. The film doesn't make any sense, the script has open flaws, there's no character building, it didn't take the references from the games (Mike doesn't even spend 5 nights at Freddy's), the plot twist is extremely weak which I could understand from the first 20 minutes of the film. Detail: the film isn't even horror, it doesn't scare you and it doesn't have any psychological terror.The reason they gave for the animatronics being cursed is so weak, so poor, so meaningless that for that reason alone it deserves a low score.Other than that, what is the need to delve deeper into the issue of Abby's custody? What did this add to the story? ANYTHING!",2023-10-31
"Through the years of learning and understanding FNAF through my son I really enjoyed this film. Like many others I had my doubts on how they would develop a creative story to tells its fans through a movie rather than a video game but they nailed it! We were all very impressed from the artistic attributes to the animatronics, Freddy Faze Bears play place and restaurant. The acting was outstanding! Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lillard gave out extraordinary performances in the film as well as (""Coreyxkenshin"" <- for the real fans!)This video game franchise has had significant success with their released video games and I believe that they will have more success with FNAF movies in the future!",2023-10-28
"(spoilers)not only did it not follow the plot, the addition of characters from separate games that have never interacted with each other not only made the movie less worthwhile but also boring af. I think all the go fans of the franchise like me would agree that the crossover between security breach characters and what seems to be the original final 1 movie was unnecessary. The fan service felt like an excuse and somewhat an attempt to cover up the many plot holes and confusing parts this movie has that do not go along with the actual lore of the game. I was excited from the start as the first jumpscare set a great atmosphere and some expectations. However, as the movie progress, it made less and less sense (not because it's a bad movie, because it is a rather poor adaptation to such an iconic game). Like, come on, supposed William Afton taking his mask off revealing himself and being the guy who hired mike and also Vanessa's father???? The acting from the actors of Vanessa and mike was great, don't get me wrong--I think they hired the right people for the job, but it's the script that is entirely off. It is a rather difficult job to fit so much lore and so many details in chronological order into one movie anyway, but adding random things just for the sake of creating a movie at the end just makes the movie lose its initial purpose, which is the way it's meant to be an adaptation of the game. The graphics were better than I expected, the animatronics were decent--obviously could be more elevated by creating that dark and truly bone-chilling aesthetics of the first game, but that's fine. One aspect that turned this movie from horror, which I believe what we all experienced as kids playing this game, to a children's movie, was how we constantly saw the animatronics move. The entire scare factor of the games comes from the anticipation of a jumpscare and never knowing where the animatronics are. Not seeing them move makes the games, especially the first three (and I guess somewhat the forth one too) so scary. The animatronics becoming abby's friend? Making a fort with her? Mike so easily figuring out and coming to terms with how the animatronics are possessed by ghost children? Like what...the pathetic excuse of a wrap up in the end was even more saddening. In the final games, there's no sort of 'ending'. The lore is so deep that there's almost no incentive anymore--hence it is extremely difficult to convey the events of the game in the form of a movie. Perhaps if they took the documentary/found-footage route, it would be a much more interesting and at least accurate to the events of the game. This way, they wouldn't feel the need to 'wrap up' and show everyone having a great time and get their happy ending, since no such thing really happens in the games. There'd be no need to adopt the usual intro-build up-climax-conclusion format that a fictional movie has, had they used a slightly different approach. They could even take inspiration from those fnaf vhs tapes you see on YouTube.I've waited a decade for this movie, and for me it just felt rushed and that perhaps, all the hype went to the producer's heads or something that they thought adding in just anything as long as they had fan service and many references would be acceptable. Disappointed, to say the least.Yes, they've made a movie. Great. But this definitely isn't something I'll be calling 'THE fnaf movie', nor is it something that will go down in the history books of the fnaf franchise or something. It's funny how it feels like Scott was barely involved in the scripting of this. I'm assuming he just had to be there since he...well...made the game. And in a way it is nice to finally get what we've been wanting for this entire time.Still, it did not live up to the expectations (and was even worse than I expected).",2023-10-28
"First of all, I'm not a fan of horror movies, but I wanted to give this a go because I used to play the game years ago. I never liked the horror stuff about FNAF, but I always found the story very interesting and mysterious. This movie has great effects and a good cinematic look, especially some shots were dope! The thing I disliked the most and probably ruined everything for me were the scare jumps. I couldn't watch those scenes because I knew what was coming. I can't call this movie bad because it wasn't, but honestly i'm not a fan of horror movies and I will never be. I know how hard is to make a movie, because i'm also a filmmaker in free time and how easy is to judge from the sofa or from the chair, but for me the fact that it had those jumpscares ruined everything.",2023-10-30
"""Five Nights At Freddy"" is the most unlikely hero for cinemas during the Hollywood strike.People are flocking to see Blumhouse's first Game to Movie adaptation.Rightly so because Director Emma Tammi (""The Wind"" on Prime) is back in charge of her biggest horror film budget to date.The good news for the producers is this movie has already made back its expensive outlay through selling the streaming and theatrical distribution rights before one bum sat in a darkened cinema.For anyone lucky enough to see ""The Banana Splits"" movie this plot line will be very familiar.Only because ""Five Nights At Freddy's"" was originally a Warner property before Blumhouse Productions bought the rights.I gave away my Splits DVD to charity recently, so I know there's at least one print in circulation.The hugely popular video game has its own cult following and that appeal clearly carried over onto the big screen judging by the excitement generated by the live audience to the point of clapping at its conclusion.It was originally a point and click survival horror game set in a family Pizzeria like a ""Chuck E. Cheese"" with giant animatronic creatures and a security guard who has to avoid being caught by said homicidal monsters.The movie version also has plenty of jump scares, but it also has heart.The security guard ""Mike's"" (Josh Hutcherson) life is not two dimensional instead it's fleshed out with vivid dreams and flashbacks to an event that shaped his life and altered it for him and his younger sister ""Abby"" (Piper Rubio) forever.This event causes him to have anger management issues and a need for prescription sleeping medication.Ironically when they press the ""Showtime"" button at Freddy's the Jim Henson Creatures come to life playing the lesser know hit by the Romantics ""Talking In Your Sleep"" (a classic 80's hit).Enter stage left 80's Bratpacker Mary Stuart Masterson (""Some Kind of Wonderful"") as cruel, smelling of cigarettes Aunt Jane who wants custody of Mike's sister (probably for cigarette money)
Watch out for: Matthew Lillard (""Scooby Doo"") as ""Steve Raglan"" proving there are no small roles.Elizabeth Lail (""You"" on Netflix) is the kind Cop ""Vanessa"" with her own issues to deal with.You don't have to know or even have played the video game phenomenon as this is a stand alone movie.What does disturb me is how many primary school children have played every horrific game in the series, yet somehow this movie littered with mutilated bodies, horror and violence is only rated M.Without doubt this is the best project the Blumhouse horror factory (a modern day Hammer Films) has put their stamp on in years.Thanks to good actors, script, editing, direction etc it works.Question is can you survive five nights at Freddy Fazbears Pizza or will you be pining for Nebraska?",2023-10-27
"Personally I found this movie extremely enjoyable, the story was entertaining, the visuals are incredible, and the acting was solid. The movie is very different from the original games, It's definitely more in vain of the books where the story is it's own thing from a different part of the canon.For me personally the only downside is that some parts of the story feel slow and others a bit too quick, however I'm hopeful that we'll end up getting another movie.Even despite that it was an Overall enjoyable experience as a longtime fan of the FNAF games and books, it's absolutely a watch it for yourself kind of film, simply getting your opinion from hearing others just isn't the best way to get an opinion.I'd heard multiple negative things heading into watching the film and it had greatly impacted my thoughts on the film at the time, but after a second watch through on Peacock I can confidently say that it's an enjoyable and well made movie, but at the end of the day that's all just my opinion as a longtime fan of the series.I'd recommend heading into the movie with an open mind and try to enjoy it, of course if it isn't for you that's ok as well.",2023-10-28
"Tbh this is something my kids (12 and 14yrs old) who have grown up with Five Nights at Freddy's, from playing it, me buying ""Plushies"", them reading books. I can honestly say they loved it and so did I. They sat here and explained almost everything that happened in the movie. I tbh thought these Plushies were just regular teddy bears kids get into but once my kids explained exactly what the movie explained I was in shock! **SPOILER** a guy that kidnapped kids and killed them and their souls/bodies were put into these animatronics. I did not know that was the backstory again I thought they was just teddy bears. Again I loved that they made a movie explaining what my kids already knew. I give it a 10. My boys have waited for this movie since they've played the game/plushies 6plus years and they did not disappoint. My kids and I are expecting another movie for sure.",2023-10-28
"Everything in here was iconic! Even William Afton's ""I always come back!"" quote!!! I went to see it with some friends and it was the most badass movie of the 21st century. We need to preserve this movie and make sure every generation sees this movie and to keep this movie and the game series alive. This movie really deserves more stars but all I have is 10 but please make sure this movie is preserved. It deserves too much and I love it myself. If the animatronics were real, I would be friends with them myself because of how wholesome they were to Abby.Ps- I know some parents are gonna say how it was too scary for their kids cuz the theater I was in had a ton of little kids.",2023-10-28
"Everything about this movie has and was fully dedicated for the fans of the Five Night's at Freddy's franchise. Scott Cawthon and Emma Tammi did an amazing job and all of the details were just right. While the game series plot may be a mess, this movie was very easy to understand and follow. As a member of the FNaF community, I enjoyed every second of this movie. Even my sister, a lesser FNaF fan, enjoyed pointing out all the details and jumping (pun intended) from the jumpscares present in the movie. Not once did I feel like something was done cheaply or barely taken from the source material. Each twist and turn was done perfectly and kept me at the edge of my seat, even with knowing mass amounts of FNaF lore. While I do feel that the dual release in theaters and streaming might damage the revenue made from this movie, it's good to know that all of it's budget was made back just from promotional material alone and that all revenue from here on will be nothing but gain.I hope to see more FNaF films in the future with the same feel as this one. 10/10.",2023-10-27
"Kinda fun, though very forgettable. I came out if the screening and had forgot what I had just watched.The story makes sense, kind of, well, big chunks of the story seem added in because they realised the animatromics weren't really up to much. Some things seem overexplained while other things you're just expected to know, which leads to a conclusion where stuff happens and you just have to accept it.Tonally, it was all over the place.I guess I understand some of the lore behind FNAF now, having never cares before but still feeling pretty much the same way.I hope fans of the games, books, whatever other media it has jump scared it's way into, enjoyed the film.",2023-10-30
"Mike can't keep a job. He can't pay his rent or the babysitter, and he can't properly look after his little sister Abby. When he risks losing custody of Abby to his Aunt, Jane, he takes the first job that comes along - offered to him by job counselor Steve Raglan. (Raglan being the job counselor and the later reveal about his character was a bit too convenient.)Mike starts working as a security officer at a rundown pizzeria called Freddy's. No longer in use, the building is subjected to constant break-ins, and the owner - apparently having sentimental value over the pizzeria - hires a security officer to watch the place. It is a very creepy place and makes for a scary setting.Hoping to prove Mike incompetent so she can gain custody of Abby, Jane hires juveniles to break into Freddy's and trash the place. However, when they break in, they encounter murderous animatronics that came to life.Mike has a tragic back story: when he was twelve years old, his little brother was taken, and never found. His back story and the present intertwines , which can be very confusing at times. He also has dreams about the past and its not always clear when he has nightmares or memories.The film offers effective jump scares and a few twists in the mix as well. I firmly believed this was going to be just another slasher movie, but it has a lot more substance. The unique and creepy antagonists are bound to give a younger audience nightmares - what with those glowing yellow eyes! For me, this definitely will go down as a memorable watch.",2023-10-30
"""Is it good?"" Well is the Super Mario movie good? Are the Silent Hill movies good? It's hard to evaluate cuz it certainly drops below average on my regular movie meter, but I do appreciate the adaptation from and allusion to the game itself. The only thing commendable about the film is Josh Hutcherson's performance - or as I like to call him Peeta - which captures the dispiritedness and mental obsession of the character really accurately. I also like the subsurface theme of child abduction that gets sprinkled throughout the first two acts, but the finale kinda ruins the whole thing. We get introduced to the modified version of Springtrap out of nowhere, Vanessa does the criss-cross-apple-sauce with her identity, and most disappointingly we don't get Mike to do the real-life game play in the security room. If movie companies wanna keep doing game-derived films, please do use The Last of Us as paradigm.",2023-10-30
"When I came into the theater I was so excited to watch the movie (9 years of waiting). The movie started and it was great so far but then 1 hour of lore mixing hell started. It wasn't matching up with the original lore and when I seen the animatronics dancing and playing with Abby I was sure at the wrong movie. I couldn't believe how bad the lore was. But the end was good. Spring lock scene (it was alright), end credits (really good). And the acting was good don't get me wrong but it was just not enough. Overall in my opinion I will give the movie 3/10. I was expecting much more for this movie.",2023-10-26
"Despite the eight-year wait and the terrible theater etiquette that ruined the night, this film failed to deliver a MATURE story that has been long-anticipated by fansThe game's audience is more focused on the actual murders and animatronics, so why do we spend the entire film following a lethargic man and his sister? He wasn't even interesting; all he did throughout the film was beat a man half to death and sleep. The real disappointment is that Mike was overshadowed by the actual pizzeria, as in the location itself, not the history behind it, but simply seeing the actual location had more personality than Mike.My favorite part of the entire film was when they forgot Springtrap was the antagonist, so they threw him in the end to say ""I always come back"" and springtrapped all over Freddy!",2023-11-01
"If you have absolutely no idea about anything that takes place in the Five Nights at Freddy's games (lore and gameplay) then this is a great movie. However, the movie didn't portray many things that the games do.Gameplay-screenplay
There were some scenes where the Mike, the nightguard, was face to face with the animatronics during his shift. Not only is this not even close to how the game franchise is (specifically fnaf 1), the animatronics didn't scare, hurt, or kill the nightguard while they were face to face.I wish the nightguard scenes took place more in the office rather than roaming around. The cameras (which is a HUGE aspect in the games) were barely used.Some other things were different, too. Mike was able to electrocute the animatronics, which you can't do in the games, either.Lore
Yes, I know the lore was intended to be different entirely from the games and be its own thing, but some things should have been kept the same.Golden Freddy never appeared, which was a shame. It would have been hard to include him, however, since the movie didn't use cameras and Mike wasn't stuck in an office.Classic phone guy wasn't here! I mean, phone guy does have his own lore, but they could have just erased all that and had phone guy give instructions instead of the girl on the vhs.I won't go into family lore, but I wish that stayed the same at least. Or keep the William was Michael's dad, at least.All in all, it was a good movie. I had higher hopes as a huge fnaf fan, but it was good for what it's worth.",2023-10-27
"Five Nights at Freddy's is the new Blumhouse Horror based on a game.We meet Mike Schmidt, a down and out security guard who is the sole carer of his little Sister.He runs into animatronics mascots in the form of Teddy Bears whilst working at his job as a security guard at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. He soon realises that the establishment is not what it seems and the mascots have a super natural connection to past events in the town.Five Nights at Freddy's did not live up to my expectations. The tension never really built up during the film and many characters were over played such as the mean aunt. We also meet another key character part way through the film and it's very obvious that there is more to them than meets the eye. The film could have done a much better job of introducing and utilising this character.As the film progressed, I felt more like an outsider observing what was on screen as opposed to being engrossed in the movie. Whilst some scenes were exciting the large mascots, though unique, weren't the most menacing characters and the horror scenes left a lot to be desired. It also felt like there were gaps in the narrative.Overall I appreciate a nuisnced horror, that touched on loss, family and the super natural but the film failed to convince me from start to finish. Moreover, there were no real redeeming qualities whether it be the acting, humour or the antagonists.",2023-10-26
"Let us get this out of the way at the start? Is this meant to be a horror film? No. Does it need to be? No.I struggle to think of a single moment in this film that was genuinly scary. Even if I'm trying to put myself in the place of teen watching this I still can't imagine that I'd think it was scary.At the end of the day this movie doesn't need to be scary because it's really targeted at a younger audience that is gonna watch it primarily for the easter eggs. They want to see Freddy, Bonnie, Foxie and Chica in all their glory and in this department the special effects team absolutely nailed it. The feel and look of the animatronics was on point. I can't think of a single criticism in regards to them or their look. The fans want to see Springtrap enter the room and feel as though he's actually a threat and I think the movie succeeded in this as well. Sure, the ""I always come back"" line was forced and didn't really make sense in context but it's what the fans want and they got it.Overall this isn't a movie I'm going to come back to a lot but I'm still glad I watched it. I'm fine with the directors taking liberties with their story (Because the official story is a mess) but I still think the writing and pacing could've been better. That's why I'm only giving this a 4/10 rather than a 6/10.",2023-11-01
"Solid movie that DOES rely a lot on some prior investment in the franchise as a whole to truly ""get"". Non-fans might be left a bit in the dark and confused, and might find the story a bit lacking, where as those who have been with it since 2014 will be screaming in joy at all sorts of tiny winks and nods.A bit loose on the horror elements in favor of serving a different narrative from the source material, but not in a way that deters from the experience, rather in my opinion lets the movie stand on its own from the games. It's not a 1-to-1 adaption, and that probably serves it well.Absolutely worth the wait for FNAF-fans!",2023-10-27
"Unfortunately, the movie falls short in many ways. The acting is stiff, the script is predictable, and the visuals are mediocre at best. The plot is full of cliches and the jumpscares are mostly predictable. The characters are flat and two-dimensional, with little depth or background given to them. The pacing is uneven, with some parts dragging on for too long and others feeling rushed.The special effects are also a bit lacking, with some unrealistic and poorly executed creature designs that take away from the overall horror factor. The score and soundtrack are also unremarkable, with no memorable themes or cues that add to the tension or atmosphere of the movie.While the movie had potential, it sadly fails to deliver on most fronts. It's a mediocre attempt at a horror film that doesn't do anything new or exciting, and ultimately feels like a missed opportunity.Overall, I would give this movie a 4 out of 10 stars, as it's not a particularly memorable or successful horror film. While it may have its fans, it just doesn't measure up to some of the better films in the genre. It's a disappointing effort, to say the least.",2023-10-26

"I saw Five Nights at Freddy's, starring Josh Hutcherson-the Hunger Games movies, Red Dawn_2012; Piper Rubio-Unstable_tv, How We Roll_tv; Elizabeth Lail-Gossip Girl_tv, Once Upon a Time_tv and Matthew Lillard-the Scooby Doo movies, the Scream movies.This is a horror film based on a video game. Josh gets a job as a night security guard at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza Parlor-think Chuck E. Cheese-that has been closed down for years due to an incident. The gimmick at Freddy's was that they had animatronics that played music and danced. Matthew plays the man that owns the defunct business-he won't tear it down for sentimental reasons-and gives Josh the job. The incident that closed Freddy's down involved the disappearance of five kids and the trail led back to Freddy's but after a complete search, nobody was ever found in the building-hence, the shut down. Josh keeps dreaming about his own little brother that was kidnapped years earlier and soon starts to think that there might be some kind of connection to Freddy's incident. Piper is Josh's sister and Elizabeth is a police officer that informs Josh about the history of Freddy's. The movie does not use CGI, but instead, Jim Henson puppeteers handle most of the handiwork on the animatronics. There is a scene just after the end credits start but nothing at the very end.It's rated PG-13 for violence, bloody images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 50 minutes.If you know much about the video game-I don't-you will probably like it and it would be a good one to stream.",2023-10-28
"Where to start, such a let down, the worst possible adaptation of perhaps the best horror games of all time, so many unnecessary ""plot twists"", movie didn't even try following the original storyline off of game, so many unnecessary characters (aunt and her lawyer??) casting director should be fired, the employment agent suddenly became the ""Phone guy"" from the game, it's seems like the director made his own type of Fnaf that just doesn't connect to the original storyline, props to animations and looks tho. This could've been easily the greatest game adaptation but its not. Reactions of characters in the movie were just unrealistic and uncomfortable to watch. Such a shame knowing that the game is unique.",2023-10-26
"I have been a fan of Five Nights at Freddy's since, at the very latest, 2015. I've loved the games since I was 10. This movie has been my most anticipated movie for over four years. Every single scene has some allusion to a secret mini game or an inside fan joke, and the actors portray the faceless characters from the games so well. If you don't know a thing about the franchise, this will be a jumbled mess. I loved every part of it. Sure, it's a bit corny in some lines and scenes, particularly with some of the animatronic scenes, but my only complaint is that it took nine years to complete this movie due to so many rewrites and I wish it was just a bit longer. I'm anticipating the sequel being announced, but I'm worried that I wont really care for the franchise as much when I'm 28. Hopefully the sequel won't be stuck in development Hell like this movie.",2023-10-27
"Definitely a good movie but wasn't necessarily as horrifying as it could have been but that should have been expected with it being mainly aimed at a younger audience. The overall story though was definitely satisfying and tied very well with what is already established in existing media relating to the series, the main character, Mike, definitely has his issues but he is found redeemable through a number of ways. The animatronics are portrayed very well and the children that inhabit them are portrayed in the movie very respectfully to the source material. The movie could have had more visceral content but what it did do, it did well, even with staying within the film's PG-13 rating.",2023-10-28
"So I know the basic premise of FNAF but I have never looked up into the whole lore that there apparently is. So if there are any scenes in this movie that are based on this lore I didn't recognize them and so I can't give the movie credit for that. My rating is based on my very little knowledge of that basic FNAF game.At first I was really skeptical because the movie starts with an eye rolling scene where our protagonist beats up a man because he thinks that a young boy is being kidnapped and I immediately knew that it was the guy's son and this will play a role in the protagonists backstory. Talking about the backstory I am tired of the trope that a character has lived through something heartbreaking or feels guilt for something that he did. I don't know if there is any similar things in FNAF, but if there isn't then I don't know why they dragged this generic plot into this actually pretty unique movie.However I actually kind of enjoyed the movie overall and I think Mike's character is portrait really well by Josh Hutcherson. You empathize with him and even feel sorry for the situation he is in about his younger sister Abby with his aunt. I also really enjoyed the character of Vanessa and seeing Matthew Lillard in this was a pleasure as well. Also the animatronics look really good and the whole set was really true to detail and I think that fans will love that. There are some cheap jump scares but if there's one movie who is allowed to do that, then it's a movie about FNAF I guess.I think the movie ended up decent and was enjoyable for a one time watch but on the other hand I think with this unique setup they could have made so much more and the movie ended up not being able to stand out enough to be remembered as a classic. [6,3/10]",2023-11-02
"The film's greatest strength is its atmosphere. Director Chris Columbus perfectly captures the eerie and claustrophobic feeling of the games. The pizzeria is a dark and labyrinthine place, and the animatronics are genuinely unsettling. Columbus also makes excellent use of sound design to create a sense of dread. Every creak and groan is amplified, and the animatronics' movements are accompanied by eerie metallic noises.The performances are also strong. Scott Cawthon, the creator of the video games, has a cameo as a police officer, and Ethan Hawke is perfectly cast as Mike Schmidt. Hawke brings a believable sense of vulnerability and determination to the role.The film is not without its flaws. The pacing is a bit slow in the first half, and the plot is fairly predictable. However, the film's atmosphere and scares more than make up for its shortcomings.Overall, Five Nights at Freddy's is a must-see for fans of the video games and horror films in general. It is a well-made and terrifying film that will stay with you long after you leave.The movie was great and william afton really did a great actor job.I really liked the opening credits and the springlock scene it was amazing.",2023-10-27
"Big fan of the games, went in with super low expectations because of all the critic reviews, but it completely blew me out of the water! Don't expect the movie to be a masterpiece of cinema, but in terms of simple, fun horror, this movie does it right. I was a bit disappointed when I first heard the movie would be pg 13, but this is exactly the right amount of gore for a FNAF movie. It manages to have horrifying kills without being overly graphic. It's also pretty faithful to the games, which is a huge plus in my opinion. The characters have some iffy motives, but that can easily be overlooked just for plot progression. Really hoping we get more FNAF movies!",2023-10-27
"NOT a B-movie for sure, but nevertheless failing to make a lasting impression or make ANY impression whatsoever...The bad; if you want to be horrified or thrilled dont watch this movie, because it truly has NO horror or thrill. I dont know whose the target audience for this movie, because it is PG-13, but I cant imagine for a second that any teenager is gonna get scared or excited about his lame story.Not any good then? All the technical details (photography, sound) are good. The acting performances (by unknowns) are good as well. As I started out saying, this movie aint rubbish, it merely fails to really excite or thrill.",2023-10-28
"As a Fnaf fan for many years, I was very disappointed. I felt like the movie itself didn't follow the game that we all know and love. Like, how most of the story/plot was about (Mike) brother being kidnapped and him trying to find out who did it. The fact that the security guard (Mike) slept throughout most of the nights, instead of watching the security cameras to see if the animatonics moved was very upsetting. When Mike slept, the ghost of the children will come to him in his sleep and hurt him. Also, that when the animatonics was fighting the bad guys it was in bright daylight, but in the games they only start moving at night. There's many different things that made me confused and I didn't like.However, there was some good part. First, I'll like to say the acting in this movie is kinda cheesy. But, the acting being cheesy made the movie funnier. The Chica's cupcake really made the movie good and it gave me the action I was looking for in this movie. Furthermore, I'll like to give props to the people that made the animatonics suits. They're so well made and neat. Before I watch the movie seeing the video of people touching and hugging the animatonics really really made me happy.In the end, the movie in my eyes was OK. I had very high hopes that it will be good and I think that was my biggest mistake. With it being Pg- 13, probably made the movie less scary. Even though it was pg, the movie in some parts were very boring. One of my friends slept through the movie that how boring it was. But, watch the movie yourself. My opinion shouldn't make you second guess if you'll like it or not. It just I feel like it was a waste of money that I could've use for food or something. Anyways thanks for reading my review.",2023-10-28
"My oldest knows about the FNAF game and books. She was excited about the idea of a movie so we just watched ot together. A lot of people are complaining about the movie and she was a little bummed by that. She was very satisfied with the movie itself. She thought it went along pretty well with the original FNAF. She did comment about it being a bit tamer than some of the online content she has watched. They made a few chances as to how some things happened in the story line as well. Then again what movie follows a game or book exactally when they make it any way? Honestly, as long as people who are familiar with FNAF are satisfied like she was then who needs the gory aspects to be elevated. It was a decent story line with relatable characters and a decent spook factor. You could easily take someone who isn't a horrer/thriller fan to this and they could handle watching it with you and not miss a lot of sleep in the end.",2023-10-28
"If you came into this movie only knowing this franchise as ""evil robots that kill security guy"", you will probably be confused/dislike this movie. With plenty of direct references to the game, if you're a devoted fan like myself you'll definitely enjoy it. There are a few crossing paths/twisting of the lore that may seem like a nuisance but are understandable considering they didn't want it to be completely copy paste of the games. But still held up to pleasing fans as they said they would. This movie doesn't really have a distinct genre, more just dabbling into light horror and blunt comedy, and not too gory with the PG-13 rating. I feel like too many people wanted it to be a slaughter fest / slasher, even when that's not really shown out in the games. And considering the kids were already dead, there was no need to show that happening.My only gripes were how expansive the dream theory got, and the idea that the children's spirits didn't know William killed them. I just figured the dream theory being shown so early was a reference to one of the earliest fan theory names. But was to a point where I actually said to myself ""alright this is enough"" with how many times we saw Mike's dreams. And about the spirits, if they knew William captured/killed Garrett, why would they not know how they were killed? If you completely cut out the idea that the kids saw William as some overlord to them and always knew he was evil, nothing would change. They could still recognize and attack him on night 5 as they did since that's the only night he showed up.Jumpscares were adequate, saying this as a fan of the franchise none of them actually scared me, but I still liked to see it. However the hand one seemed to be slower than it appeared in the trailer.I liked the new idea they took with the animatronics actually being childlike considering they are child spirits, not just permanent suffering as they are in the games/lore. Cutesy addition that didn't really do any major plot damage.The reveal of Vanessa being William's daughter was kinda weak, as this is a major lore difference, and also a cheap plot fill, as I was hoping she would have her real name exposed as Elizabeth, only appearing as Vanessa due to the recent game, but to no avail. Also makes her character come off as unintentional evil/incredibly ignorant for hiding and conforming to her dad's secret.To wrap up I like how they stayed true to the child spirits surrounding William as he is springlocked, and locked away, setting up the potential trilogy that was proposed.As a longtime and deeply devoted fan, I enjoyed this. Ignoring the lore changes it still could've been better, but wasn't horrendous. I just think too many people were expecting this to be a slasher-esque movie, and will be disappointed to see it was heavily story based.",2023-10-27
"This movie doesn't deserve the time it takes to even write this. I'd rather watch Five Nights at Domino's Pizza. Pointless plot elements, endless drivel. When you consider the lore of these games and this story, you'll wonder what the creator is like at parties. Creepy, and not the kind of creepy found in many, many horror movies throughout cinema history. More like creepy .... Hey man, let's check your refrigerator for severed heads. My kids didn't like this movie either... Because, as any self respecting parent would do, I've already shown them proper scary movies like John Carpenter's The Thing. Thank the cinema gods for putting them on the right path.",2023-10-31
"Great movie. Yes, it's a movie so it's not exactly like the movies obviously and it basically combined games 1 and 2. Parts of the third game. I really can't review this without mentioning the games because of references. The biggest problem is Vanessa. Mike was supposed to be William Afton's son Michael Afton. Instead we got Vanessa Afton. The moment Springtrap appeared I just gasped. Knowing Scott this is to stir the pot. Maybe Michael was in the whole game series just the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. Yes, rules say not to refer to other content but this movie cannot be really reviewed without reference to the games. I bet the changes were done on purpose. Scott Cawthon likes to make us work to figure out the story details.",2023-10-27
"Five Nights at Freddy's is a highly anticipated film for fans of game the series, and as an old fan I couldn't miss it. There have been problems since its announcement in 2015, but the film is finally released. However, despite expectations, it does not deliver fear and tension, although the actors perform well. It's a shame that not all of the game's theories came to fruition, and the movie isn't appropriate for Halloween. New fans might enjoy it, but for me, a fan of the game, it was a disappointment. 7 out of 10 for the nostalgic music of the first part song The Living Tombstone at the end of the credits.",2023-10-31
"Ive been a fan of FNAF for some years now and ive always liked the atmosphere, the lore, the plot in the games and the really well made horror ambience the games brought me throughout the years. And i have waited for this film for a long time. So i really hoped this film could bring me that aswell.For me as a longtime FNAF fan, It truly gave me a nostalgic type of feeling. Loved the atmosphere!It has a really good and well made story close to the games. It actually really succeeds with feeling genuine.The atmosphere is great and really holds the same quality as the games!Great acting and great manuscript!The resturant and the animatronics are really well made!Great lore and eastereggs!If you are a fan of the franchise you really are going to enjoy this great film!A must see if your a FNAF fan! Loved the vibe and ambiance it gave me! Its really a film made with passion and it wants to give the fans a genuine cinematic experience! Seeing it on the big screen feels just unbelievable!I truly recommend it!! And im not saying it only because i love the games, but because its a well made, very well put together and well acted.Really nice soundtrack that really fits the ambience of the film!One of the best horrorfilms ive seen on the cinema for a very long time!Really hope for a sequence and fnaf attractions around the world.",2023-10-31
"It was nothing like the games and was all over the shop, how was Vanessa in it and how was she Aftons daughter and not Mike like in the games, there was barely and jump scares, the only one that actually worked was a door opening and that wasn't meant to be scary. And what was the backstory of micheal? Where was the bite??? I was very disappointed in the acting as well, Mathew lillard and Hutchens were the only good actors in this entire movie and Lillard was in it for like 10 mins!!! Where was the build up to the reveal??? Where was Henry??? Where was the backstory on the kids who went missing and Emily Henry. Where was she???",2023-10-26
"This movie was the best I've ever seen, liked a lot of appearances, movie was good and liked a it of the characters in the movie. The jokes were funny at some points, the story was amazing, and the people who made this movie did great.The credit for the song was also good maybe because I've been a fnaf fan since it came out but it was good to re listen to a classicThe spring lock scene was also pretty good, the ending was also good and that i like how they got the line from ucn/ultimate custom night here.And the last thing is that the kills could be a bit better but the best one was the one with Freddy biting off half of the babysitters body. But yeah perfect movie in my opinion.",2023-10-27
"It has a surprisingly good story and heart that you can tell has so much love for the games! Easter eggs are everywhere and the Die hards fans will love finding them, but the flaws are apparent. Tone can be messy and might get a little to slow at times but never enough to impacted the movie. Story isn't too Accessible to people unfamiliar with the games, and the dialog isn't always the best. But fans of the series will without a doubt have so much fun watching this on the big screen after 8 whole years of development hell. Its not perfect in the slightest. However, I still loved the movie and can't wait to watch it again!",2023-10-27
"I've been a fan of the franchise since 2015 and had VERY high expectations for this movie and I've got to say, I'm VERY impressed with the film. Although I found a few scenes a bit cheesy, I enjoyed watching and they kept hold of my attention.The 15 rating does hold back on jumpscares and gore but they managed to work with the rating to make the film the best it could be!All of the character were amazingly performed and none of them were unpleasant to watch!And I've just got to mention the animatronics, WOW, they look AMAZING and were actually made in real life which is just crazy.Thank you very much to Blumhouse and Universal for giving us such a great film!",2023-10-28
"I would say it is an 8 but the rating of 6/10 is way to low. Similarly to the low critic score originally on the mario movie, this is not a movie for the critic. I see other reviews say that there is no blood in the movie but this is not true, there is some blood shown in the shadows in the 'bite of 23' scene,and any other blood in the movie is in the form of small injuries. I enjoyed the matpat and Cory cameos, and the sparky the dog reference was great, along with Carl the cupcake killing a guy called Carl. The overall horror of the movie is low as the animatronics are seen in a playful and kind way near Abby.Story 7/10
Scares 3/10
Animatronic design 10/10
Acting 9/10.",2023-10-27
"The FNAF movie stays true to the characters and lore. As a veteran FNAF fan, this is exactly what I wanted out of it and I loved all the Easter eggs and the actors performances. I agree that there were less jumpscares and blood than I expected, but it was a perfect amount to keep the movie still have the amazing horror elements.Matthew Lillard's performance was amazing and even though he didn't have a lot of screen time he certainly stole the show when he was on screen. I am so happy to see him come back to the horror genre, especially with one of the best movies adapted from a video game. All the actors were casted very nicely and I found all their personalities very likable. I loved the plot and its story.The FNAF movie is an enjoyable and fun experience for veterans and newcomers of the fandom. Even though the storyline changed from the original video game series it doesn't make the movie any less enjoyable, and I believe that a change in storyline was needed to make the video game franchise adaptable for the silver screen. The movie had lots of good songs and I enjoyed the soundtrack although it was a bit underwhelming.It shouldn't have such a low rating. The movie meets all my expectations and more. People are being too harsh on the movie and shouldn't expect everything to be the same as in the games. Critics are just being stupid with their reviews as my friends and I who are all veterans of the FNAF fandom were absolutely delighted with the movie and all had a great time finding Easter eggs, references, and thoroughly enjoyed the plot.",2023-10-27
"Movie of the year 2023. That was absolutely fantastic, and a huge redeeming grace to Blumhouse, seems they put a lot of their time and effort in perfecting this movie. As someone who already knew the lore, this is very loyal to it! Premiere day, we all lost our minds. Screaming and laughing and ""ooh""s all around the board. Cool as almost anything. Bound to become a future cult classic, for sure. Animatronics were so good that I didn't realize they were puppets and love actors (besides W. Afton.) Crazy and gory for PG-13, not huge gore though. Single swear, was fun. All I wished was that W's death was as traumatizing as the games. I get you can't do that with PG-13, and the out-of-this-world amount of references to the series (from a FNAF book, to the drawings, to MatPat jokes, to posters), I think it makes its artistic license twists really well, making it separate from other FNAF installations in its own special way with its story while still making it worthy of being Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Got good comedy, good drama, and...inconsistent setting. Add that all to a very cool pixel fun title card, a pretty sick soundtrack, cool lighting, and THE LIVING TOMBSTONE AS A END TUNE?!? YEAH!!!!!!!",2023-10-28
"LIKES:The Graphics Are Decent
-It's a movie about bringing robots to life, and they did a great job of doing just that, but sticking to the spirit of the game.-This film has the robots looking like metallic behemoths with frozen faces changed only by limited motor movements, and yet keeps the fluffiness of the mascots of the franchise.-Certainly it's not the most realistic looking piece of equipment, but it works with the franchise looks.-And seeing them move and enact their ploys on the human patrons, is very much in touch with what Cawthon drummed up all those years ago, and keeping to the cartoony finishes for the most part.The Acting:
-I can't say it's the strongest, most unique, or really stuck in the line of so bad it's good. This movie's cast does a good mob, it's just a moderate role with good execution.-Hutcherson actually feels like his Hunger Game roles, that sad dopy, and haunted look playing so well with his pouting, screaming, and anguish that his character has.-Rubio is wonderful with the performance, awkward, odd, but innocent a perfect contradicting optimism that cuts through the grey of this movie, and really explodes as the movie presses on and she gets further into the mystery.-Lail is okay for me. There are moments where she shines and has depth, and much of the time seems a little flat, relying on some more of the ""action"" to deliver what she can deliver.-It works to have characters that dive into the heart of the material and what people want, and for the most part is a fine addition to what I expected this movie to be.Good Pacing:
-For what this movie is trying to accomplish, the pace is actually rather impressive in terms of the age ranges it is trying to entertain.-FNAF's story in this iteration may be simple, but you find that you are presented with a lot of good information and elements with decent time in each, without losing momentum.-With plenty of time to give to both human and animatronics, this film was able to keep the various members entertained and not get lost in the added theatrics that are often seen in the books.-And I felt that I never wavered from the FNAF lore or gimmicks this movie was expected to have.Funny:
-It's a campy series and has a lot of twisted humor styles that most should enjoy and expect to have in this series.-One level is how cheesy a movie version is, more so the idiocy of the humans and just how humorous the animatronics are in this rendition.-Other times the expressions and personalities of the robots are hilarious, the emotions and the blending with the robotic nature are just so well-executed that I couldn't help but laugh at their use.-As expected, the movie also sometimes is funny even when it's not trying to be, because of how cheesy it is or ridiculous the acting/scene comes out to be.Great Music... for the Movie
-It's a minor like for most, but I loved the track selection and just how fitting into the 80s vibe it goes to set the moment.-The tinny sounding tones of the synthesizer, the upbeat bass with flashing lights and whistles, and even that hyperactive voice all work together and somehow tell a story with it.-But At the same time there is the FNAF brand of music in what sound like Tim Burton inspired tracks, with eerie tingles, that offsetting string sound, and the deep resonance to indicate ominous happenings.-And the end credit song won points from me too, and I really enjoyed the blending of the words to go with the aspect of the movie.The Setting:
-It's trying to find the footing in the timeframe of the games, which means going back in time and they accomplished the look of the decade with it.-Clothes and outfits are limited in this one, but the pizzeria itself was beautiful at what they accomplished in reviving the excitement of the venue.-But always adding that ambience of horror with it, the abandoned feel, making it a playground of particularly petrifying putridness come out in all the glory, but keeping it kid friendly of course.The Story:
-It's more direct than the games, which can be good or bad, but FNAF the movie has several stories trying to be worked in and connected.-The main story feels decently fleshed out, tying most of the leads together and adding personalization to include Mike's character beyond trying to survive.-Fans of the franchise will still get there classic story, and sticks decently close to the original, with a few tweaks to adapt to this story, and the calling cards with it.-And there is another story that jumps the gun and shakes things up, potentially mixing up the theories to come, but again makes the inclusion of a character worth it.-All in all, the stories are nothing majorly special, but decent in blending tradition and new twists in my opinion.Fan Service:
-My favorite part, is of course the fan service built into the movie, not just the story, but the Easter eggs in the film.=The opening credits alone show you what is coming, but the roving eyes will find pictures, props, and plenty of things to get excited about as you wonder if they'll do more.-Cameos are heavy, plot elements are hinted, there are background pieces with whispers of what is to come, and even an end credit hit that should please many fans. It all comes together without getting in the way of the new and the story, and I really liked that.DISLIKES:Predictable:
-The movie is horribly predictable. A Syfy element that feels cheesy and lax, the story needed something more than sticking to the games.-Those who know the big bad villain will figure out all the twists right away, and the inclusion/revelation is rather mundane, with only the younger audience potentially blown away.-In addition, the story just needs more oomph and some of the plot elements could have been tapered or forgotten in favor of building up the other elements.More Mystery Element Needed:
-The game series was all about figuring out connections and deciphering layers to come up with the story.-While I like a more direct plot, the uncovering of the truth, the discovery, and the personality of many characters and elements needed that pop.-Maybe in a sequel, but this movie just felt so rushed to get to the shock values and mystery, that the detective work felt too easy and obvious to really be worth the effort.-And even the elements of adding those teaser layers could have gone a long way, but we already have about three games crammed into one story wise, and that makes me think it was a bit too mashed together.Not Scary:
-Horror movies got to have that bite to stick, and this movie did not even touch the scare factor for me and my buddy, more of the thriller.-It is censored for the key demographic, and I respect it on that level, but the entertainment value and edge gets dropped quickly without that scare element.-All the ""hunting"" for lack of a better word is stiff, the fight too short lived, and even the attacks themselves are often off camera, and when on point phony to an erroring degree.-Without that suspense, this movie is funny and cute, but rather boring at the same time and thus, not the Halloween movie they were aim to achieve.The VERDICT:
Five Nights at Freddy's had a lot of things to live up to for success and I think it does achieve this on many levels. My personal favorite portions are the recreation of the decade in sound and sight, unleashing a world that feels realistic, historical, campy, and fitting of the very universe created by the games. A story that might not be unique, but still has a good pace and ties many things together, with tradition and new age mixing well together to once more craft something for many fans. Yet, it's the fan service that will win for most, that campy cartoon look brought to life, and playing well with the actors to make something for the prime audience members to enjoy and that was great. However, the modern age and limitations of the film buffered the horror aspects and made the movie lacking in terms of that Halloween spirit I wanted. It's cute factor robs the movie of that dark and dismal bite this franchise thrives on, and with it the mystery element that is the lifeblood of this series. With predictable twists and lacking the thrills, this movie suffers to live up to the danger that each game always has. With all this, my scores are:Horror/Mystery/Thriller: 6.5
Movie Overall: 6.0.",2023-10-27
"So on may I watched the Mario movie. I liked it but I know nothing of Mario so I never got to experience ""ITS THE THING"" type scenario.But then came another video game adaptation; The FnaF movie. I was excited yes but I was a little sceptical and worried it wouldn't be what I expected. BUT BOY WAS I WRONG!!!!!!It was FANTASTIC! I finally got to experience ""ITS THE THING"" I got reference after reference. Like there was a ""It's me"" written on a mirror, and..... Ladies, Gentlemen and Gentlethem..... WE GOT A
MAT PAT CAMEO!Not only that the story was really compelling. I was leaning forward the whole time wondering what would happen next!But the best part about it was the ending. We got the spring lock scene we wanted and, he even said THE LINE; ""I always come back"".But overall it is the perfect movie for FnaF fans and they made sure it was compelling for them. Keep in mind that this is a really picky fandom so YOU KNOW ITS GOOD!Thank you for your time.",2023-10-28
"The Five Nights at Freddy's movie is actually very good and scary. Everyone was acting well, and this universe felt like reality. It's pretty hard to talk about without spoiling, but I think you'll like this if you watch it. Especially the FNAF fans. In my opinion it should be rated R for the content in the movie, It is pretty graphic, but that is honestly, something I respected and feared about the movie while watching, It was very tense, and I didn't predict most things that happened in the movie.

"People are very picky nowadays, they can't just have some fun at a family horror film, the movie is incredible, it's fun, it's scary some times and it's a bit sad, don't expect something exactly from the game sor the books, just have a set and enjoy the movie. The movie was made for the fans, but I brought my mother to the Theater and she loved it, even though she never played the games, different from most horror movies, this one has a very interesting storyline that keep you entertained, not so many ""jumpscares"" I or you would expect, but hey, it's a nice movie, bring your whole family to watch it, almost no gore, but that's not a problem, things still very implicit.",2023-10-27
"Quick Review as an adult who was forced to go cuz 2 of my kids REALLY wanted to see this movie:(tl;dr: if you just want to know if it's good enough to go see, yes, it's good enough, it was better than I expected - just remember it's a preteen/early teen video game adaptation so somethings are a bit off, aside from that, it's a chill/solid movie)The Pro's:UPFRONT: The overall underlying story is horrifying as a parent see, and gut-wrenching to watch play out. What happens to the main character is every parents WORST nightmare. This movie was filmed/directed in an incredible fashion, so much so that I can say that it was beautifully done. I'm not big on the horror genre, but damn this movie really had me incredibly worried most of the time.1) The main character Mike (Josh Hutcherson) ABSOLUTELY CARRIES THIS MOVIE. From the beginning to end, his performance is INSANELY GOOD. His back must hurt from carrying this movie on his back. SEVERAL times his performance made me tear up; his back story is soul crushing. Other topics surrounding him are also very hard to witness.2) Matthew Lillard (Steve/William) is in this movie in a few scenes, but DAMN when he's on it, HIS PERFORMANCE IS INTENSE!!! I can't say much more because of spoilers if I were to describe his performance. We need more of Mr. Lillard in horror/suspense films, man this dude can be intense.3) the majority of the rest of the characters in this movie do their job well and keep it going.The cons:
1) Vanessa (Elizabeth Lail): The writers could have done a better job with 2 major things:
a)Her background as a cop was terrible. If she would have been a weekly maintenance person or something along those lines, it would have made it more believable as every time her character stepped on screen, all I thought of was ""you're a cop, you shouldn't be doing any of this"".B) Her dialogue was lazy. Look as an actress she did the best with what she was given so this has NOTHING to do against her, but man, they did her a huge disservice with her dialogue.2) The first scene of the movie with security guard made some comically bad decisions that initially made me feel that the movie was guna be bad. However his fate was intense to watch so I suppose that made up for itOverall:
It's a solid watchable movie. Aside from Vanessa's character, the actors and actresses did an incredible job and the directing/camera angles and shots were very well put together.",2023-10-27
"Personally, I myself really LOVED this movie . I thought it had some cool Easter eggs and moments that pay homage to the game. IMO as well the practical effects were pretty well done. The animatronics were incredible! I have never played the games physically for myself but had been heavily into gameplay watch of all the games from various YouTubers namely mark though and had kept up with and always looked toward to ALL the lore videos from matpat. I had been waiting for this for a long time . I know many people will talk about a lot of things this movie wasn't but I loved this for everything it WAS and I had a good time with it . Give it a try and see what u think !",2023-10-30
"You definitely have to go in understanding what you're about to watch. To someone like me - a fan of the video games since the very first came out nearly a decade ago - the references and jokes made me cheer in my seat every time. To keep this as spoiler free as possible: it follows the lore relatively well and adds a few good twists int here to make it feel unique.Only complaint is that... i REALLY wish this was rated r. A couple of scenes could have been SO much cooler with a gorier touch. I was ten when the very first game came out, and now that i'm 20 (and traumatized), i was REALLY hoping to see a certain scene be way gorier than it actually was. Good scene with great cinematography, but i wanted to watch blood pour out and that just... did not happen.So: great if you know the lore, probably really confusing if you don't, and deserved to be way bloodier than it was.",2023-10-28
"In an attempt to provide for his younger sister Abby, Mike accepts a job as a security guard at an old theme restaurant throughout the night. Sadly for him, the animatronic attractions there have a tendency toward homicide and are constantly on the lookout for fresh victims.It's interesting to see an official adaptation that takes a completely different turn after watching an unofficial, extremely bloody movie that was inspired by the video game Five Nights at Freddy's in Willy's Wonderland two years ago. The adaptation that director Emma Tammi and game developer Scott Cawthon (who also serves as writer and producer) have given us focuses more on the mythos and drama of the games than on the violence and death caused by animatronic robots. Though it's not a bad idea per se, the video game adaption is disappointingly restrained.If the low-key, character-first approach wasn't apparent from the previous screenwriters associated to the project, Josh Hutcherson's involvement should have eliminated any doubt about it. As it turns out, Hutcherson plays Mike, who is preoccupied with the kidnapping of his younger brother years ago and finds it difficult to maintain a work in order to support his sister Abby. Reluctantly, he accepts a position as a night watchman at a closed restaurant where enormous animatronic characters lurk in shadowy areas and murder the occasional patron. The only local police officer to advise him to avoid the area is Vanessa, but she won't reveal why at first.The fact that Mike largely ignores the creatures and is blissfully ignorant of their menace for the majority of the film is what makes it different. Though he is frightened by the enormous beasts, his primary concern is trying to decipher lucid dreams regarding his brother's death. Except for a few brief sequences, Tammi also seems more interested in exploring the philosophical issues of what is causing these robots to come to life and why they might kill than she does in being splattered.That's not always a bad thing, but until very late in the movie, Mike becomes a witness to events. Maybe that's implied by the title, but it breaks the suspense in the movie by putting the hero and the monster at odds with one other. Hutcherson gives a strong performance, and there are enough jump scares to keep you fascinated, but overall, this seems like more of a one-night event.",2023-10-30
"As a FNAF fan who's been around since 2014, I was super pleased to see nods to the games, content creators, and theories, plus view interesting things to question for the lore. Suit accuracy is probably the best thing they had going. The pacing wasn't great, the story tone wasn't there. Steve Raglan's performance as SpringBonnie/ William Afton was mid(not good or bad), the souls I feel had a lost sense of direction. They somehow managed to add a goofy scene to this horrific story (as in fnaf lore is scary and grueling). The jump scares weren't even remotely great. If you even consider those jump-scares. Being pg-13 already watered it down heavily but even for pg-13 this was pretty bad. The Living Tombstone FNAF song being officially the FNAF song warmed my saddened heart. I really dislike the diluted direction the franchise is taking. We're kinda loosing the horror aspect. Sure in writing everything is scary but it hasn't been displayed all that well. Catering this movie to kids or younger audience might help the profit but it's making the story so much worse. Because FNAF was never supposed to be pg13. So I give this movie a 6/10. Really disappointed.",2023-10-26
"This review will not be spoiler free so please be warned before reading onThe film started out ok, but the film soon began to drag out, having played the games I was expecting a lot more from this film, but I was left very disappointed with the results, having the games to hype this film up might be its biggest fall other than the bad acting, terrible script and just straight up lack of horror and gore, it's a simple mess in the park and does not live up to the hype of a film that was rumoured to be an outstanding horror film.The characters looked far too CGI and they just felt underwhelming to what the games have shown them to be, with seeing Matthew Lillard on the big screen was a nice thing as I don't believe I've seen him in the cinema before apart from the scooby doo movies, the film was about 30 minutes too long, one good thing I liked was the sound, the sound design was outstanding with the correct music choses to the sound of the toys and the way that its very horror like to have random noises being played with no reason as to why but this film shows that.Five Nights at Freddy's let me down with the age rating, It's a 15 but feels like it's a 12, the amount of times we had things leaking up to an actual on screen death and then blank, we don't see what happens, we only hear and it's a massive let down because the film was not even scary, to me it was more of a comedy, having seen Saw X and loving all the Saw films I was kind of expecting not that level of gore but at the same time not the level or I should say lack of level of gore in FNAF, Having more outside of the FNAF world was strange and boring, the film felt like it was just trying to spread out the time before Mike goes to work but it was lacklustre, the story never went anywhere, the kids in the park were boring, underwhelming and just lazy writing, I feel like this film might actually be a kick in the face to the die hard FNAF fans and that is also down to I believe the rushed film, it was very rushed for my liking, compared to other horror films I've seen I honestly just felt let down and annoyed by the way they decided to take this film.This film felt like a child horror film, the jump scares that were in the film were lame and boring, obvious and just simply bad, the film had no real indemnity other than the names and characters, this film had potential to be good but its just a big mess with plot holes and bad acting all over the place, the script felt rushed and far too cringey, way too much real life stuff for this film, too much time in the real world rather than in the fast food chain and for me this film is a 3 out of 10, unfortunately it just didn't live up to the hype it was meant to, and I'm disappointed, I hope there won't be any more but if there is I hope that its done better and make it an 18 so we can get the gore and show what these characters can really do instead of leading us to see it then BAM no shots of what happens only sounds.",2023-10-26
"The five nights at Freddy's movie, that is based on the FNAF games, wasn't based on them at all.I can understand if the movie wouldn't be according to the fan built lore, but it was not even based on the events that happened in the fnaf games.The movie included some good scenes but overall it was too childish, which ruined whole fnaf concept.Scott had the tools to make a great horror film and decided to throw it away and make this childish movie that isn't even for children, I think it could be better to not make the movie at all to leave the story how it is, even if this movie isn't supposed to match the lore or be apart of it, for me, it ruined the concept of fnaf.I'm really disappointed of this movie and I hope we'll get a real horror fnaf film in the future.",2023-10-29
"With this movie, I have waited nine years and I have been through chanting of the theme song by 14-13 year olds in the cinema too mashed up dialogue. Why I have rated this movie a low score is because how it's lack of authenticity within comparison to the game, adding on the fact, the sister protagonist was very annoying. Like myself, I have just recently turned into an adult and I am not a film critic, but Jesus was this flop of an adaptation, considering I had been playing FNAF games since their release, versus kids fanning over the cringe worthy lore (mixing lore with cringe memes);
Not even considering they were just toddlers at the time, and most fans were around 10 years old, even though those kids probably only recently heard about it (one or two years ago).Example: Five Nights at Freddy's Security Breach (But Vanessa) it was funny at first, but quickly got cringe. The moral of the story is don't make a movie about a game, unless it's authentic and enjoyable to watch without kids screaming over the movie on how the film was ""so good""!",2023-10-26
"Five Nights at Freddy's (FNAF), the popular video game series created by Scott Cawthon, has enthralled players with its intricate lore and mysterious narrative for years. The franchise has grown to include books, merchandise, and even a highly anticipated movie adaptation. However, for those well-versed in the FNAF lore, the film's was a significant letdown.The FNAF community, with its deep understanding of the game's lore, eagerly anticipated the movie as a chance to explore the rich and enigmatic world they've come to love. The games have consistently offered a complex narrative, filled with layers of mystery and horror, and fans were hopeful that the film would faithfully translate this storytelling into a visual medium. Unfortunately, the movie struggled to capture the essence of what made FNAF so captivating.The animatronics, despite their impressive craftsmanship, lacked the terrifying presence that fans expected. It felt like the filmmakers attempted to cater to a younger, broader audience by aiming for an M rating, which resulted in toned-down scares and a less menacing portrayal of these iconic characters. This decision left fans craving the spine-chilling horror that the FNAF franchise is renowned for, and the film's attempt to make it more kid-friendly ultimately detracted from its effectiveness.Where the movie faltered was in its plot and storytelling. The FNAF lore is renowned for its intricacy, with layers of hidden secrets and a timeline that fans have painstakingly pieced together over the years. This depth and complexity have been central to the series' success, and fans were eager to see it explored further in the movie adaptation. Unfortunately, the film fell short in this regard.The plot felt rushed and lacked the depth needed to do justice to the FNAF lore. It seemed as though the filmmakers were trying to condense a rich and expansive narrative into a two-hour movie, resulting in a story that felt fragmented and incomplete. Characters were introduced and discarded without much development, leaving the audience feeling disconnected from their struggles.Furthermore, the movie's pacing was inconsistent. It alternated between moments of tension and slow, almost monotonous scenes that failed to maintain the audience's engagement. For fans who were accustomed to the suspenseful gameplay of the FNAF series, the movie's pacing was a major letdown.The FNAF lore is not only about jump scares and terrifying animatronics; it's about understanding the dark history of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza and the tragic events that unfolded within its walls. Fans were hoping for a narrative that would delve into these intricate details and provide a deeper understanding of the lore. Regrettably, the movie barely scratched the surface, leaving many questions unanswered.The missed opportunity to explore the FNAF lore in depth was particularly disappointing. The games have left fans with numerous unsolved mysteries, hidden Easter eggs, and a complex timeline that could have translated into an engrossing cinematic experience. Instead, the film seemed more concerned with superficial scares and bad jump-scare moments that failed to induce any genuine fear. As someone well-versed in the FNAF lore, I couldn't help but feel that the film missed the mark when it came to delivering the spine-tingling terror that the games are known for. The jump scares were predictable and lacked the element of surprise that makes them truly unsettling. The result was a movie that left me, and likely many other fans, unimpressed and unscathed by the supposed horror.It's essential to recognize that adapting a video game with such a rich lore to a movie is a daunting task. However, previous successful adaptations, like the ""Silent Hill"" movie, have demonstrated that it's possible to capture the essence of a game's narrative. The FNAF movie's letdown was not due to a lack of potential but rather a failure to harness the full scope of the source material.In conclusion, the ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" movie left fans who intimately understood the lore feeling disheartened. The film failed to deliver the depth and complexity that the FNAF lore is known for. It missed the opportunity to dive into the rich storytelling that the games have meticulously constructed over the years. For FNAF enthusiasts, the film's release was a significant letdown, and the hope remains that future adaptations may more faithfully capture the essence of this beloved franchise.",2023-10-27
Went to see this with my son who has been a die hard Fnaf fan for some time. I had high expectations and was prepared to be scared....... however the reality was somewhat different. The plot lacked any depth and there was more questions at the end unanswered. Plot holes Galore and it really lacked any decent jump scares. It didn't induce the tension one was expecting or even hoping for before trying to deliver what we're very mild jump scares. My son was left disappointed and I was left truly feeling old.. if this is what the youth of today have for horror I feel sorry for them. Bring back truly horrifying stuff that is scary on a psychological level which I'm sure this was trying to achieve but missed the mark.,2023-10-26
"But it still wasnt anything too special, unfortunately. To be fair the game does have some good preformances (even from the child actor who played abby) and theres some interesting cinematography, but thats pretty much it. The characters seem to just accept the unusual nature of the events that happen to them without really questioning anything. They just kinda accept it and treat it as the most normal thing in the world. Theres also a completely pointless side plot about abbys aunt trying to take custody of her so that she can get free child support cheques or something that never really equates to anything. They could have just cut that part out and the movie would be mostly unaffected. At the very least i was kinda hoping that the movie would expand upon the FNAF lore and progress the story of it, but from what i can tell im pretty sure this movie wants to disconnect itself from the games and be its own story
it was difinitely a movie that FELT like fnaf, it had a lot of references and cameos and stuff, but overall the movie just fell a little flat in the end.",2023-10-28
"I have been a massive FNAF fan since elementary school. I was very excited and nervous about this movie, and I am happy to say it BLEW ME AWAY!There's a lot of negativity about the lack of scariness and jumpscares, and while it is lacking in that department, there's a reason. The fear in FNAF is the suspense. That can't be replicated in a non game format. By instead focusing on the story and the characters, it feels more genuine. Jumpscares in the movie would feel out of place and tacky.There was found family, character growth, amazing exposition, and lovable characters. It was amazing seeing my favorite animatronics from childhood brought to life so magnificently. The movie feels very loved and well researched.",2023-10-28
"Honestly, I was really worried when all these poor reviews started to come out. I shouldn't have been. I think we should all be aware by now that most of the time when critics rate something poorly, it means something is going right.I will admit there was maybe one moment where it got a little slow but apart from that I enjoyed all of it. Yes there are some parts in which you are gonna have to suspend your disbelief, but this is FNAF we are talking about it's kinda par for the course with this franchise lol.Not super scary, but I never really thought it would be; nor did I want it to be. If you are looking for something super gorey all the time or something that's constantly filled with jump scares you are gonna be a bit disappointed but I think the story more than makes up for it.And some of the deaths are just absolutely brutal like I literally gasped and shock and almost covered my nephews eyes for one of the deaths (I'm sure you all know which one I'm talking about).The movie is filled to the brim with Easter eggs and cameos and everything a FNAF fan could possibly want. Whether it's iconic phrases or referencing past games and even iconic music from the franchise this movie has it all.I think someone who has even the most rudimentary grasp of the FNAF lore and knowledge of the fanbase could tell that this movie was made with love and care and is truly dedicated to the fans that helped shape this franchise into what it is today.I can also appreciate how tongue and cheek the movie is sometimes but I know that it could be a turn off for some people. The movie can take it self seriously and raise the stakes while still pointing out some of the ridiculousness that we have all just come to accept with the franchise over the years.Overall the main reason it's not a 10 is because I think the sequel (which I hope they are going to end up making) can be even better.Bye y'all and remember to have a faz-tastic day!!",2023-10-28
"The FNAF movie provided a rollercoaster of emotions. On one hand, it's clear that the creators aimed for a wider audience by toning down the scares, which might be a plus for some viewers. However, the plot left much to be desired. It felt rushed and somewhat underdeveloped compared to the intricate storytelling found in the games. They even made significant changes to the plot, which may leave die-hard fans feeling a touch of disappointment.As a devoted fan of the FNAF series, witnessing this alteration in the narrative was a letdown. The film missed an opportunity to truly dive into the captivating FNAF universe. It's a tough watch for fans who were hoping for a more faithful adaptation.On the positive side, the costumes were a standout feature. They looked fantastic, capturing the essence of the characters remarkably well. It's evident that a lot of effort went into their design, bringing a tangible authenticity to the on-screen experience. However, it's worth noting that Springtrap's costume was a bit of a letdown. It seemed to lack the same level of detail and polish, resembling more of a homemade Halloween costume rather than the professional craftsmanship seen in the rest of the cast.Despite this hiccup, the visual appeal of the majority of the costumes was a definite highlight, adding an extra layer of immersion to the film. While the FNAF movie might not fully satisfy die-hard fans due to the altered plot, it's worth a watch for the impressive visual elements alone.",2023-10-27
"To start, I LOVE FNAF and I grew up with it so I will try to review it as a super fan. This movie's Easter eggs range from obscure to pretty common knowledge with the series and I'm pretty sure I didn't miss one and it was super fun! The fan service was almost exactly what I had dreamt it would be with the absence of a thing or two that I won't disclose. Watching it with friends who also love the series was a blast as we gawked at the fan service and found it funny and at times interesting. HOWEVER, fan service isn't a reasonable substitute for aspects of a good film. I had doubts because of the directors track record but this film really has issues that even I can see, and trust me I really wanted this one to be good. Starting with positives the movie at least kept me interested and I think it was shot decently well. The pacing was also mostly fine until the third act where it got a little shaky and most of the sets and the animatronics looked great but that's about all I can think of. The plot is okay but side plots that set up motives are short and a little strange. Speaking of motives, characters in games vs the movie seem different in weird ways, especially mike. I won't spoil it but if you know the lore the differences are strange and left me conflicted, especially at the end but more in that later. Even if you don't know lore the movie is predictable besides some aspects of the end. The ending feels really fast and is resolved strangely in my opinion and I don't know how cannon this thing is but some decisions made me as a lore loving fan confused a little angry. A few decisions made me as a fan mad as things they added that I think they should've avoided or things that are absent but this will vary with everyone. One thing I wished happened tho is that we got more time with the characters. I wish we got to see our heroes go through it a little more or something so that we really did root for them and care for them but they only sort of do it with mike and even then we could've fleshed it out more. The villain, though predictable, was barely in the movie and if felt like it relied on prior knowledge to make him feel threatening. Overall I had a blast but I really can't see a lot of people who didn't grow up with the series enjoying it because the for the fans spirt of the movie will just fly over there heads. I don't think this movie was completely trash and it did have a soul that was felt and conveyed by the director and the producer Scott but it definitely didn't feel like a good movie either. And maybe I'm saying it wasn't complete garbage because I am a fan but I do feel that there are a lot of movies out there that are definitely way more soulless, not fun, badly shot, (like the slender man movie) and more that this movie doesn't really compare to even if it's not a great film. Even though I'm slightly disappointed the time I had at this movie was unforgettable to me and the fact that this movie has finally made it after 9 years brings a smile to my face and should be celebrated, but I don't think that many will have the same experiences. I really wanted to like this and even though I didn't it was still fun especially as a fan even though things did rub me the wrong way now and then. If you like the series don't avoid this just go and have a good time and expect a great film. I will always love this franchise and I want people to see this movie and have fun despite the flaws but it's not for everyone sadly, but I hope it's one of those bad movies that gets a sequel because I'll be there no matter what.",2023-10-27
"Now, I've been a FNAF fan for about 5 years, and been waiting for this movie for 5 years. This was a movie that was serving something that was for long time FNAF fans, and will introduce people into the franchise.I can see why critics won't like it. There's a bunch of lore that needed to be answered. I felt like the movie handled enough lore to somewhat understand it, (if you haven't learned the lore) and once the second movie releases, they will look back on the first one and enjoy it more, hoping that the second movie explains a little more.From my perspective of a long time fan, this spoiled us. The fan service is thrown at there, especially near the 3rd act. This gave us more than what I could have expected from the movie.The cast is mainly some underground folks, but you may recognize them. Let me say that some of the acting was poor. Josh Hutcherson and his little sister Abby probably brought the best performances of the film. It was weak at times, but I could deal with it.This is definitely more of a thriller than a horror. The story comes first, but horror is also visible, but not really put on the spotlight till the end (extra points if you've seen the movie and get that reference)Overall, if you're a fan of the FNAF franchise, go see this. (or watch it on peacock) It will build your FNAF love even more, and if you're not a fan, you can still enjoy this movie for its story and kills. It is fun from the perspective of a critic, but from a fan, Five Nights at Freddy's is a hit.",2023-10-28
"I think the best word to describe this film is disappointment. Not that I was expecting much after the PG 13 rating but the movie was just boring. The element of fear that was a staple of the games and contributed to their success was simply absent. The script has a lot of holes, characters appear without meaning and do things that are then subverted without needing to be subverted. The villain is indifferent and the viewer can't negatively bond with him to become disgusted with him and receive the necessary catharsis at the end if he is defeated. That's how bad the script is.The only positive thing is that the visual effects are very good, but we all know that the most important thing in a movie/series is the script and that's where this movie loses. Unfortunately the production made the wrong decision that we all feared and made this film family friendly. If you have kids they might enjoy it but it is purely a movie aimed at kids (with all that implies).",2023-10-27
"The creativity of this film exceeded my expectations in terms of events, lighting, crazy scenes, wonderful production, and actors who excelled in their performances. If you know the story of the game, you will be the reason for happiness, and if you do not know the story of the game, you will understand through this movie, and they portrayed the main characters in a way Splendid and in a wonderful way, but not to mention some new information in the movie that we did not know before through the game. They made the movie in a new way that does not resemble the game so that you do not know the event and it becomes a bit boring.",2023-10-28
"I have been a fan of the games since 2015, and was one of the more active members in the online communities. At first, I was very nervous about this movie - and other people's comments about how it wasn't 'bloody enough' or 'changes the story too much' made me worry even more. But, having now watched it, I have to say that it's genuinely an awesome spin. The lore makes a lot of sense, while still keeping the characters somewhat the same.William Afton is now no longer Michael's father, but is instead Vanessa's, and this makes a lot of sense for the later games. It also still fits into Sister Location, and how Michael (without calling William his father), says that he'll find William, as William, at the end of the credit sequence, asks that Michael does. They still have the enemy relationship and fit into each other's stories.This movie also brings great opportunity to invite both Henry Emily and Charlie Emily in as characters. Vanessa being William's daughter could be a whole plot in of itself, with how she was either Charlie's only friend - or one of her bullies, that ultimately got her killed.Either one would be awesome to see.The part about influence makes a lot of sense too, as we see in the more recent FNAF games - both with controlled shocks, and by direct influence (eg; William's replica in FNAF: Security breach).A lot of people are mad about this movie - but honestly? As a long-time fan, it's good. Awesome, even. Matthew Lillard's (Although short) performance of the different in personality between Steve & William, is AMAZING. Arguably, people who are mad are either new fans, or people who simply don't understand the games.",2023-10-31
"Honestly, I've been a fan of Five Nights At Freddy's since it came out in 2014 and for me the long wait for this film has paid off.The film is truly enjoyable, for various reasons ranging from graphic effects to easter eggs and the plot that flows really well.However, unfortunately, one of the flaws I found in this film is certainly the lack of the feeling of anxiety that video games transmitted very often, and above all the lack of jumpscare (substantially the part that makes this film really a horror is missing), and therefore, this drastically decreases its value and notoriety, especially in the eyes of someone who does not know the Five Nights at Freddy's saga.All in all, however, I found it very nice and in my opinion it deserves a full 8.",2023-10-28
"No pun intended - I never played any of the games. So I kind of was at a disadvantage to all the kids(?)/people in the theater with me. They knew certain characters and knew how they would (re)act and all that. Josh seemingly in need of a job after the Hunger Games are over for him - just kidding of course. Well sort of - especially because he is really good in the movie.And while the games apparently do not have a lot of story (if any?), this really goes for a backstory for our main character ... and some depth too of course. I assume that a few will be able to see most twists coming their way ... that does not take anything away from the movie. The ending also does not mean that there will not be more ... the bonus scene during the credits is just another example for that ... this is not filled with violence or gore - it is a PG13 movie - but I think the games were the same ... so keep that in mind. Also do not watch the horrible German dubbed version ... ok that is quite specific, but just the trailer was enough to make me sick .. not in a good sense.",2023-11-02
"Full disclosure: I had never heard of the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise before the movie got released. Since October was coming to an end, I wanted to see one more horror flick. I had wanted to see ""Suitable Flesh"", but the only showing was at midnight, making it impossible, so I saw ""Five Nights at Freddy's"".The movie was pretty much what I expected. Any movie released for Halloween is bound to have a silly element, and this one sure did. Definitely nothing that's going to receive any Oscar nods. If you can accept it as a ridiculous idea, then you'll have fun. I will give it props for using actual animatronics instead of CGI.",2023-10-30
"I have been enjoying the games for almost 10 years and I'm immensely surprised by how much I enjoyed the film. Just the feeling I had during the entire film was constant happiness with how they could mix elements of the games for just fan fare to how well they could also juggle the plot in a way that a casual audience could understand and digest and have fun with. All the minor details to make the experience closer to the games really got to me.Seeing Coryxkenshin, The references to Sparky the Dog, and MATPAT made me lose my mind. I am so happy I avoided spoilers for the movie because I feel overwhelmed with emotions after watching it.Thank you Blumhouse
Thank you Scott Cawthon.",2023-10-28
"The long-awaited film adaptation of the popular horror game, Five Nights at Freddy's (FNAF), has finally hit the screens and it's nothing short of a cinematic triumph1. Directed by Emma Tammi, the movie has been the subject of hype and fan theories for months1.The film follows a troubled security guard as he begins working at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza2. The casting is spot-on with Josh Hutcherson delivering a compelling performance as Mike, the security guard, and Matthew Lillard brilliantly portraying the mysterious Steve Raglan3.What sets this movie apart is its faithful adaptation of the original game. The film's animatronics and attention to small details from the games have been widely praised3. It successfully replicates the game's intense atmosphere and jump-scares, making it a treat for both long-time fans and newcomers3.While some critics have been less kind about its story and level of horror3, it's important to remember that FNAF is not just about scares. It's about the suspense, the anticipation, and the thrill of what lurks in the shadows. And on these fronts, the movie delivers in spades.In conclusion, the Five Nights at Freddy's Movie is an emotional rollercoaster that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's a testament to how video game adaptations should be done, offering a perfect blend of nostalgia for fans and fresh thrills for newcomers. A solid 10/10!",2023-10-28
"Struggling with his life, a down-on-his-luck guy takes a job as a night security guard at an abandoned pizza party which starts to turn his life around slightly, but when he finds the true reason for the job and why they're after his daughter tries to save her from the sentient animatronic robots loose in the building.There's quite a lot to like with this one. One of the better elements here is the overall setup in place that puts everything in motion with his employment at the location. The entire first half with the deadbeat loser background beaten into this setup, the desire to keep his sister out of the diabolical aunt and her plans to bring the girl to live with her instead of the brother which spurns his later desire to take the job to help her all comes along together nicely. As the story goes along, the growing need to stay at the facility with how it helps him try to come to terms with the dreams that are the sole reason for his troubled life to this point becomes quite fun and generates quite a lot of depth to the kind of story presented here. This one also manages to come off quite well with its technical qualities presented pretty much throughout the film. The setup of the facility is pretty fun and looks nice with the abandoned layout and design which is the same perfectly slick, glossy feel appropriate for this kind of mainstream film. There's also a lot to like with the animatronics at play which look distinctive and highly expressive for what they are, coming into play well with the few scenes of the homicidal robots going crazy including the attack on the trespassers or the friendly interactions with the sister that shows their varying nature. It's all fine enough to give the film a lot of likable factors to hold it up over its flaws. This one does have some pretty big issues that bring it down. The biggest issue to be had here is the films' incessantly overlong and unnecessary setup that provides no real enjoyment or even connection to the franchise lore. The decision to go as deep as it does on the backstory of the security guard including the incident with his brother and the inability to figure out what happened then, the struggles with raising his sister alone despite the constant intrusions of the aunt to take her away and his struggles with finding a job are just not that interesting to see play out. It's not the kind of material that's warranted in this kind of film where it's supposedly about sentient animatronic robots going berserk in a run-down pizzeria. That indeed leads into the other factor with this one where it's nearly devoid of the kind of material usually warranted in this type of setup. With the aforementioned backstory already in play, the need to keep playing out each of these scenarios in detail trying to figure out the connections to everything keeps this from really unleashing the kind of mayhem expected here. The inability to let the killer animatronics go crazy and stalk a bunch of intruders inside the location is a big thing here since that's the main reason to enjoy this one and not doing that does hurt this one quite a bit for those expecting something similar to the chosen franchise.Rated PG-13: Violence, Language, and children-in-jeopardy.",2023-11-01
"Now I don't know TOO much about the FNAF lore, but what I do know is that I was not once on the edge of my seat during that movie. It felt like there was too much comedic relief throughout, sorta how Marvel structures their movies. The whole kids and ghost story flashbacks were overall uninteresting. I get why they did it and how they did it but I think it was a shot and a miss.I enjoyed the story with Abi and how Mike is struggling with his own health but clearly still cares for her. What I don't get is why he kept going back to the place he knew was getting dangerous, let alone SLEEPING there, and then allowing Abi to be there when the place had just been ransacked the day before? He would get cut/cut himself in his dreams yet it was like he just ignored that and continued on as if nothing happened.The animatronics themselves were really cool looking, I didn't even mind the glowing red eyes. The sound effects etc were all there but nothing felt like the fear you would feel when actually playing the games. There were no real flicking through camera moments, shutting the doors and flicking on light switches type of suspension etc.The villain was also poorly executed imo since it was the most generic option and obvious outcome, who would have thought the weirdo in the beginning would be Springtrap lol.Anyway. I still gave this movie a six since it did bring back some aspect of nostalgia and I did enjoy parts and laughed at some other parts. I respect the idea behind why they went with this route and still have high hopes the two planned sequels will learn from its origin and do better. Worth a watch but would not watch again.",2023-10-26
"Just got home from this movie, and it was pretty good! I'm going to try to keep this review spoiler-free.Similar to the games, the film relies on jump scares and the tension of wondering if the animatronics are moving, & if so where are they, for the scare factor. There isn't really any gore. If, like me, you go into this not knowing much about the ""lore"", you'll probably appreciate the way the story unfolds a little more & be surprised. My teens enjoyed the movie & said that there were some differences between the game backstory vs the movie storyline, but the main elements were the same. Matthew Lillard was fun to watch, as always! The movie ended in a way that there could certainly be a a sequel, but there wouldn't absolutely have to be. Overall, it was a fun movie!",2023-10-27
I was going into this movie expecting garbage but it was actually really good. I had a fun plot and some really cool kills. The best part of the movie is when Afton gets springtraped and he yells at the animatronics. I think the acting was very good especially for the child actors. I think it did very good fan service. It did actually have some pretty good jumpscares. The set/costume design looks amazing. If I'm gonna be honest I didn't really like the plot about Garrett to much but it is crucial for the movie. I think Matthew Lillard did an amazing job as William Afton. Overall I think the movie is a 7.4/10.,2023-10-30
"I've never played Five Nights at Freddy's, but I've seen others play it. To be honest, I don't really understand why the game is so popular. However, I am intrigued by the lore, so I went with my kids to see this adaptation. It's amusing. I thought it was going to have more jump scares (like the game). Not a lot of time is spent in the control room, either, but I enjoyed how they adapted the story. The film starts off pretty strong, even if the second half of the plot gets a little ridiculous. Still, the animatronics look great and I had fun. Maybe it's time I finally played Five Nights at Freddy's.",2023-10-29
"Mike Schmidt (Josh Hutcherson) is a young man with financial problems who takes care of his 10-year-old sister Abby (Piper Rubio), and who is tormented by the unsolved disappearance of his younger brother Garret more than a decade earlier. Recently fired and desperate to keep custody of Abby, Mike agrees to take a position as a night security guard at an abandoned themed restaurant: Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, but Mike soon discovers that nothing at Freddy's is what it seems, with the help of Vanessa ( Elizabeth Lail) a local police officer, Mike's nights at Freddy's will lead him to unexplained encounters with the supernatural and drag him into the heart of an unspeakable nightmare. In February 2018, it was announced that Chris Columbus would direct and write the film, as well as produce it with Blum and Cawthon. In August 2018, Cawthon announced on the Steam forums that the first draft of the film's script, which includes only the events of the first game, has been finished and that there may also be a second and third film. Blum also made a post on Twitter saying that the film does not have a date yet, but was expected for 2020, but Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was not possible.On November 20, 2020, Cawthon posted on Reddit that Mike's script had been optioned and that filming on the film was scheduled to begin in spring 2021.",2023-10-28
"I mean where can I start, this movie was incredible. As a fnaf lover since the games came out I could not be more excited for this movie and it was PERFECT. Everyone needs to go see it even if you do not know anything about the games it was still a chilling, creepy movie. This movie definitely was not a scary move per se but it was bone chilling and creepy. In my group to the theater one of my friends had no prior fnaf knowledge and thinks that fnaf is a nerdy video game. BUT she really enjoyed the movie and said it was entertaining and kept her engaged the whole time. She got invested in the character and was so excited throughout the movie. So fnaf tan or not, GO SEE THE MOVIE.",2023-10-28
"For all the numerous video game properties tailored made for a big screen adaptation, Scott Cawthon's low-budget 2014 point and click horror that managed to become a worldwide sensation doesn't scream feature film but thanks to the ever-savvy minds behind the Blumhouse horror brand, close to a decade on from first appearing in the wild, Five Nights at Freddy's has arrived.Shrugging off mostly negative critical reviews to make an astounding $130 million global box office haul in its opening weekend against a reported $20 million budget, the pizza and fizzy drink is likely flowing at the Blumhouse head office right now with director Emma Tammi's iteration of Cawthon's tale (one he produced and co-wrote) becoming an instant smash hit but while fans of the game series are going to have a field day with the films many Easter eggs and throwbacks/callbacks, Tammi's film is a messy adaptation of a relatively simple premise and one that quickly loses steam after a decent opening act.There was always going to be issues for whoever decided to take on the Freddy's property with the games simple ideas and presentation not exactly the type of deep material ripe for the narrative expansion treatment and that's where Tammi and her creative team find the most trouble, as their film becomes something it never really needed to be as Josh Hutcherson's boorish main protagonist Mike the security guard making for a bland and charisma free central premise as he enters into the world of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.A man traumatised by his troubled past and battling the present as he attempts to fend for his younger sister Abby, Tammi tries to give us a reason to care for Mike on more than a surface level but when we keep getting drawn further into Mike's world and taken out of the films best asset, the pizzeria itself, we are constantly thrown into terribly designed and narratively misguided angles, making Freddy's one of the most nonsensical and hard to take features of the year.You don't watch these type of films and particularly not one with the Five Night's brand attached too it for a rich narrative experience but that doesn't excuse Tammi from taking us on such a constantly head scratching journey and while early on there's menace and intrigue around the pizzeria and the history of its far from cuddly animatronic inhabitants, when furniture forts, evil dream children and incompetent police officers take centre stage the film really goes off the rails and becomes a genuine misfire deserving of all the critical drubbings.With news already surfacing that more Freddy is on its way thanks to the free flowing box office receipts of recent days, we can only hope that the glimmers of something decent seen in this first iteration can find their way to the forefront in the next big screen adventure.Final Say -With an uninteresting human lead, an increasingly outlandish plot and an unbalanced approach to its group of bloodthirsty robots, Five Night's at Freddy's may find ways to appease the most positive of fans but judged on its own merits, this is a misfire in need of some serious rewiring.1 1/2 missing babysitters out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",2023-11-01
"Not like a game yet it is like a game. In the game there works imagination so as here. But in the game had been more audio and sudden screamers and it was scary cra..crop out of me. As a Slender games, ya'now.And as a story, playing, you could' imagine pretty psychological thriller of a security guard's surviving - and do movie like this it is not impossible, there a lot scariest movies 'surviving in one room or something like that'.Or more deeper plot about how, who and why with much more higher rating 'cause of that.I should'n had any hope since, well, Slender's movie, but it is still sad.",2023-10-31
"Waiting in line for the Five Nights at Freddy's movie and I am sitting behind two young guys who have a laptop open and are looking up the FNAF ""lore"" to give context to what they are about to see. ""Reddit will know."" one of them says to the other. But having been in this fandom since August 2014, I know that reddit will not know. In fact, there is no agreed on consensus on almost any aspect of this series. That is the landscape this movie emerges into and it is critical to understand to truly appreciate what we are looking at.Most critics will approach the movie the way they approach any Halloween horror movie release, looking at it from the perspective of accessibility to audiences, storytelling and the quality of its scares, that is certainly a tried and true formula for pumping out horror reviews, but I would argue that in this instance, this approach is flawed and will never quite touch the depths of the author and producer's intentions. Treating the FNAF movie as an isolated piece of media is treating part of a series as an isolated work divorced from its surroundings.Watching the movie I could see how Scott and the others who worked on it endeavoured to disguise the shape of the narrative as something simple, something with clear and familiar beats that movie goers could understand. Troubled man picks up job, has responsibilities to his sibling, historic murders and spooky robots. However, as someone deeply entrenched in the fandom and theories, I want to try and explain to you what it felt like for one of the fans to enjoy this work.ContinuitiesFans approach this movie with some baseline understandings of what they are about to see, of the characters who are at play. We are used to Scott subverting expectations and pulling the rug out from beneath us. We are also used to Scott using alternate continuities to shed light upon the series he created.Scott himself has discussed this branching out into other continuities in the past as below.""The truth is that after a while lore can become so dense that there isn't room for a story anymore. Another truth is that what makes for a good game doesn't necessarily make for a good book. Sometimes a timeline gets so full that the only way to tell a real story is have the story set in a different timeline, an alternate universe, a different location, or perhaps from a vantage point that isn't entirely what it appears to be.""The movie is another version of this ethos, where characters are another version of the story. However, Scott is notorious for this vantage point twisting, what appears to be the truth often is not at all the case. For instance, in The Silver Eyes, the first book novel trilogy, the series began with Charlie, who appeared to be a normal girl and relative of the Fazbear's founders going back to Freddy Fazbear's and Hurricane Utah. However, within two books we found out that she was actually a robot and finds herself up against another robot who is a clone of her (her adult self) who is powered by the spirit of William Afton's deceased daughter.As you can see, things can go unexpected places, and I feel like this movie is certainly no different. Let me give a little context. Fans are going into this movie not sure if Mike Schmidt is William Afton's son, regardless of whether it is or is not confirmed in the movie, does this mean that there isn't some INCREDIBLY convoluted and crazy plot underpinning the solution? No. Other franchises give straightforward answers to straightforward questions, in this franchise it is always more complex, there could be far deeper factors at play, it could be anything at all. The story of FNAF is a puzzle, and acknowledging this as an inherent part of the series is absolutely baseline to really giving it a fair shot in criticism.From a more conventional look at the movie, the cinematography is lovely, with beautiful shots and thoughtful framing, and the story is told clearly and in a way that makes optimal use of the time they are able to utilize. It could have been five hours long and I would have been interested the entire time. Unfortunately, when seeking to establish a new viewer base this kind of long attention cannot be relied upon. The director shows an almost tender attention to the human characters and this is important as they are critical to the series as much as its iconic animatronics. Anyone complaining the animatronics did not receive sufficient screen time has not understood the fundamental story underpinning the series (a forgivable sin given that at this point it sprawls 13 games and at least 28 books.) The FNAF series is about more than just the animatronics, it is about the history that created them, the legacy of the video game industry and the rise and fall of a business enterprise, replete with its inherent criticisms of capitalism and retail work culture. It is also quite centrally about families and the theme of family, something which is very close to Scott Cawthon's heart. Some of the more obscure of these themes are not overt within the movie itself and therefore could easily and understandably be missed by a newcomer to the series, however I felt that family was still at the heart of what we saw. Overall however, I feel that the movie is rendered more shallow by not understanding the richness of the source material.The actors do a fantastic job of portraying their respective characters, from the troubled and temper prone Mike (Josh Hutcherson) to the mysterious Steve Raglan (Matthew Lillard) to the supporting cast doing a great deal to cast light on the shape of the setting and threats therein. Lillard in particular has a challenging task of conveying a multi layered character and accomplishes this extremely well. As a long time fan, I will be thinking about this performance for the months to come and find myself grateful for the attention paid to a truly complex character. Screen time was limited for some characters, but I do not think this diminished their impact at all, merely heightened the threat they represented. There were certainly audible responses in my theatre when the important twists were revealed.The fandom also comes into this movie expecting cameos from their favourite creators who helped to popularize and grow the series over the years, and Scott Cawthon has not forgotten those who helped him, inviting the major figures who devoted their time to the movie to take part in it. There are plenty of surprises and delights for fans waiting for this to happen, and it simply adds to the feeling of the movie as a celebration of the game series. However, unlike many other series out there, the treatment of these cameos is treated with nuance and subtlety and they could be overlooked by the casual viewer. There is an intimacy to this movie and how it handles fan references, with almost none of the toe curling nostalgia bait moments that are so familiar to modern viewers. There are no random confusing elements thrown in without context or narrative purpose simply to serve as cheap relatability. The movie feels loved, and the nods to the fandom in turn feel loving rather than a corporate lever pull.The animatronics are imbued with incredible life and character by the Jim Henson creature workshop, and other characters who show up later are given this same incredible attention to detail. The animatronics were quite simply breathtaking to me as a fan of the series. The FNAF fandom is known for its extensive fan animation community, with incredibly professional level animators creating content for the fans to enjoy, but even with this history, I felt like this movie breathed life into the animatronics on a level I have never seen before. They felt solid and real (thanks in no small part to the practical effects employed for their creation) but also warm and approachable. The viewers find themselves completely able to understand why these strange machines captured the attention of children historically, and to me this is critical. Too many people misunderstand the animatronics and when creating their own versions make them just openly strange or ugly, with shallow appeal, just spooky handpuppets and a monster of the week. Five Nights at Freddys is not afraid to humanise the animatronics and warm the audience to them, even if it appears to diminis their value a little as flat jumpscare fodder. They are ultimately victims, and the movie is not afraid of this either.The soundtrack is fun and the sound design is competent, giving memorable and familiar songs to help reinforce the era of the movie without turning it into a jukebox musical. There is restraint shown in the context of the songs and the choices made were thoughtful and relevant for a track list. The post credits even have something special for those looking for some further puzzles to unpick in the series.Overall, I could not recommend the movie more highly to fans. As long as they approach it with the understanding that we are looking not at some grand reveal of all the mysteries of the decade long game series but a new alternate look at potentials and the characters we know and love, they will draw endless value from it. At my showing there were many other people in costume (alongside myself) and the response from the fans that were there was warm and excited. Scott Cawthon said the following.""Going into this next week, I want you all to know that I have literally one thing on my mind, and that's hoping that the fanbase enjoys this movie. This movie was made for all of you.""The FNAF movie was made for us, the fans.Which is not to say that new fans are not welcome, if anything I'm incredibly excited to see what new curious and excited puzzle seekers join our ranks as a result of this movie's release. I am delighted that the movie seems accessible to new people as a first step in the franchise. There will be more, no doubt in my mind.And I'm going to be here for wherever it takes us.",2023-10-26
"I've loved FNAF since the game's release 10 or something years ago. Always knew that a movie would be made someday and it was great to see the fans' beloved animatronics come to life on the big screen. Solid 6/10.There were a lot of issues though, it was far from perfect and the main problem, for me, was the writing and pacing of the story. It felt a little sloppy in parts.I liked Mike's character and how the trauma of losing his brother had affected his life. The desperation of needing any kind of job to support his little sister, really came across. Great to see Josh Hutcherson in a movie again!The addition of Vanessa and Afton into the story was great also, my face lit up when I saw Afton walk onscreen as Springtrap. Hope to see more of Matthew Lillard, perfect casting!Honestly, what I didn't like was the lack of horror and claustrophobia that you feel in the games. It felt like the writers were playing it safe. If they do a sequel, I really hope they amp up the horror elements!",2023-10-29
"I did not know there was a video game called Five Nights at Freddy's and that this narrative is based on that same series. I have only come to be aware of that a few days ago, and hence, I cannot comment on how much of a faithful adaptation it was or what kind or how many changes they went through.I can only assess this from a cinematic standpoint, and in that respect, this was a fairly decent watch. It's nothing extraordinary in any way, but the neat storytelling and the ambience will keep you invested till the end credits begin to roll. It could have done much better had they taken advantage of all the tricks and tropes they had at their disposal.I wanted more bodies to drop and more blood to splatter, but that didn't happen; thus, I was a bit disappointed.",2023-10-29
If this is for the fans I was a bit disappointed. I mean there's lots of plot holes if you're considering the lore which fans should be if it's for them. Like why would they not remember who did it that's never been the plot and the cupcake being completely sentient on its own was confusing. Also why is Vanessa the cop just letting her dad roam with a new name to continue killing children. Also how was it specifically William who stole his Mike's brother but he wasn't from their town or else he would've been to Freddy's or at least heard of it. Also the dialogue is very cringe and the reveal was done not great. But the animatronics really did look awesome and you can tell a lot of love was put into the effects team of this movie and for that alone I think it's worth seeing even though the story is a little too campy and lackluster.,2023-10-27
"Fnaf was so scary, and I really enjoyed it, even though I know barely anything about the games. I do not understand how it was r 13, it should've been r 16. It had a couple of really graphic scenes, but the rest was fine, it was still scary though. The two really graphic scenes were a girl getting bitten in half by Freddy, and then when Mike saw all the bloody corpses. Every scene at the diner had so much tension, and I was nervous for every scene, but all the other ones were fine. Most people say the jump scares were lame, but they all made me scream a little bit. Especially that puppet in the cupboard. Definitely watch this movie but definitely do not show it to anyone under 13, unless if they're really familiar with the games, and they're used to a bit of violence.",2023-10-31
"So, having never played but heard of the Game series in which this film is an adaption of, I went into this one blind, with only an idea from the previews as to what to expect. I remember this project being in development since 2015 if I recall, so it's not a surprise to me that this was coming, but the lack luster gore, is what I found surprising for a film which lead on to be as such.The film follows Mike Schmidt, a security guard for a shopping center who loses his job after assaulting a negligent father who he mistakes for a child snatcher. In order to avoid losing custody of his sister, Abby, it is then he gets a job as a night guard at an abandoned Family Diner, Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. But after the first night, he begins to experience weird goings on & later from a Police Officer named Vanessa, the dark truth about the now abandoned Family Diner.I found the film to be not bad. But room for improvement for sure. For one, the lack of gore & graphic deaths is one of the biggest down sides with this film. Not to mention the lack of scares & or action.The film also drags quite a bit & has a lengthy runtime of 1 hour 44 minutes. So, it's also a down side there too, but despite that, the animatronics are sinister looking, the story isn't bad & the characters are pretty good too. Josh Hutcherson of The Hunger Games & Matthew Lillard of Scream are good additions to this film. The other cast members are good too.The jumping around the plot was a bit annoying, but made sense by the end & did keep you guessing, though you sort of knew what & who was the killer & where it was heading in the end. The colours & effects were pretty good & the sinister feeling was well done with the child like nature of the animatronics & Diner.Overall, it's not bad. But there's a load more improvement to be done here. The film drags & is 104 minutes too long & lacks gore & graphic deaths which makes for neutered frustrating viewing along with the plot jumping around to much & feeling somewhat muddle in terms of story telling. I wanted more of a body count & the trailers were pretty misleading with this one. For a film that's rated 15, you expect a great deal of gore at least, yet here, it was watered down to the max. If another director had took the project, a man, this would've been better & less drawn out & boring in a lot of scenes. The bright lights, graphics & animatronics were good & the sinister feeling with the child like setting was good, so there's that, but don't expect too much from this film, it's not as gory as the trailers make out.6/10.",2023-10-27
"2023's Five Nights at Freddy's represents a new breed in horror. It's almost like a horror drama if you will. Sure people get killed and blood is shed but there's a complexity to ""Freddy's"", a sort of non-archetypal way in which it goes about its business. There's child abduction and family custody stuff and oh yeah, mechanical, puppet-like bots who like to get their Saw on. Emma Tammi directs by adapting ""Freddy's"" from a video game (of the same name). She also digs up the body of The Romantics ""Talking in Your Sleep"" for added effect. ""And I know that I'm right 'cause I hear it in the night"". Uh-huh.Shot in Louisiana and ready-made for the spooky season (that would be Halloween), Five Nights at Freddy's takes its time with the audience, reveling in setups and slow burn spectacle as opposed to just laying down the gore (hence the PG-13 rating). I mean if you've seen the trailer you'd think that you would be getting a straight-up slasher pic or snuff contrivance. Wrong. ""Freddy's"" is like a grubby version of a dramatic sitcom with a little food chain carnage thrown in. Yup, I see a box-office drop from ""Freddy's"" awesome opening take (78 mil). And I also see some bloodthirsty fright fans turned off from future viewings. Oh well. There's enough eerie, humor exaggeration and glow dim, 80s palate to at least garner a slight recommendation. ""Where fantasy and fun come to life"". Indeed.Starring Josh Hutcherson, Elizabeth Lail, and Matthew Lillard (who again gets his Scream fix via a twist ending), Five Nights at Freddy's is about a rattled thirtysomething who takes on a security job at an abandoned pizza joint similar to the famed Chuck E. Cheese. There, he encounters things that go bump in his night shift and a whole lot more. The performances are decent, the animatronics are kind of creepy, and the scare factor is sadly only abundant if you've lived a sheltered, cinematic existence. I'll bite. I mean I've seen schlock like Hell Fest and this is much better. Taking ""five"".",2023-10-30
"Based on the game with the same name that came out in 2014 by Scott Cawthon, I have played some of the Five Nights at Freddy's games and liked playing them, along with knowing a lot about the lore that goes on in the games; after many years we finally get the movie by Blumhouse. The new Blumhouse movie Five Nights at Freddy's (2023) was an entertaining and fun movie, though not that scary, it has great tie ins to the games, and you can tell that the filmmakers, actors, and the director cared for the source material along with having the creator Scott Cawthon be one of the writers.Josh Hutcherson did an excellent job as the security guard Mike Schmidt; he is dealing with the loss of his brother but also trying to figure out what happened to him, along with trying to keep custody of his younger sister Abby played by Piper Rubio, who was also not bad in the movie. Abby communicates with the animatronics in some way, and Mike is having dreams that connect to the disappearances of five children from the 80's that might help him figure out what happened to his brother; this I thought was interesting and a cool way to connect things but also help the character. Matthew Lillard does a wonderful job as the main antagonist as Steve Raglan/William Afton, who is the main antagonist in the games and responsible for making the animatronics; though he should have been in the movie more, he gives an entertaining performance, and was crazy parts very well.I love the fact that Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, and Cupcake animatronic are real animatronics instead of being CGI like most movies would have done and they are accurate looking to the game; having them move around, seeing their eyes light up, having them attack people, and that they make certain sounds that are from the game was amazing to see, along with their endoskeletons looking like how they are in the game. Though this movie is PG-13, it gets away with brutal kills and blood effects when the animatronics are attacking people; the movie has a lot of references, tie ins, and easter eggs in the movie that fans of the games will notice, along with their being cameos from certain kinds of youtubers.The movie is not perfect or anything because it has some things about it that can stick out; there are certain things that occur in the movie that do not come back again, or they are not fully resolved, and some lines of dialogue the characters are given that was a little weird along with some characters that are a bit random. The movie does take a while to get to the animatronics at times, leading it to focus more on Mike, his dreams, his issues, and him dealing with this new job he has; when the animatronics come out and are killing people or are just on screen, the movie is very entertaining to watch, but sometimes the moments with the younger sister Abby bonding with them could get a little weird and unnecessary.I had an entertaining and fun time with this movie, though it has some issues, and it is not perfect, it was great to finally get this movie and see that the people who worked on it did care for it and the games it based on; fans of the games will like the movie Five Nights at Freddy's (2023), for the people who have not played any of the games, the movie is entertaining by itself but you might not understand certain things. The movie Five Nights at Freddy's (2023) was a fun time and not bad of a video game adaptation; check this movie out if you are a fan of the games or if you are a newcomer.",2023-10-27
"A really cool movie. The bad thing about the movie is that the action starts late, but I was really good. We could finally find out what happened in the games and now I hope the second movie is going out sooner or later. But the good thing about the movie got to be the lore and that we could learn about the lore. We could finally see the spring lock scene. The story of the characters was good and the plot twist was great I honestly didn't expected Vanessa to be Afton's doughter. The ending was a bit odd but it work. I watched the movie twice so I can honestly say it was good and I totally recommend the movie.",2023-10-28
"I really enjoyed about a half hour or so of this engrossing film. I have never played the game nor ever will. But the movie was really interesting up to a point, when the farcical elements became too apparent.I mean utterly ridiculous. This borders on the realm of fantasy horror. Stick to real life. There are more unusual stories based on actual events than made up fantasies. However I'm being a little lenient here because the film is based on a PC game and with all the tongue in cheek dark humor therein.Plot: it is a dark tale indeed. A man lost his brother when he was a young boy, kidnapped in broad daylight at a park. He witnessed the kidnapping but is unable to communicate this to his parents and save his brother. He is tormented by this guilt up to his adult life. Things take a mysterious turn when he gets a job as a night guard at an abandoned family diner known as Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. There he falls asleep and starts dreaming again of the same day his brother was kidnapped. Watch the film to find out what happens next...Verdict: much better than most of the dull horror films I have seen this year like Pet Sematary Bloodlines and Exorcist Believer. This is a very good movie but as the old adage goes, ""too many cooks spoil the broth"". If kept to reality, rather than supernatural horror, this would have been a very good movie.A movie based on a real-life incident: Adam(1983).",2023-10-28
I don't have much hope or expectations from a 2023 movie and this one wasn't in my top 10 but it wasn't all that bad.It had some story and a mysterious aspect to it that kept me watching even though it was still somewhat predictable. I've never played the games myself and thought this would be like one of those cases where the guard is badass and fights against the monsters and destroys them. So I was glad it had more of a plot besides that.There were some moments that did feel a bit boring and slow paced and the ending was a bit underwhelming and expected but it made sense to a degree.Otherwise it was well made.,2023-10-30
"""Five Nights at Freddy's"" is a movie based on the famous video game saga of the same title. I have known its popularity since its inception but I have never played one of them but I have enjoyed this movie which is not really horror, but it is a light horror story that managed to thrill its fans and even me. The cast gives good performances, highlighting Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lillard, as well as the young promise Piper Rubio. The cinematography is well done and the atmosphere is gloomy, the special effects and animatronics are excellently developed and the script tells a simple but interesting story from beginning to end. ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" is a fun and soft horror film that is reminiscent of ""M3gan"", a film released at the end of 2022 and which was a success at the beginning of 2023, now at the end of the year this new film arrives with the same charm.",2023-10-26
"Though it was kinda cheesy, I think the best way to describe this movie is it was fun. The thing is, there isn't much terrifying scene in this movie and I'm not saying the movie DOESN'T make jump but, I feel like the scares is kinda average to me. And as a FNaF fan for the longest time it was surreal this movie finally came out and I'm STILL very grateful. And I need to say that people need to realizethat the movie and the game took place in DIFFERENT universe like, they just need to accept WHAT SCOTT wanna do with it, it HIS decision and not y'alls. For the jumpscares, they're SO unexpected but reused so much.",2023-10-28
"Five Nights at Freddy's is a video game series that I have yet to play. I've always wanted to and I've heard great things, I just never got around to them. Based on the creepy images and a bit of gameplay I've seen, I was all in on them giving a live-action film a try. Well, it's now playing in theatres and available at home and after watching it, while I did enjoy it, it's a film that feels confused with itself. I don't think it's quite the movie even fans of the games are expecting it to be. Here are my thoughts on Five Nights at Freddy's.Mike (Josh Hutcherson), an older brother who is currently fighting for the custody of his younger sister, takes the midnight shift as a security guard at an old children's arcade called Freddy Fazbear's. After making friends with a police officer, Vanessa (Elizabeth Lail), she tells him about the creepy goings-on of this place. The animatronic robots that used to sing and dance on stage for children are now possessed. The reason they're possessed is pretty twisted, so I'll leave that for you to see for yourself. Here's the thing though, I'm not sure how creepy this film really is.The light-hearted nature of each character elevated the film enough times where comedy was working, but it's also a very sad story when you get the backstory of Mike and his sister. On top of that, there are jump scares, but also 80s music played for fun sequences. I wasn't sure if this film wanted to be a drama, a horror film, or just a fun, silly experience. There were multiple times when I could tell they were going for something scary, but the visuals just had me having fun with it, which I'm not sure if they intended or not. There are a few jumbled tones that didn't work for me. Still, I did have a good time watching it.It was nice to see Josh Hutcherson in a leading role again, Elizabeth Lail had some good chemistry with him as well, but the movie itself, for as interesting as the backstory is, feels messy. This should've been a simple, creepy horror film about being stuck in this place overnight, but far too much time is spent away from this building and I just found myself torn as to whether or not it actually worked as a whole. Credit should be given to director Emma Tammi and the entire team who did the effects work here though. I don't think much CGI was used here at all. The set pieces were terrific and a joy to look at. In the end, Five Nights at Freddy's delivers some enjoyment, but nothing more to take it over the edge.",2023-10-28
"I enjoyed the movie personally, as i have played the FNAF games and read the books. I would say it's more based to the books, but that still doesn't mean it's not a good watch. For the people who aren't familiar to the lore, it's still a good watch because it adds in lore that's not canon.Regardless, i really enjoyed this movie and the effort that went into it, all though the ending felt a little rushed; i do believe it was mainly because of fans pushing to see the movie sooner. If nothing, i'm more than grateful to see one of my childhood games getting a movie, because they didn't need to do that. If anything this was a passion project that i'm more than happy to have watched.10/10, would watch again.",2023-10-28
"A movie of this nature you would think wouldn't work, the games didn't have a huge story behind them but this does. The story of Mike and his struggles is so well done, you root for his character so much that you want him to survive his nights but after seeing the animatronics, you might change your mind because you want to see these fantastic looking characters create some death! This film although does lack horror, makes up for it in suspense, enough to make you sit at the edge of your seat, watching intently to see what happens next. This movie was also made for the fans, so expect a lot of fan service, but you don't have to be a fan of the games to know what's going on. It will be just as great!",2023-10-26
"How does this movie count as a Horror movie? This movie had so many stupid scenes and cliches! The acting was fake. The movie's storyline was lame. I hated it. I highly recommend that no one sees this movie. If you want a horror movie about killer animatronics, please watch Willy's Wonderland. At least Nicholas Cage made that movie sooooo better. Just, please don't watch this movie. You won't be wasting your movie, buying a ticket and watching this trash heap of a movie.I honestly think that you'll be better watching Willy's Wonderland. It's a way better movie and you'll love it more. Thanks.",2023-11-01
"I just got back from the theatre from seeing this. My cousin wanted to see it and the trailer looked interesting so him, my uncle and I went to see it. I honestly really enjoyed it. There we're some creepy moments and there we're some funny moments. I'm not a gamer so I never played the games so I went into this movie having only seen the trailer pretty much. I was entertained all the way through. Character's we're great. Whether you're a gamer and are a fan of the games or not, it's an enjoyable movie. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys horror movies, especially if you're a fan of the games. I enjoyed it as lot more than I thought I would.",2023-10-29
"To follow the core story of ""Five Nights at Freddy's"", you do not need to have played the game. I have never picked up a copy of ""FNAF"" and went into the movie somewhat blind, only knowing bits and pieces of the lore. As events unfolded, there was never a moment when the main plot felt confusing. As a mildly creepy, jump-scare filled thriller, the film delivered.The main character, Mike, has a strong backstory with clear motives and reasoning. His character has a strong focus on a concept called ""Dream Theory"", which is fascinating. The performance by Josh Hutcherson is admirable and I truly cared about what happened to him and his sister.Apart from big blockbuster superhero films, I have never seen a crowd so excited and invested in a movie. On more than one occasion, the majority of the crowd went berserk with enthusiastic applause, and I had no clue the reason. While the story was simple to follow, the deeper pieces of ""FNAF"" lore left a portion of the audience on the outside of an inside joke.Rather than keep the film a tight 90 minutes, there is about 20 minutes of fluff that unnecessarily dragged on. The side-plot of the movie was dull and half-baked, with some of the characters falling into stereotypes. Similarly, though Mike's backstory is interesting, the end of his narrative lacks closure.As the end credits rolled, I leaned over to talk to some of the patrons who cheered the loudest during the ""inside joke"" moments. The two audience members had this to say: ""It was a cinematic masterpiece. We know everything about ""FNAF"", having played all the games, and it stayed true to about 75% of the source material.""If you are familiar with ""Five Nights at Freddy's"", this film will not disappoint. However, as someone with minimal exposure to the source material, the result was a bit lackluster.Best Character - Mike
Best Scene - The Dreams
Best Piece of Score - ""Five Nights at Freddy's""",2023-11-02
"I watched the movie right away when it released over here, I had already read some articles online saying how bad the movie is and so on - but now that i've seen the movie I can say , that the bad critics are not something you should put your trust in. I think everyone should go and form their own opinion on the movie. I think Blumhouse did a great job portraying the fnaf story , especially their way of exploring the lore behind everything was good! Scott worked so hard for this movie , it's script and basically everything. OG fans may be confused here and there by how the chracters are related to each other, but that's not a big deal. The casting was amazing , so as the storyline! The movie had a lot of easter eggs that fans were able to spot and be excited at! There could've been a bit more gore and that sorta stuff , but it was amazing nevertheless! The characters deaths were written and done in a good way!Also the springlock scene at the end was portrayed perfectly & couldn't have been more realistic!All in all , as someone that grew up with the fnaf franchise, I think they did good justice to the games and did a great job overall! Nothing big to criticize here , hoping the rating go up a lil' bit more. They deserve praise for their hard work and passion they put into all of this!Thanks Scott & Crew!",2023-10-28
"This movie was about a security guard who, as a child, lost his little brother to a kidnapping. Now he works at a weird abandoned fun house park for kids where the animatronics are possessed by the ghosts of dead kids. His journey to unravel the disappearance of his brother is linked to these animatronics, as they take liking to his little sister who they want to turn her into one of them, and in return they will tell the security guard who kidnapped his brother.The film really makes zero sense. The rules of the world are all over the map and incoherent and contradictory. But the creature designs and the overall aesthetic of the film is really pretty fun. Hardly a horror classic, or even a good movie, but it's kinda fun and weird and trippy in its own right. I didn't hate it but I never felt it rose to the occasion to become an iconic horror monster classic.",2023-10-31
With eyes on this video game series it's a solid 8. Now as a movie critic I would give it a 5.5. I'll go in the middle accept a 6.5 being rounded up to 7.All the references in the movie are great and you really appreciate the nods to the series. With that said it drags and drags to get anywhere. When it doesn't want to focus on the video game related content it's boring. If you don't know the games you'll be scratching your head being lost. I was entertained by it but I do know if I wasn't a fan I would of not been as invested. The cast in the film are alright. The animatronics themselves look amazing. Though with that said there are a few scenes in the film that are very silly and over the top. Not scary at all and feels like filler scenes. I do agree with a few other reviews it does feel like a comedy / light hearted when it's supposed to be Dark / Scary. Now when the film gets to the climax it does feel like a very good end and sets up for future films. Also extra bonus point was for a lot of the FNAF's community (YouTube / Twitch Streamers) being placed around the film won't spoil whose in but if you know where to look you'll love the nods. In the end if your Fan I highly recommend it if not then Try it but don't expect a lot from it.,2023-10-28
"I actually enjoyed this movie a lot and was pretty fun. If you know the franchise lore, you will probably know what is going to happen in the movie. The story is just like the games with a security guard accepting a night-time job at the place with killer animatronics. But the movie goes into deeper with different types of topics and plotlines throughout. The movie doesn't use animatronics that much and is underutilized in it. It focuses on the character driven plot with Mike trying to be a good brother to his sister and his struggles on his brother disappearance. While both of them have a purpose in this movie with he accepting the job in the hope of being a better guardian to his sister and finding out the truth behind his brother. But it feels like it takes most of the spot of the entire movie and is rather predictable with the outcome of it. The side plot with the aunt wanting to take his sister goes nowhere interesting.Now, the movie isn't scary at all because there's a lack of scares to be found in it. But the suspense decent durning the climax of the movie. It's also fun to watch the scenes with the animatronics and the Easter eggs you can find in this movie. And some expected stuff the animatronics do in this movie.",2023-10-28
"Ridiculous, i watched an hour and a half fnaf movie and i didnt get to hear markiplier scream out ""IS THAT THE BITE OF '87?!?!?"" mid ol movie 1/10. Hey guys, did you know that in terms of human companionship, Flareon is objectively the most huggable Pokemon? While their maximum temperature is likely too much for most, they are capable of controlling it, so they can set themselves to the perfect temperature for you. Along with that, they have a lot of fluff, making them undeniably incredibly soft to touch. But that's not all, they have a very respectable special defense stat of 110, which means that they are likely very calm and resistant to emotional damage. Because of this, if you have a bad day, you can vent to it while hugging it, and it won't mind. It can make itself even more endearing with moves like Charm and Baby Doll Eyes, ensuring that you never have a prolonged bout of depression ever again.",2023-10-28
"They finally make a good movie! The classic feel of older. Great horror films with real effects! Directing was also well done even with the over used spin shot! The story is great contrary to what all the negative reviews say! The cast was great as well. Was not sure how Josh would do in this roll but he pulled it off! Matthew put me in the mind of one of his 1990's characters as well! When you cast for the roll, it does make a huge difference than casting from a checklist!!Hope to see sequels come along that can live up to this film! Also hope the main cast came come back and they can pick this up where it leaves off! Than you Blumhouse for something good for once!",2023-10-30
"Before you watch, keep in mind this is more of a dark mystery film than it is an actual horror like the marketing suggests. It doesn't actually have that much of a focus on horror and mostly focuses on it's characters.I don't think this is a bad movie, but I think it could've been a lot better. The best thing is probably the animatronics, which look amazing, and were masterfully crafted. They look absolutely INCREDIBLE. Although I wish they could've gotten more actual action in the movie.There are a lot of references for FNAF fans (including me) to enjoy, but at the same time the film takes a lot of creative liberties. Ultimately, I left this movie with the feeling they could've done so much more with it, and the pacing felt off. And there were a few character moments that felt off as well. Although I did enjoy the relation between Mike and his younger sister, Abby.Although I did get a decent amount of enjoyment out of it, I just wish they could've done more with it. There were a few moments that felt cheesy, like the tape introducing Mike to the restaurant glitching, or the scene with one of the kids in Mike's dream turning into a ghost with empty bleeding eyes, which could've been creepy if it didn't look so fake. And most of all, the flying cupcake animatronic, which is just utterly ridiculous. The movie seems to expect you to take a _flying cupcake animatronic_ seriously.And this cupcake gets a lot of scenes. While the other animatronics get some action in the film, albeit not much, Freddy, you know, the mascot of the series this film is based on, barely gets any in comparison. THE FLYING CUPCAKE gets far more action in this movie than the actual titular character.Also Aunt Jane just gets left dead in Mike's house. Maybe Golden Freddy hid the body somewhere, but nothing alludes to this.There were some interesting concepts, like the dream theory, and the notion of drawings being significant because of how we perceive images through the world. Although they could've been implemented better.Also Matpat's cameo is one of the greatest moments in all cinema, so gotta give the film a point for that.Overall 6/10. It's kinda just an ok film.",2023-10-30
"As a FNAF fan myself, I can say that I seen the movie myself and I didn't want to spoil anything until someone sees it for themselves. Anyway the movie was something a FNAF fan will enjoy for themselves, me included. I gaves this film a big hit in my book. In some cases, it is a very good movie. And I hope this film comes out on DVD or other streaming services soon. I really wanted to watch this film again at anytime soon. If the animatronics look very good and compared to the game. Believe me I played Fnaf 1. I've been a FNAF fan since 2014. So I gave this movie 10 out of 10. With best lines, best character designs, and more. That's all I have to say. Until next time, this is Slhgfan Signing out.Slhgfan.",2023-10-28
"My review (kinda?) contains spoiler so I rather mark it!I've been waiting for this film since i was like 8 years old. I think i got my hopes up too high, but overall it was pretty good.The film doesn't really have anything to do with the games in terms of sequence, characters, story but i'll leave that out. Otherwise i'd have to give the film negative stars.I would have really liked a horror movie with jumpscares, death, violence, gore and blood. None of that was present in the movie so i don't understand the 16+ age rating.But hey, the end credits music even made me cry :') Has made me feel very nostalgic!",2023-10-29
"I'm not a fan of FNAF. But I used to play FNAF 1, 2 and 4. So the only thing that makes me watch the movie is nostalgia. But this story left a pleasant impression on me. The film impressed me in many ways. Okay, let me stop rambling here.PROS
The reason I was impressed with this movie was because I thought it was bad. But fun and funny. And I was kind of right (I'll get to that later in this review). But, wrong. I had a fun experience and would love to see it again!Another great aspect of this movie is the cinematography; the shots and coloring are effective and the atmosphere really give you the first FNAF game vibe which makes it feels nostalgic.I can also say that the plot is pretty good; quite confusing. But I'm happy with it.Then there is acting; I'm not saying the script is good (I'll get to that later in this review). But I can say that the four main actors in this movie (Josh Hutcherson, Piper Rubio, Elizabeth Lai and Matthew Lillard) did a great job conveying the emotions.Easter egg are amazing in this movie; If you've been a fan for a while, you'll love the Easter egg in this movie.I wanna say jump scares are the cons. But it feels like it was intentionally made to be goofy. I laughed so many times when jump scares shows up, and I could say it was a pros but still feels like a consCONS
Script on this movie is so weird; sometimes a scene is pointlessly long! And sometimes they just making a dumb move. There's a time when characters 1 disagrees with the decision of character 2. But character 3 agrees and ignores character 1. Then bad things happened. Later, character 3 is angry with character 1 for causing the accident and decides to threaten character 1. This is really strange to me. There are more problems with scripts.Finally, demographics. If you've never heard of or aren't a fan of FNAF, don't watch it. I'm serious. If you watch it, you will get bored of watching it. This is the problem, this films is really not for a person who don't know FNAF will like. Most likely, they will be bored watching it.CONCLUTION
I think this movie is a solid 7/10. If you are a fan of FNAF, I recommend seeing this movie in theaters. But if not, just watch it on Peacock.",2023-10-29
"While I can see why it may not be appealing to average viewers, those who followed the franchise through its many installments in the games and novels, this movie is fantastic. The story is meant to be convoluted and hard to wrap your head around. Hutchersons performance was nothing short of phenomenal and the way they fleshed out the character of Mike Schmidt was just great. He was much more than some voiceless security guard. Matthew Lillard as William Afton was great though he had little to no screen time. I would have really liked to have seen more of Lillard but the little we got was fantastic.",2023-10-27
"The fnaf movie isn't the best movie in the world obviously, however, it definitely captured what it felt like to play the games when I was like 9, and for a PG-13 rating they seriously did amazing! The actors and actresses did so freaking good, genuinely I was super happy, and the LORE AND PLOT TWISTS TO THOSE THAT THOUGHT THEY KNEW THE LORE WAS BEAUTIFUL! Yes, the movie seemed rushed a little bit by the looks of it, however, the entire storyline seemed rushed!, but lets face it, its still done incredibly well, and enough to keep pulling us in, and fully entertained. The beginning of the movie made me very nostalgic to be honest, the entire time I felt like I was living my childhood dream lol. THE ANIMATRONICS WERE SO GOOD! Genuinely they perfectly captured what I hoped they'd be! And not to mention they really did capture the whole ""the animatronics really are just little kids souls trapped in there"" thing. Some scenes hit way too close to home, while others were super wholesome and just added more to the movie. The kill scenes were incredible without displaying gore! They definitely got creative with it to display what the fans really wanted while again keeping it rated pg-13. Not gonna lie, I loved Vanessa's character, her actress did so freaking well! Her eyes were the most expressive through out the movie and despite the scenes where she was smiling, it was cool to wonder what she was thinking or feeling. Mike's character was also freaking incredible, he was hard to read expression wise, but then again, his character is sleep deprived and exhausted lol, but he also did amazing when it came to strong emotions needing to be delivered. William Afton was just as deranged and scary as I hope, and the scenes I looked forward to seeing most were in the movie, and just as beautiful as I had hoped. Anyways, that's my review! If you made it this far and haven't watched it yet and plan to, please stay til the end of the credits, there's always more.The other characters that weren't mentioned were also freaking incredible, but I also feel like Names are spoilers lol.",2023-10-29
"So the movie itself was all that i as a Fan expected it to be, it had most of the cameos and lines i wanted to hear and see. The movie looks great and the acting is fine but the story itself has some loose ends, and the plot twist at the end didnt realy feel like one, it feld forced, i have no idea how it would have been better though. To be fair i like i said am a Fan of the movie but i watched it with friends who arent fans and they were entertained by it, the point im trying to make is if you are a fan of the franchise i have no doubt you're gonna like this movie maybe even think its amazing, you're in for a great time, and if you arent a fan maybe even never heard of FNAF your still gonna have a good time with this movie if you look over the few, and not super in your face ""mistakes"". So, go watch the movie its gonna be a good watch!",2023-10-28
"Just saw FNAF with my friends! And we waited 8 years for this movie! And is the movie good? Yesss it is Great! Could it have been better? Yess it could at some parts! But overall it was amazing!The movie haves A Nostalgic and Sad vibe! I loved it.There are some Brutal scenes that were amazing !And that one thing fans want to see yess guys it happens!The cinematography Is amazing and stunning! I loved the cinematography and the visual effects the animatronics are fantastic!.The cast was amazing Everyone does a great job.I also loved the Easter eggs!Well what are the things that could have done better ? Well there could have been Some more scary scenes and with that I specially talking about the scenes were Mike was alone. It kinda annoyed me vannesa was again appearing the third night.But overall it was amazing and i I loved it! And I can't wait for the second movie ! If you a fan like
Me you gonna love it!",2023-10-28
"It is an all around amazing time it has soooooo many easter eggs you couldn't imagine i really hope there are more coming and when u watch it once u will want to watch it again and the gore is perfect for a pg13 they really stretched out that border between 15 and pg13.Also if ur a fan of youtube you'll love the little cameos that come in of some of your favourite creators but it sticks to the characters of the game so well and gives a twist on them it's a must watch my only thing i would improve is more spring trap screen time but there probably saving that huge character for the future of the movies.But WELL DONE BLUMHOUSE
AND GET UP AND GO SEE IT !!!!!!!!",2023-10-27
"I enjoyed every second, i thought it was a solid movie. Could it have been better sure, but i have no complaints. It looked phenomenal, between the sets and the animatronics i had a really good time just looking at this movie. The performances were great, the kid actors were creepy in a good way, i actually cared about the main characters, and felt tension when they were in trouble. I could nitpick about minor details or how things could be better, but i have no interest in doing that because i just had a good time watching it. This was easily one of the better video game movie adaptations ive ever seen.",2023-10-27
This movie was fantastic I loved it I saw it with one of my friends and we agreed the best movie of 2023 was this my first time seeing mappat the theater went crazy honestly very good movie tho they could've made it r but honestly I've waited for this movie since 2017 and it was worth the wait but some things needed a fix like the camera was choppy and not laggy it's pops around and some cheap jump scares but I love this movie and I highly recommend to watch this I hated some movies this year but this is the best I hope you find it helpful but I know the ending said come find me very good movie needs a sequel.,2023-10-28
"As someone whose heard of the game many times before but never played it I don't know the story or history of the franchise. All I know is what I saw in the movie and I will be rating it purely as a movie without any of the nostalgia or nods to the fans that the movie contains. That being said the storyline seemed really solid and was very interesting for me. I enjoyed it a lot and would definitely like to see it continued!The cast is amazing with Josh Hutcherson playing our main character Mike and the cute Piper Rubio playing his little sister Abby, great acting by them both. Josh especially really put on an amazing performance and brought his character to life for us on screen. Vanessa Monroe is played by the absolutely stunning Elizabeth Lail, my first time seeing her on screen but will definitely keep an eye out for her other movies with the incredible performance she gave us in this one. Matthew Lillard also does a great job with the few scenes his in and loved seeing him on screen again.The visual and sound effects were absolutely on point and I loved it all though the movie wasn't that scary really. I was definitely expecting a bit more in terms of the scare factor.Overall a well deserved 8/10 from me. Story was good, cast was amazing, absolutely loved the actors and their characters. The VFX and SFX were awesome as well. Only slight disappointment was I went in expecting it to be a lot scarier for sure.",2023-10-29
"I... Enjoyed this movie more than I'd like to admit, and I had fun, and would give it a solid 6/10 normally but there were simply parts I could not overlook. The animatronics were yes visually appealing but they always looked a bit... off, like they didn't quite fit into the room they were placed into with the exception of a few moments where the lighting was good, I enjoyed the references and a few moments made me even giggle or sit on edge, but overall it felt too... safe? Fnaf, in its original form, was an adult horror game that over time became popularized among kids and, to be frank, I felt like this movie exemplified this. Many of the horror scenes were cut shots of the aftermath or done in shadows with very little actual gore or anything to indicate injury, for example the first scene where it shows a previous guard getting ''Stuffed'' which has been replaced with a razor blade saw trap mask thing, was a cut away, the second scene where a character died it was a guy getting his face mauled off by the cupcake (Which I think it was utilized brilliantly), yet not a drop of blood was spilled? Yet the body later on is shown mangled and face gouged to bits... It felt like they were afraid to show the kills, however the one that killed this movie for me was the end. Spoiler alert William is here and he gets springlocked... In the most anticlimactic way ever. He gets shot and nothing happens (Through the lung and he just walks it off. Guy has the pain tolerance of Mike Tyson), yet when the CUPCAKE bit through his suits they started going off, and he kind of just... grunted? And a bit of blood was shown as it tore up his body... No agonizing death like in the game, no blood curdling scream, none of the pain of watching your whole body get ripped to shreds by metal slamming into it at high speeds as you're crushed.... just ""Oooh augh that stings, oh and you can't kill me I always come Back"" Before putting on the mask (Why? You're being crushed? Why would you put more spring locks on) and getting dragged off as he kinda lays there nonchalantly. This was THE climax and moment everyone was waiting for and it not just flopped, but dive bomb triple summer sault belly flopped.Overall fun movie but it simply fails to deliver at all in horror or a satisfying pay off. Despite all this I still highly recommend watching this as I KNOW They can do better next time.",2023-10-28
"As a non Five Nights fan and a non Blumhouse fan, I kept my expectations very low. But I must admit this film was not bad... even if it is just a copy of Willy's Wonderland. (I wonder how many fans I just triggered)Joking aside Five Nights at Freddy's was surprisingly enjoyable. It featured good characters, a good cast, and an interesting story.Unfortunately, a lot of these things, if not all, are underdeveloped and left a lot to be desired.The first two acts were slow and uneventful. My friend (the Five Nights fan) informed me that the first two acts contained a lot of lore. I am, however, not knowledgeable in any of it because I never played the games. Still, though, the story could have been developed faster and better.Irregardless, all the build up in the first two acts did pay off in a satisfactory third act.So if they intend to do a sequel, then I would say there needs to be a stronger development for story and characters. I can see they have a lot to play with, but they just need to utilize it better, especially if they want to attract new fans.Nonetheless, it's clear this film was made for the fans and little to no one else, and I can appreciate that. From the near sellout crowd in my showing, I can tell the fans loved it.IMDb: 6/10
Letterboxd: 3/5Watched in Theaters.",2023-10-27
"I am writing this the 3rd time i really hope imdb isnt gonna crash again. So I have been waiting for this movie for a while now and i finally got to see it today at the cinema premiere. The movie was good, I had lots of fun but it had 2 issues:1. It felt goofy at times
The way the animatronics moved was kinda silly sometimes, but that was not a big deal in comparasion with2. 0 lore accuracy
So this movie includes Mike Schmidt who is around 30 yo. A guy who was present in the fnaf 4 game which was in 1983. Another character is Vanessa who is from the security breach game who i believe it happens after 2025 so that would mean mike would have to be 50 by now. Also Mike keeps having that dream where someone kidnapped his brother but we know he killed him in 1983 so that also doesnt make sense. I dont think Vanessa had anything to do with William before the movie but i dont know what happens in security breach so i wont get into that i think i proved my point.The good parts are the cinematics who were amazing. The movie had nice angles and a mix of colors who gave a nice vibe. I also think the plot was good enough and the acting was great. Everyone in my theatre started to applaud when the springlock failure happened that was so cool, people were shouting all kinds of stuff. I had funOverall a 8.5
The movie is rated 5.8 right now but imdb ratings are always low for stuff that is not understood by everyone so i get it, not everyone likes fnaf.",2023-10-27
"It's not the easiest thing in the world to film an adaptation of such an iconic video game. As we already know they didn't succeed.The first question I asked myself is how are these 'creepy animatronics' supposed to scare people and bring suspense to the picture? At first they build a fort and then they lay on the ground like old friends. That totally ruined horror genre. Moreover, the jumpscares in FNAF looked like pathetic attempts to catch up.Also, some plotlines didn't look like finished to me. Why does Vanessa care so much about the pizzeria? What happened to Mike's mental problems? What's the point of aunt Jane in the film? Not sure if there's more FNAF films incoming, but it seems like too much crucial unanswered questions.Nevertheless, the cast wasn't the best in the world, but it was pretty decent. I also enjoyed the animatronics themselves and the adaptation of Freddy Fazbear Pizzeria. Probably those were the only highlights of FNAF.All in all, I'd only recommend this picture for the fans of the video game. It's also a great film for children who doesn't care about quality that much.",2023-10-27
"As a long-time FNaF fan, I loved this movie. I felt the writing, pacing and acting came together beautifully to create a movie that really does wonders to the diehard fans, and even newcomers. While I get that this movie could feel slightly hard to truly understand if you aren't already a fan of the franchise, but that was most likely the intention of the movie, as Scott Cawthon, creator of the FNAF franchise, both wrote and produced the movie. I do feel that the movie was easy enough to understand with no prior knowledge of the games as it explains all the crucial points of the story very well, in a way that still leaves speculation and doesn't hold your hand through everything in the film. It incorporates plot points from the books and games, as with some scenes it's clear it was inspired by the first book in the trilogy. Clearly the movie ratings feel otherwise, but that is to be expected when coming from people who have never seen anything else about the games. It is incredibly lore-accurate, and you can tell that the eight years this movie was in development for really paid off, in what can only be described as a love letter to the giant fanbase. The suspense and horror from the games translated to an extremely creepy adaptation, and even a horror fan such as myself found it suspenseful. The acting was superb as well, and Josh Hutcherson and all the other cast members outdid their roles in the film. Overall, while I understand this movie is not for everyone, it was still amazing for the fan, which was the entire point. If you do go and check out the film, I would recommend watching a YouTube video or two on the story of the franchise.",2023-10-28
"This movie met my expectations, I was not impressed or disappointed. The plot was altered from the game series; however, the story was told in a way that closely related to and respected the franchise and long-time fans. This movie was not straight horror, but for those familiar with the franchise, Five Nights at Freddy's tells a much deeper story than simple jump scares. That being said, the jumpscares in the movie were well spread out and moderately scary. There was a large family component in the movie that the books and the games both have, and it is unclear if some of the deeper meanings in the movie shine light on some of the secrets in the game. The story was well-paced; some dialogue clips seemed to be cut for time, but the movie itself wasn't rushed. The movie's theme is the same as the games: very family-based. The animatronic characters looked amazing! I was very impressed with the designs and shocked at how closely they resembled the in-game characters. The cast and acting were on point. Matthew Lillard may not be British, but he still pulled off a great William Afton. The dialogue was okay; it certainly wasn't jaw-dropping. Many long-time fans will spend most of the movie dissecting the dialogue to determine how similar the characters are to their in-game counterparts, as well as finding out the backstory of new characters. The backgrounds were really cool. The set was not the in-game building; however, that makes sense, considering the story was also altered. The atmosphere will feel familiar for long-time fans, and the setting has not changed drastically. The music and soundtrack were very nostalgic and definitely added to the ambiance. Overall, this movie is a great childhood throwback, but it falls short when compared to its game counterpart.",2023-10-28
"(listen closely to the Credits, if you know what I am talking about, you know what the future of the potential next movie looks like)I must start off and say, for this movie you shouldn't read through reviews like mine to know if it's good or not. A lot of the critics and reviews are rather negative. This a movie that you'll have to watch on your own to really make up your mind on how much you enjoyed/hated it.I have been a Five Night's at Freddy's fan since my pre-teen years and I must say, a lot of the Easter eggs hidden in the movie were there to be found by people who know about the lore and/or the drama that was happening in the past 9 years with this franchise.(SPOILERS ahead)
------------------------
The movie was creepy, it felt very uncomfortable at some points due to its brutal backstory and LORE. I really liked the whole cinematic. The location was absolutely amazing, the character's were perfectly designed and the acting was VERY GOOD. The cinematography was absolutely stunning and the sound design was directly inspired by the games, due to Scott Cawthon working with the team of Blukhouse to make this movie happen. A lot of popular YouTubers and influencers were part of this movie's production which I really liked, it just showed how much of a love project this was.Here come the cons tho. Due to me having a hyper fixation with the Five Nights at Freddy's lore, I wished for more misterious scenes, more brutality. I really wanted something brutal, more horror in the scenes that deserved it. Were some of the scenes showed were making me really uncomfortable, I really wished for more of a scare factor, I wished for the movie to really show how brutal and psychotic the misterious villain was and how he did not regret what he has done!So for the next movie, I would really wish for some more brutality (an R rating/ FSK18), seriousness and mistery, though I always like a bit of science fiction. Since jumpscared CANNOT be scary in movies (most of the times, in my opinion) make the movie very uncomfortable, I want the movie to make the audience look away because they cannot bare what is happening on screen, it doesn't have to be gory, but it should just show how brutal these murders were.This movie is definitely a must watch for every FNAF fan, horror fans and people who would like to get into the franchise, so even if it has some flaws, I will give it a solid 8/10I love FNAF, today I just relived my childhood again, thank you.",2023-10-26
"""In my personal assessment, the movie held its own in terms of quality, even though it fell short in delivering the expected levels of fright and gore. While it managed to maintain a certain level of engagement, it left something to be desired, especially for someone like me who anticipated a deeper exploration into the animatronics and the intricate history of the children involved. There was a sense of untapped potential, a feeling that the narrative could have unfurled into a more elaborate tapestry.Despite these reservations, I acknowledge that my familiarity with the game and its underlying lore could have influenced my perspective. For someone approaching the film without this background knowledge, it might come across as a solid piece of entertainment, free from the weight of unmet expectations. The characters, though not thoroughly explored, managed to convey a sense of depth, leaving room for viewers to imagine their own narratives.While it might not have fulfilled all the lofty hopes I had harbored, the movie nonetheless succeeded in offering an engaging cinematic experience. It prompted reflection on the complexities of adapting a beloved game into a visual narrative, a task laden with its own set of challenges. Ultimately, I walked away with a mixed sentiment, appreciating the effort while yearning for a more profound exploration of the source material's rich tapestry.""",2023-10-28
"This review is coming from someone who has only played the first 2 games.The Good: The characters in this were pretty likable. The pacing in the second and third act were very solid. The Acting was great. Also some of the kills were really cool.I personally thought the Five nights at Freddy's movie was really good. I don't think the film is perfect, though. The movie does have some issues, but it's still pretty enjoyable. Please don't expect that much blood or gore and that much jump scares. The pacing is slow in the first act, but it does get faster in the second act.Some moments were predictable. 7.5/10
It was good. I would watch it again.The 2 things that bugged me the most were the lack of screen time for William Afton and the lack of Jump Scares.",2023-10-30
"A faithfull recreation of the games world and impressive practical effects for the animatronics, anyone familiar with the early games will recognize the set ups, basic plot beats and even a particular youtuber who loves his theories.The acting is pretty good for the little depth they had to work with, overall plot is basic and functional to get the point across but that's about it.Horror wise it's pretty light on gore / scares and thrills, which is a shame, but it's still aimed at a young audience / young fans of the games. An r rated version would be nice for the adults (though willys wonderland with nic the cage did that already.Imo the film pulled it's punches but is still enjoyable and i was happy to see some key game lore references the ending is fine and leads in to the following games with freddies new addition to the ranks.CGI is also minimal but impressive.Music is well used and timed.",2023-10-29
Although it isn't what I expected I still think it was an movie. Like for an example the acting was crazy good and cgi wasn't that good but is still was decent and overall actors were pretty good and duration wasn't that good it should be an 2 hours 30 minutes Atleast and it's just above decent I recommend watching the movie but it's just isn't the best thing that you could watch in 2023 and it's kinda disappointing that I waited 8 years for that movie and it's just not good enough. I mean the movie is solid but I excepted more not blaming the producers they are hardworking people. Overall 8/10.,2023-10-27
"As a die-hard FNAF fan i loved this film, the setting, plot and atmosphere was perfect. The film has an amzaing soundtrack and brilliant acting as the actors are really invested into their roles. However the reason i have only given this a 9 is the ending the build up and reveal was perfect however i believe this ending was anticlimatic and left me feeling empty. This is because i feel it was a bit rushed due to time. This film didnt hold back on the gore which shocked me
However, if you are disapointed with the critic reviews don't be as this film is truly for the fans as i absolutly loved it.",2023-10-26
"An enjoyable watch especially if you have smaller siblings like the main character. It reminded me that I should take care and bond with my siblings more. Honestly, I thought this was going to be a mediocre movie because of all the negative reviews but it's actually not bad. My mom gives it a 6.5 and I give it a 7.5 which could've been higher if the movie was even better. These are the horror movies that are best to watch with family because it's a breath of fresh air. It's not the typical paranormal or bloody type of horror movie. It's the light horror-suspense type. One of the reasons why I like the movie is because the characters are nice people like Mike, Vanessa, and the pediatrician. Second, it's high quality! The set, the animatronics, the CGI, the cinematography, possibility for a sequel, the surprising cameo of a certain someone, and that killer music at the end! I loved that ending! That was cherry on top! Ahhh... I recommend this movie for FNAF lovers and families. I would've rated it higher if there was another certain cameo... But maybe next time.",2023-11-01
"Honestly not what I was expecting but was a fun night at the cinema nonetheless.The animatronics and set looked wonderful but I feel like there was so much missed opportunity story-wise.A good chunk of the storyline felt irrelevant and not relating to the games main lore at all. Take away all the strange stuff from the main FNAF story, (including whatever the hell fazgoo and remnant is) you have a geniunely interesting story about tragedy, betrayal and revenge.A massive nitpick I had was the time it was set. On the camera footage near the start of the movie, it says 2000, telling us this is set in the early 2000s. This is further backed up by the type of phones ans televisions used. This confused me though, as I thought Afton was springlocked in the early to mid 90s? And when we first meet Vanessa in the original games, it's in Security Breach which is clearly set in the future (I'm guessing 2030-2040) as the robots in-game have advanced AI personalites. If Vanessa is alive and looks around 20-30 in Security Breach, that would mean she wouldn't be around in the 2000s? How could Vanessa possibly be Afton's daughter if (as far as we know) he only had 3 children who all died?Many staples from the original line of games was missing too. Where is Henry Emily? How come we heard about Afton but not him? No mention of Fredbear's? Where's the bite? Phone guy??Not to mention how I felt Afton was just completely glossed over, like he appeared and we heard about the suit, and that he hid the bodies in the robots but that's it? HES THE MURDERER OF THE FRANCHISE, THE ONE THAT STARTED THE ENTIRE STORYLINE! Only to have a pretty short appearance before a really tame springlock scene.I do really hope if there are going to be other movies made, that they will explore other things about the main story with Fredbear's and the death of Afton's children, and I'd love to see a movie use Henry's FNAF6 speech.",2023-10-28
"I absolutely loved it! In fact everyone did in the cinema. We were cheering and gasping and laughing. Most ""community-esque"" cinema experience I've had since Endgame.What worked so well about this film was that, despite only being PG13, it really did a great job with the horror aspect. It nailed certain tonal shifts and had a heart-warming central story with Mike's family, Abby, and of course, Vanessa's clear trauma regarding Afton. Some real great characterisation, and I loved how it explained why the anamtronics are so hell-bent on hurting others.The resolution being the drawing was really well executed and set-up, and Matthew Lilliard's performance as Afton was chilling! I really loved the scene in his office at the beginning, the way he paused after reading ""Schmitt"" was so well done, and was a clear set-up.I can't wait to watch it again. There is definitely something to be said for how the film depicts the grief of Mike, and how each of the nights might represent a stage of grief surrounding his lost brother.I really hope they make a sequel, cause there is definitely potential for it!Oh and also, the cinema completely lost it when MatPat appeared. Really shows how much of an impact this game series/franchise has had on the current generation.So yeah. Overall an absolute stellar film that I really think will be appreciated more over-time by the general public, but will remain a fan-favourite for those who are already fans of the franchiseScore: 10/10.",2023-10-26
This film was based on a video game that's still popular to this day however in this movie I'm guessing the producers decided to change some of the story up a bit it's not what you expect but however the animatronics looked so real I mean the crew of the film did a good job with the special effects and also this movie has a few jumpscares however all together this movie was more cutesy than scary it was a little disappointing but hey even though it wasn't like the video game it was still entertaining so anyway I give this movie one thumbs up I wonder if there will be a sequel I don't know who knows.,2023-10-29
I am not a fan of horror movies but I still decided to watch Five Nights at Freddy's just because I had seen some gameplay of the games and wanted to see how the movie shows the animatronics. And I really liked that they used actual animatronics instead of using CGI which gave it a sense of realism. If you are expecting this movie to be bone-chilling scary then you will be disappointed. But what holds your attention till the end of the movie is the story of the security gaurd Mike and his sister Abby and mystery of his brother Garrett. You start liking the main characters which makes you care for them. The climax could've been better. Overall its a one-time watch.,2023-10-28
"In Five Nights at Freddy's, the only thing that really deserves praise is the story, its elements, and the revelations at the end. Also, I praised Hutcherson's performance because he made the person who is watching live with the character and understand its mentality and the way he thinks and behaves and why he thinks and behaves like that. The same thing applies to Lail's performance and cinematography.But other than that, everything else was very normal. The screenplay, direction, horror elements and jumpscares, soundtrack, and performances of the rest of the cast did not have anything special in them.Also, I didn't like the unclear and un-understandable ending.Also, I wished that the movie was rated R because it would have been better if it had more violence, gore, horror elements and jumpscares. But unfortunately, that did not happen. That is why when it comes to the score, I give Five Nights at Freddy's 5 out of 10.",2023-10-27
"Before seeing the film, I saw multiple reviews on how boring and unenjoyable the film was, but I found the movie to be very good. It was full of fun Easter eggs and nods to the game franchise and it's community and had a good storyline and everything the characters did felt reasonable. The film wasn't full of blood and gore, but this was due to it needing to appeal to FNAF's main audience, which is children and teenagers. It still had some bloody and a few disturbing scenes, without feeling like it was forcing it in to the film. I feel that the movie as a whole was fun and it did well to replicate the story of the games, whilst also creating new parts of the story so fans of the game can get something new from it.",2023-10-26
"This Movie was everything I had hoped for and more. It is a masterpiece in both story and cinematography. If you are a FNAF fan this movie is perfect for you, it follows the fnaf story and if you actually pay attention unlike the critics you will see that the story DOES make sense and that everything is as I dreamed. The gore isn't overplayed which I like and the tensions do get high. I was worried when I saw that the animatronics were friendly but it is revealed that they are friendly because william wants to use the animatronics to kill her, you know, what he does in the movies AND games? Honestly this film is amazing and the critics reviews just point out how incompetent and stupid movie critics are, as they don't understand the source material or the movie at all.",2023-10-27
"""Five Nights at Freddy's"" is finally here after 8 years of development hell and what did I think of it?Let me start off with the good. The animatronics are great. They look so good and faithful and the puppetry is also really well done. The performances are also pretty good. Josh Hutcherson does a really great job and his character was pretty well fleshed out. The directing as well is also really good. We get some pretty nice shots along with some really creepy lighting. There's a decent amount of bloody shots for a PG-13 movie which I really appreciated. There's a great scene involving people breaking into Freddy's which I thought was well done. And finally I thought the final 15 minutes was good, along creepy with some creepy scenes.Now this is far from a perfect movie it does have quite a few problems. The first being the PG-13 rating. This movie would have benefited from an R rating. It needed more. The script also is a mess. It's a bit repetitive at times with a subplot involving dreams and it felt very redundant. I thought the character of Vanessa felt very unimportant from the movie. And finally I would have liked a bit more animatronic mayhem.Overall despite a messy story and some odd choices, ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" offers enough that kept me satisfied.",2023-10-26
"I absolutely loved the film... it was more than what I expected the acting was really good and visually a masterpiece, the animatronics looked soo good and the sets were just amazing... And you could say that the kids acting was a bit iffy but they're kids, you can't expect them to be as good as Matthew Lillard.Having said that I would like to talk more about the plot of the movie as a long time fan of the games/novels I was expecting to not get surprised by the movie's lore since it's based on the games but surprisingly the movie's twist on some parts of the lore was amazing for example when it's reveled that Vanessa's dad is William Afton, since in the games Michael Afton is the son of William Afton...The movie was so enjoyable, and you could say some parts were cringe for example when the animatronics do a sleeping fort with Abby but you have to understand that the whole function of the animatronics was to entertain children so it makes total sense for them to like Abby... And you could also say that the movie was not that scary, that it wasn't so focused on the scare factor but this could be a personal take but I wasn't mainly focused on the scary stuff, yes some jump scares did scare me, but I would say that as an audience we weren't mainly going for the scary stuff, we were going because of nostalgia and well because it's FNAF...Finally, to sum it all up I think that this movie was really good it may had some bumps but not all movies are perfect... Either way I loved this movie, it made me fell like a kid again which I loved, the feeling of this movie will have a close place in my heart.",2023-10-27
"FNAF delivers on all fronts. Superior special effects animations, cinematography, production, and directing. It breaks all the rules of trying to follow formulas or jump scares simply for shock value. This movie reminded me of the genius of Jeepers Creepers 1 and 2 and how those movies were genuinely creepy, atmospheric, and scary through natural situations and not cinematic setups to try and sell you on SHOCK VALUE. FNAF brilliantly executes an atmospheric storytelling form and the violence has real reason behind it and isn't your typical mindless acts of gore and ridiculous bloodbaths you see in standard horror movies that rely on those cheap kinds of tricks and methods to sell you on its violent horror value. My daughter and I loved this movie and it is a fan pleaser. A fantastic adaptation with some surprisingly emotional and moving moments.Critics continue to hilariously embarrass themselves by trying to fit in with the BROKEN SYSTEM of narcissism and cynism that has become the..... movie criticGO SEE IT.... IT'S A HALLOWEEN WINNER 🏆",2023-10-29
"It was such a good movie i laughed, cried, and was shocked at parts. I hate that it ended on a cliffhanger though. Im glad the movie ended right for mike and abby. Also i love how they added many game lore in one movie. It was a little gorey but not bad only a bit if blood rhat shines, quite a few jumpscares perfect for the movie since it's based off the games. I hope we get a sequel for Vanessa's sake also William alway comes back. It made my 6 year old self very happy. 💗💗💗 great to watch in the dark too. Could have had explained lore better but they had certain amount of time so obviously not their faults.",2023-10-31
"I never expected this movie to be some kind of great masterpiece or perfect adaptation of the original games (even the new game security breach failed to adapt it) since the original games were very basic and their story was created on the fly with new releases by the author and theorists. Whole atmosphere of the original game was that of a dream, location made sense but not the layouts of rooms, some things in the background just changed at random and you come back for some reason every night. If you really had to adapt it faithfully it would probably look like something similiar silent hill 4 or 2 (in tone atleast).That being said this movie was ok, it established why the main character wants to spend 5 nights and i found the whole plot with his dreams somewhat interesting, i had couple of laughs and liked the set design. It had a basic story and i am glad that they kept it that way since the original lore is tangled since like i mentioned it was created on the fly just to feed the theorists. Overall a very averge but enjoyable movie, glad that it isn't a train wreck but it isn't also something to write home about, definitely more enjoyable than the mention security breach though.",2023-10-29
"I do both, so I'll give it a 5 for balance. Could have certainly been worse, but it's a shame the scripts and plot didn't match the visuals or dream concepts. Horror stuff was fine but pretty light and not that scary (likely due to the rating holding it back a bit). Finally, the adaptation from the lore and games is a decent. In summary its, good for a blum movie but should've and could've done more for me as a movie enthusiast first and a fnaf fan second. Also there are a couple cameos to look for since I need to mention something to pad out this review. P. S. Carmen's Bizet/the Freddy theme isn't really in the movie either, which was a bit of a disappointment, but other game sounds do get included.",2023-10-31
"Just got back two hours ago from seeing the movie and my opinion about the movie is amazing. The designs for the animatronics look amazing and all the characters were phenomenal in my opinion. Never thought anyone could find a way to bring this loved Franchise and do it right until I watched the movie tonight. It has some funny moments, and I would say there is some gore but it's not like over the notch type gore. Every moment of this movie I enjoyed and smiled like a kid while watching it. I grew up with the game and smiled every minute of the movie to see this on the screen. The cameos are amazing.",2023-10-28
"Best peak credit scene yes.""Five Nights at Freddy's,"" the popular indie horror game series that has haunted players for years, finally makes its long-awaited debut on the big screen. Directed by auteur filmmaker Chris Columbus, this film adaptation successfully captures the eerie and suspenseful atmosphere of the games, while also offering a fresh take on the franchise.One of the strengths of ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" lies in its adherence to the source material. The movie stays true to the game's central premise: a night guard, in this case, played by a convincingly terrified actor, is tasked with surviving a week's worth of night shifts in a sinister, animatronic-filled restaurant. The tension is palpable as the audience, like the protagonist, is forced to confront the unsettling presence of the animatronics and solve the mysteries that shroud Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.The film also successfully creates a sense of nostalgia for fans of the game, featuring all the iconic animatronic characters and incorporating elements of the game's lore. This attention to detail will undoubtedly please long-time fans while remaining accessible to newcomers.Chris Columbus deserves praise for his direction. He masterfully builds suspense and dread through a combination of chilling cinematography, dark and claustrophobic set design, and a hauntingly atmospheric score. The jump scares are well-executed, making the audience jump out of their seats more than once.The movie's pacing, however, can feel somewhat uneven. There are moments where the tension builds to a fever pitch, only to be interrupted by brief lulls in action. Some may find these lulls necessary for character development, but they can slightly disrupt the otherwise intense atmosphere.The performances in ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" are commendable. The cast, including the night guard and supporting characters, deliver solid performances that help the audience connect with the story. The animatronic designs and their terrifying movements are truly the stuff of nightmares, enhancing the overall experience.While the film effectively brings the game's chilling aspects to life, it leaves some questions unanswered and may leave viewers divided on the conclusion. However, this open-endedness might be intentional to leave room for potential sequels.In summary, ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" is a worthy adaptation of the beloved game franchise. It delivers on its promise of tension, terror, and nostalgic references while also serving as a standalone horror experience. For fans of the games and horror enthusiasts alike, this film is an enjoyable and suspenseful journey into the world of Freddy Fazbear.",2023-10-27
"SO, I have been a MASSIVE FNAF Fan since I got Security Breach for my birthday last year, and when I saw the teaser trailer for the movie, I WAS HYPED, but I kept my expectations low, the entire time.I just watched the movie on Peacock and MY GOODNESS, IT DID NOT DISAPPOINT! This was an amazing movie in my opinion. I loved the characters, and the animatronics looked so real, amazing job Jim Henson's Creature Shop!There were some scares that made me jump from my seat, and there were some very funny moments. I was beyond impressed with the springlock scene, the suspense for me was spot on, and when he said, ""I always come back,"" I cheered loudly!Abby was a very interesting character, but I loved her. She was hilarious. When the FNAF 1 song played during the end credits, I screamed in joy, and sang along to the song, it was AWESOME! I really don't care AT ALL what critics say about this movie, I loved this movie start to finish, heck, I've even made some ideas for sequels and spinoffs for crying out loud.Blumhouse, you did an amazing job with this movie, from start to finish, even without CGI! This brought so much Nostalgia, and I am so watching this again, and this movie needs a sequel!Well done Jason Blum, you have impressed me once again...can't wait for FNAF 2 if you make it an actual movie and a sequel to this one.",2023-10-27
"The setting can sometimes be very well done, but we went from being in a hostile situation of a girl being cut into two pieces, to a sleepover with the animatronics, in many moments it became predictable with the screamers at random moments and a plot that From the beginning you know how it will end. I was quite disappointed but going with expectations at 0 relieved me a little.Another point that I would like to highlight is that there were boring secondary characters who did not make much contribution, plus the villain was the most cliché thing in a horror movie.There were a couple of loose ends left and they didn't give a specific end (probably because they want to release a sequel) And as a fan of FNAF and horror movies, I feel that it fell quite short, both as a terrorist film and as an adaptation.If you are not a big fan of both genres, it will probably impress you at various times.",2023-10-26
"As a big fan of the franchise this is my review: The fnaf movie was one of the best produced and directed movies I've watched in a long time. All this work and dedication that has been put into this movie has been washed out with bad critics. The critics are probably 50 or smt years old and probably call it ""Friday nights at freddys: The movie"". The point I'm trying to put out to people is that the movie is amazing and for it not be overseen by all the bad critics and reviews. + rotten tomatoes, they always put good movies down and people look up to it. YOU should be the one rating this movie bc after all ""Its for the Fans"". I'm defending this so much bc I've waited so long for this move to come out and it doesn't need the hate it has gotten. Still will be a jem in my heart!I could write more but my hands are hurting so yk, GO WATCH IT!!",2023-10-25
"The long awaited Five Nights at Freddy's movie adaptation is finally here and despite it being more of a thriller mystery, than a horror movie I loved it to be completely honest. Being a fan of the games definitely helps, but I think it does a good enough job at presenting an interesting story that is intertwined with the FNAF lore. There are some really solid performances in here especially Josh Hutcherson who has some really subtle and emotional acting that doesn't feel over the top, Matthew Lillard as always gives a over the top but not to over the top performance; and finally the little girl who plays Abby was also very good, overall I recommend this movie and think that its a great movie. Rating: 8.5/10. (IMHO)",2023-10-31
"It stuck to the story of the video game pretty well but they changed it in places it needed to for the sake of translating to film. Not super gory or overly scary but had a nice and creepy feel overall with some jump scares and a few good kill scenes.All of the actors did a great job, especially Josh Hutcherson. Over all the writing, acting, cinematography, everything about the movie was wonderful and plus the animatronics were FANTASTIC!I'd say it a good movie for teens/older kids or for people who maybe get too scared with more intense horror. But really everyone who likes scary movies or was in to the game snooks watch this!",2023-11-01
"Taking a beloved indie horror game, one that's been scaring the pants off of gamers for years, and turning it into a movie is no small feat. But in my opinion, they did a seriously solid job. Blumhouse, Universal, and Emma Tammi deserve massive props.Now, let's address the elephant in the room. Is this movie perfect? Well, no, there are a few loose ends and some things could have been beefed up for the wider audience. Definitely could have been scarier and it might have benefited from a longer runtime. But come on, folks, don't tear it to shreds like it's a crime against humanity. Critics that bodied this movie, like they're hunting for Oscar-worthy masterpieces, need a reality check. We've seen way too many folks drop the ball with cherished IPs, and this film is nowhere near the dumpster fire it could have been.Again, It's a SOLID film that manages to blend some horror and a PG-13 rating fairly well. You get decent chills and jaw-dropping moments without excluding a broader younger audience. The cast, especially Josh Hutcherson, knocks it out of the park. Seriously, that guy nailed it.But what bugs me is the negativity for the sake of being polarizing. It's like people want to stand out and get clicks by hating on it. Come on, that's just disingenuous. Reviewing this without considering its lore-rich roots is like eating pizza without cheese - you're missing the point!The film managed to tap into some emotional and traumatic elements, and I wanted more of that, to be honest. I actually think the film was better being a drama mystery horror than a straight slasher. Also, it's worth noting that FNAF is far from an agreed-upon cohesive story. YouTubers have made their entire careers out of solving the mystery of FNAF. So taking on the daunting task of writing a complete film is NOT EASY. Emma Tammi told a complete holistic FNAF story (not without some odds and ends for sure), and I think they nailed bringing those 8-bit minigames and lore-filed newspaper clippings to cinematic life.I was in the theater, and I felt the beats and those special moments that got cheers and applause. The set design, costumes, and the whole package were breathtaking, honestly. You could see the care and thought that went into this film, and that's what excited me the most. They listened to the fans and made it happen.In the end, Five Nights at Freddy's delivered. It's a testament to love, care, and the understanding of an IP's roots, all while creating an actual, enjoyable movie. I was genuinely worried they'd mess it up, but they didn't. So, here's to rewatching it every Halloween and eagerly awaiting more sequels.",2023-10-27
"Saw ""Five Nights at Freddies"" last night. I have played the first game, but none of the sequels. So as someone with limited familiarity with the brand, I found the film pretty accessible. It also did the impossible by making a specific jump-scare into a running gag that legitimately made me laugh. The acting was (mostly) solid, the lore was interesting if not a bit cheesy, and the animatronics all looked great (tho I personally wanted them to look more creepy). Oh, and I hear it only had a $20M budget, so kudos for stretching that budget as well as they did! I give this film *6/10* - soft recommendation.",2023-10-27
"So I personally was surprised by the reviews that this movie received, before watching it all I knew was that people thought it wasn't great. I thought it was amazing, with a title like FNAF production produced the best result for the fans of the series. This movie has no intention of being an masterpiece but that being said it isn't poorly made, it's high quality and you can tell that a lot of work was put into every scene but it was made for the fans.I really liked this movie because FNAF has been around for a while, when I was younger like everyone else, I loved FNAF I thought it was so cool and it still is. FNAF is for the younger people but there's also older people who really enjoy it too so it's really for everybody.When I watched this movie in theaters the entire theater was filled with teenagers and it felt like a really friendly environment because everyone there loves FNAF. In fact when the movie ended the whole theater started clapping even though it wasn't the best movie everybody in there was satisfied with what they saw. Audience reactions to the cameos were cool too.At the end of the day I think I was glad that the movie didn't try too hard to be something it wasn't and instead stuck to what the series embodied in a community sense. It was something people liked.",2023-10-29
"This movie is exactly what we wanted ever since it was announced 8 years ago, and it was worth the wait.It has a very good story that isn't the same as the games but it's close enough to be a FNAF movie, it doesn't feel like it's just a random story with FNAF characters in it, and that's so relieving as a fan.There's a pretty good amount of bloody imagery and gore for a
PG-13 movie, some people seemed to expect more, but then again, it is PG-13, they added all they could without making it R-rated, and that's fair, there's plenty of people under the age of 18 who love FNAF a lot, and in the games there aren't much bloody or gore imagery anyways, in fact I think the only time we see blood and gore in FNAF are in the form of Atari style minigames, the FNAF 1 death screen (not too much showing) and FNAF 3 rare screens.The critics on other sites are too harsh on this movie, definitely don't listen to them, watch it for yourself, make your own opinion, whether you're a fan or not, it's going to be worth watching, even if you don't go to the theaters and watch it at home on Peacock instead, you won't regret it.",2023-10-27

"Visuals: 9/10 🔥
Fan Service: 9/10 😱
Acting : 7/10 🙂
Story : 6/10 👍
Horror : 3/10 😔I have been eagerly waiting for this film for years, as an avid fan since 2014. And I got to say this film!... is around the exact level of quality I expected.My main take away, this film definitely makes a few strange decisions that I really think hinder what is otherwise an excellent film. The cupcake, the taxi scene and the Vanessa plot twist to name a few.However! As an audience I feel we have gotten too obsessed with bite sized moments and short scenes, acting as though a few inklings of cringe can ruin a two hour experience. 90% of this film is outstanding, visually beautiful and well directed, and I would happily watch it again.",2023-10-29
"I think the movie was great, at least for the fansIt also has a lot of references to books and a lot of things, I enjoyed it
but the movie was for fans either from 2014 or 2023 and it was almost obvious that critics were not going to like itI don't know what the fans of 2014 and those of now think, but for me it was beautiful, I can't express how much I liked it, it was like I was playing the games again for the first timethe best feeling...The only thing I have to say as a fan since 2014 is that I love the movie, because FNAF was my childhoodand no critic is going to change my love for the movie.",2023-10-28
"The creepy doll attack continues. This time the video game, which I never heard of, get his own movie and though probably some of this game fans will get furious from their own reasons, I have found this horror film quite entertaining.If I wouldn't read about the fact this movie is based on a successful video game I would have thought it was rather original and interesting, with its plot and story. It has some characters that do not go anyware and their story doesn't evolve, but the main character's story stays pretty solid.There is a lot of low logic parts at this movie and the fact that when the night shift ends the movie goes to black screen and then declares on another day doesn't improve it, but it flows.The idea (whether it is based on the game or on the screenwriter's interpretation) is fresh, pretty audience grabber and stick through the whole movie and you found yourself intrigued, though you understand that the script is not tight as it should be.Josh Hutcherson is back, in a way, and he is great. It is also nice to see Matthew Lillard gets old as any other guy and the movie does a great job with holding a base line concept of the genre with a twist of its own.The platform and flow are generic, but it is the small idea and performance which let him stand out a little bit and take us to this full journey and actually finish it with a good feeling and impression.",2023-10-30
"So.. this movie has some things i need to adress. First of all the lack of gore, this movie has a lot to give and i know a lot of people didnt want this movie because of the jumpscares, horror or gore, they wanted it for the lore, but i still think some gore or horror is needed. Second of all the lore is a lot. When i walked into the cinema i had a pretty good understanding of the lore but when i walked out i was the most confused i have ever been, i think the lore of this movie was less about the fnaf franchise and more about something else and that very good, some new lore to the story but still i think they made way to little about the current lore and confirmations of certain theorys. But besides all that the movie was very good just not what i expected.",2023-10-26
"I was not expecting much from this movie to be fair, even though I really liked the FNAF games. I know they changed some of the lore around but honestly it was all a good way to tie a story together a make it into a palatable movie. It was not that scary to me, but my son thought it was pretty scary.I had a couple of gripes around Vanessa but I blame the writing on that, like the first night she showed up, Mike didn't ask her why there was a police officer there, etc. Just minor things like that. I was also expecting her to be a villain, but it didn't turn out this way, at least in this movie.I really liked Spring Bonnie and the big reveal on that! It was like the final Boss in the game if it had a final Boss. Honestly that was my favorite part of the movie.I know they left it open for future movies and I look forward to seeing those too.Not sure why there are so many bad reviews.",2023-10-27
"I saw an early showing and can say this may easily be my favorite movie of 2023. The casting was perfect. They gave us so many things that we wanted, with a good dose of things we didn't know we needed. Some lore doesn't line up but not major plot points to the series. It isn't so much horror as it is suspense. But it worked perfectly fine without the gore! There are still bits to give you the classic FNaF jumpscares and some visible kills. Like most FNaF creations, there were so many background details that you could definitely watch it more than once and still find something new. Honestly an amazing film all around!",2023-10-27
What a disappointment. So much focus on the backstory that it feels more like a sob story than a horror movie. It had a couple moments of excitement in the beginning and in the last half where I was genuinely fired up but those were literally the only moments.It's such a shame because they recreated the visuals from the game so beautifully but they forgot what makes the games exciting. It's the whole idea of never knowing where these things will show up next. Hearing them moving around the place wondering whether they'll attack. Things like that are almost completely absent. It's all about the backstory.When things finally start happening the movie is almost over so there's literally nothing.,2023-10-28
I like this take on the fnaf universe. It's certainly different from the games and books but it still captures the idea of the universe really well. The suspense and action was really good. Every turn kept me on the edge of my seat. The plot twists were incredible and unexpected. My friends and i love the movie. We couldnt stop looking shocked. The audience that we veiwed with loved it too. The animatronics looked incredible. Its amazing how they brought them to life so realistically. The ending opened up for a sequel and i look forward to seeing it. The main antagonist william afton was portrayed perfectly. He was creepy but in a cool way. The suit/costume was perfection. I love how they brought the games and books to life.,2023-10-27
"This movie was absolutely incredble for the fans, amazing story, amazing music, amazing acting, 10/10, would recommend for any fnaf fan! New or old!The characters being brought to life by Jim Hensons creature shop was absolutely incredible to witness on the big screen, Freddy bonnie chica and foxy all looked INCREDIBLE as well as Golden Freddy and Springbonnie, I am incredibly eager for the sequel, there were some things that needed addressing in the movie but I'm confident in Scott Cawthon and Emma Tammi to review these things for the future, Once again, INCREDIBLE MOVIE, WORTH THE 8 YEAR WAIT!",2023-10-27
"I won't go too in depth with this review, but I will say it absolutely sucks the kinds of reviews people are leaving. As with any movie based off a game, the franchise's legacy is what most of the film plays off of. Yes, you could watch the film without knowing context, but it of course falls flat since the format of the story is meant to be more immersive and experienced from a 1st person POV.The visuals in this film were stunning, and it mostly stayed true to the games, with a few changes to make it fit a film format. The storytelling was alright, but definitely fell flat in its script (a bunch of cheesy lines and some cliche film tropes). Overall however, it was a fantastic film for any FNAF fan.If I was rating the film from a critic standpoint, yeah it'd be a 6/10, but from an audience standpoint (with context to the lore) it was honestly up there. Plenty of films this year have fell flat in comparison (especially Halloween films), yet are highly rated (7.0+) so I'm not sure wht people give this 5 stars.",2023-11-02
"I'm very biased and definitely overlooking the flaws of the movie because I was so excited to see it. SO excited that I watched 8 hours of a 9-hour long lore video right before seeing it.One of the parts I remember the best was the Dream Theory scene near the beginning. It was a funny little nod to the fans and the fandom's history.I am always enamored with movies that use puppets instead of CGI (like the first Jurassic Park). The animatronics in this movie are BEAUTIFUL. I saw some videos of YouTubers who were invited to the movie set and got to see the animatronics, and I was so jealous.There were some parts where you could obviously tell there were limitations with the physical animatronics. I really wanted to see Foxy sprinting down the hallway in the cold open but alas. I do think that this was overall a good choice since the alternative would probably reduce the visual quality of the film.For the most part, my favorite thing about the movie is that it simply has been something for me to be excited about. I've been reminded of a lot of memories from when I was super into the games at, like, 9-10 years old. This movie was a soft, warm embrace of nostalgia.",2023-10-27
"As an og fan I think this included everything that I could possibly want! Ofc the horror part of the movie wasn't that big but it is a pg-13 movie with the new fnaf kids coming in the mix it was a given. Spring trap was horrifing it gave me so many chills when I saw him and piecing averything together screaming at the tv for the first time ever in my life at a movie I think it deserves a 10/10. Only thing I would have changed is a appearance from markiplier, but having matpat in it was pretty amazing. Ps love all of the little references in the movie like the celebrate poster and the places that the animatronics hide.",2023-10-27
"It's been mentioned in other reviews, but if you aren't a fan of the franchise, you won't understand the story of what's going on. Otherwise, I found the movie to be very faithful to long-time fans of the games.I'd been waiting to see this movie since it was first announced in 2015, and I was beginning to think it would never happen, due to all the setbacks and delays. But I'm so glad it did happen, and here we are seeing the fruits of everyone's labour who worked tirelessly hard on the movie.A few inconsistencies/missing bits of information dragged it down a bit, but mostly the movie was true to the source material. Five Nights at Freddy's has always been heavily lore based, so it was nice to see bits and pieces of it sprinkled throughout the film.The animatronics are spectacular, visually, and look exactly how they do in the first game. I also ADORE that they put time into making the animatronics from scratch, without heavily relying on CGI. That, paired with the beautifully made sets, makes the movie even better, and much more realistic and loyal to the source.It's not exactly considered scary - albeit some parts are a bit bloody and gruesome. The creepiness of FNAF stems more from aesthetic than from physical violence, so the movie does well on that front. Adding brief scenes of humour in the movie also makes it entertaining to watch.I do think they could've added a brief scene somewhere near the start where we get to see Foxy doing his infamous dash down the hallway to the security guard's office - a favourite amongst fans of FNAF.",2023-10-29
"I know, I know, the bar for video game movies is REALLY, REALLY low.First of all, I'm NOT A FAN of FNAF. I think I played the game for like a couple of hours a few years ago.Now, ""one of the best live action video game movies""? Street Fighter? Bob Hopkins' Super Mario? Those were bad. Are Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil and Hitman decent? It's subjective, people will have different opinions.But no movie is like ""wow, this video game movie is amazing, 10/10"". So this one stands out as ""decent"".It's a PG-13 movie, so there's no gore, little blood, not much violence, but it's entertaining, it's a throwback to old classics, like Chucky, or Nightmare on Elm Street, but PG-13. It's a movie for pre-teens or teens who are just starting to like horror. The story is decent, the movie is entertaining, kids were enjoying it a lot (I went with my 11yo niece and she loved it). It has a plot twist and post credits scene. Only few jumpscares (I thought there were going to be a lot of them) and a few iconic and creepy moments for fans and a lot of references (I missed a few because as I said, I'm not a fan and I'm not familiar with the lore).7/10.",2023-11-02
"Seeing the reviews from critics and the PG rating i kind of expected it to just be a fun movie of maybe mediocre quality. It exceeded those expectations by so far. They did an awesome job staying true to the source materials while making the changes necessary to make a good movie. It had the spirit of the games, had some genuinely scary parts, and was so much higher quality than I expected. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and didn't want it to end. All of the main actors did a great job, very impressive performance from the child actors. The changes made left just enough questions for speculation, much like the games did. Real fans of the series will love this movie and I don't expect it but I came out of this hoping for a sequel. So many well done references to the actual gameplay. The one warning I would give is that this should not have been rated PG. I'd say PG-13 at a minimum. The majority of the movie was very intense and some graphic violence. (spoilers coming) the final scenes with William Afton/Claptrap, while being some of the less gory, were especially disturbing. Partially because of how good an actor Mathew Lillard is. There is a scene where multiple adults are killed and while we don't see the deaths clearly on screen you see hints to it, including a shadow showing a woman being cut in half. Later in the movie these people are shown as decomposing corpses, clearly. There is also the element of violence to children and while they don't show any children being hurt on screen it could disturb some viewers. I definitely wouldn't let my child watch this until at least 13, it was truly horror.",2023-10-27
"I loved the movie more than I can say.It was literally seeing my childhood on the screen.The animatronics were played amazingly, it's hard to remember that they're puppets.The cupcake had some semi-janky scenes, but I still loved them regardless.Partially the movie, but I also loved seeing the rest of the audience just as excited for the movie as I was at vital scenes such as:1. The start screen of the movie2. MattPatt's cameo and of course,
""It's just a theory"" -MattPatt3. The best scene of all, the spring lock scene
It was very satisfying to watch, especially with the scene after in the back room.",2023-10-28
"I went into the theatre not thinking very highly due to very low critic review. However, this movie was a great experience and was incredibly fun to watch with my friends. Had some great references to the games and creators who played the game. I honestly don't understand how you could rate this movie anything below a 10/10. The critics who rated this poorly honestly need to stop overanalyzing everything and need to just have a good experience instead of nit-picking about things that don't even matter in the long run. Overall this movie was incredibly fun and didn't deserve to be so horribly rated.",2023-10-28
"Five Nights at Freddy's is hands down, the most fun I've ever had watching a film in a long time, because of how bad it is. There are so many plot holes and things that happen, that leaves me pissing myself in laughter. Each time a new plot hole was left, I was left laughing hysterically, and the film overall had no idea what the hell it wanted to be. It didn't know if it wanted to be a horror movie, a silly funny movie, or whatever. The movie is hilarious to watch and is a fantastic ""so bad its good movie"", but it is not at all a good movie. Like, I seriously cannot watch this movie as a horror movie, it is a comedy. If that is what it was going for, then it succeeded, but any element of seriousness is completely lost, with the last act being a treat. If you're a FNAF fan (like my younger self), then you'll like it for its callbacks, and it serves very well for a representation for the franchise. If you're wanting to see a horror movie, do not even touch with a ten foot pole. If you wanna watch a movie that is ""so bad its good"", then this movie has it. Will watch again, with a lot of friends.",2023-10-28
"The overall movie from the perspective of a long term fan (since I was 7 in 2014) met most of my expectations. I couldn't sit still in my seat the entire time and truly enjoyed the experience. Of course I'm not saying this movie is perfect for it could be improved a lot. The overall plot and organization of the movie is messy and a tad sloppy that it would confuse new fans and people who have no background knowledge of the lore, however from the viewpoint of a theorist and hardcore fan, this wasn't an issue. Like I said, the movie could use improvements.The reason I wanted to write this review was to explain a bit to what the 4 star and less reviews are lacking in terms of the movie.The thing about these reviews is that they highlight details like how there isn't much gore, how it is inaccurate to the lore, the springlock scene isn't the same as the games, Vanessa's father is William Afton, and Mike.I would like to clear up these claims for anyone who is planning on watching the movie and is doubting it based off these reviews. First off I'd like to say is that a lot of these bad reviews come from people who know nothing or little about the lore, or if anything not enough. True, the movie could contain more gore, however keep in mind Scott is trying to make the movie available to the majority of the fans, who are now in their mid-late teens or young adults. Making it more than it is would make it rated R. Here in my country the movie is rated 15. Like I said, gore and scare factor could have been increased a bit more while still keeping it away from Rated R.Now the part people are confused about, the lore. All I can say is that the movie seems to be referencing the books more than the games (with some reference to the games of course). Such as the animatronic who looks like Ella from -1:35 am-, the springlock scene from -The Silver Eyes- (pg. 187 in the graphic novel), the arcade scene with foxy also from -The Silver Eyes- (pg. 175-176 graphic novel), the use of electricity to short circuit the animatronics (pg. 172 graphic novel -The Silver Eyes-), same looking security monitors as shown in -The Silver Eyes- graphic novel again pg. 126, and lastly the scene where the animatronics dance weirdly pg. 86.Last part since I cant go into much detail, Mike Schmidt and Michael Afton are not yet confirmed to be the same person. Although I do believe they might be, I was also in quite shock hearing that Vanessa is the daughter of William, like what???? This is Scott we're talking about, of course he'd pull something like this on us and its our job to figure out what the true lore is. People saying that its impossible since Vanessa comes from security breach way later on in the future have a point, but then again are we really confident about the timeline at this point...In conclusion, great movie for a fan who knows what's going on, wouldn't really recommend to people who don't have at least basic knowledge of the lore, otherwise they'd end the movie in confusion but if anything watch it either way. The bad reviews shouldn't ruin a true FNAF fan's experience, worth the wait but obviously it could've been wayyyyy better and had so much potential. Looking forward to the next one.",2023-10-28
"I enjoyed this movie was was surprised by the low ratings. I know there were some plot holes though, such as -- why did the cop show up suddenly without being summoned? (I get that it was her father's place later but at the time it seemed odd). Did Mike even call the cops after the entire place was trashed? He just swept up etc. And that was it? The cop mentioned him not locking the doors at night but we saw him lock the doors the night it was trashed. I know this is nitpicking but it seemed a bit sloppy. Mary Stuart Masterson was wasted - would have loved to have seen more of her! I thought the acting was really good overall and it held my interest.",2023-10-28
"This film is more of a 6.5 to me so I struggled with what score to give it. I settled on a 7 as I felt the film was very faithful to the lore of the games, as well as delivering a fun experience for fans of the franchise. The acting was pretty good across the board with only a few iffy performances, and the atmosphere of the games was nailed perfectly. My main issues come from a lack of scares as well as some pacing issues. The film feels a bit too long with quite a few periods of inactivity, and if you are expecting this to be a security guard survival horror centric movie akin to the games, you will be disappointed. This film is more focused on its characters and their state of mind, which isn't much of a negative, but would likely be a let down if you come into this film with the expectation that it will be a jumpscare fest dripping with tension. Overall, I found the film enjoyable, but there is room for improvement and, hopefully if there is a sequel, it can delve deeper into the horror elements of the franchise.",2023-10-29
"Alright, let's just cut straight to the point. I was expecting something more gorey and scarier to be honest, but I barely saw that in the movie. It contains rarely any jumpscares and the only frightening scene was when balloon boy jumpscare.Not gonna lie, the animatronic designs are absolutley amazing and their movement and acting is very accurate. I also find the enviroment that the scenes play in are perfectly made, I love the pizzeria design! The actors were kinda good, although I felt like they missed a little of emotions. Like, when Mike saw the living animatronics playing with his sister, I think his reaction was a little eh actually. It was like that in many scenes of the movie. But some parts were also good.The storyline is.. well, uh, something I guess.? I didn't really like it, I would've appreachiated that it was more lore accurate, but...Okay, so what it was lacking was an interesting storyline, it was too little horror and they didn't even show the animatronics that much. Also not that good acting tbh.Well, it is still funny and enjoyable! I did really enjoy it. Bonus points for MatPat. Scariest jumpscare award goes to Balloon Boy. 7/10.",2023-10-30
"Full disclosure: I've never played the game, but I've seen a lot of horror movies. 🙂My teenage son wanted to see this movie and I had an evening off, so we went together. He had heard, as had I, that the reviews were bad and he wasn't hoping for more than a really good bad movie. My hope was for a 5.5-6 out of 10.We both enjoyed the show and decided the reviews were not entirely accurate.While it certainly breaks no new ground, what is presented is done passably well. We didn't find it particularly scary and while there were a few cringe-inducing moments of potentially excruciating pain, there is very little gore on screen and the horror elements, while not dissimilar to The Black Phone, are not dwelt upon in too much detail.The acting was good and the writing wasn't bad. Unless you're a horrible parent like I am, this is a pretty decent horror movie to introduce a kid to the genre. If you ARE a horrible parent, this will be pretty tame. Try The Conjuring or The Crazies. That'll get 'em.",2023-11-02
"I loved the movie, it had an interesting twist to it. The animatronics looked amazing, just like the game. The kids and adults did a good job acting, honestly, a lot of people came to the theater for the gore, but I went there just to watch a good film. And best of all, the movie is loaded with Easter eggs that reference the games, the books, etc. So don't knock a movie down or skip it because it doesn't line up with ""fan theories"" or that Mark isn't in it. Just watch it and have your own opinion. We all waited YEARS for this film, and honestly I am quite satisfied after waiting so long. Who knows, there might be a sequel in the future.",2023-10-31
"It turns out to be a film that is neither so good nor so bad, it is an entertaining film for the viewer, but quite mediocre in script.For example, the twist is mediocre and so is the resolution of the problem, I am not more explicit so as not to give you a spoiler.It's a pretty simplistic movie.And please, regarding it being a horror movie and more so being a game like fnaf,
The horror is too simplistic, what am I going with? The only thing that might scare you are their Screamers, but from there, nothing, this is in my experience but it can vary. THEY ONLY SCARED ME ONLY ONCE IN THE WHOLE MOVIE bruh, it's A horror movie please.But getting to the good point, the movie is entertaining and if you are a fan of the FNAF saga it fulfills something but it reads something about your expectations, another redeemable thing is the acting, it doesn't seem fake, and please the animatronics are never beautiful I had seen something so good, apart from light, colors, photography is beautiful in all, the aesthetic section is really good.As I mentioned, it is a movie that is neither so bad nor so good and is enjoyable if you just want to have a good time, highly recommended.",2023-10-29
"So I'll begin by saying that I've never played any of these games but I did watch someone's breakdown of the entire story line/lore a while back, so I'm sorta familiar with the concept, look and backstory of this franchise. But I must repeat, I'm not necessarily a fan really.Having said that, I went into this with not the lowest or highest expectations. The last two of these animatronic Chuck E Cheeses gone awry horror movies were absolutely horrible (Willy's wonderland and Banana Splits.) so I figured maybe third times a charm..Unfortunately this was basically on par with those. Just in a different way. This time it's obviously meant for a younger crowd and is based on a popular video game franchise. So it's basically like a big budget episode of Goosebumps, which if you're an adult sucks balls. If you're a kid maybe it's fun. But this movie wasn't really fun imo. It was boring as all hell.I've even seen fans say they that the things it did right were basically just the fact that aesthetically it look d like the game. That's a pretty surface level bar to hit if you ask me. The movie just dragged and dragged. The first hour like nothing happened. I looked at the runtime and was like god there's like another hour of this left.....",2023-11-01
When I first saw the trailer I really was starting to like this and once the movie came out and I saw it with my family it was amazing. The animatronics were splendid and seeing springtrap and others and the acting is pretty good as well even though it is pg13 it actually was good tbh and it had some pretty good jumpscares a lot of stressful parts and a lot of Easter eggs. But I really think this movie was amazing and I really want all of us to appreciate how far Scott had come to finally make this movie as his last project through the past 8 years and it finally has been completed after lots of work and I really think he did a splendid job and I think I gives this movie a solid 9/10 very well done.,2023-10-27
"I am a fan of the five nights at Freddy's games,I have been for several years. It was one of my favourite HORROR games. This movie had no horror whatsoever, it was basically the Fnaf games but made for little children. Where I live (the uk) this movie is rated a 15! It should be a 12 at highest! There's barely no gore, no violence and it's not even scary. The animatronics are even friendly! So I waited all the way till the end of the movie to see spring Bonnie, spoiler alert! He was also horrible. Nothing about him was scary and he didn't even have 5 minutes screen time. The spring Lock Scene was horrible btw(no gore).The only good thing I can say is that the animatronic costumes are pretty impressive. But other than that the movie was a complete disaster. It's a shame because I was excited for this movie.",2023-10-27
"This movie was not a disappointment. It was exactly what I expected it to be. A mild horror experience for kids. I felt comfortable letting my young son watch this as he is a big fan of the games. When I say young, i mean 5 years old. Watching him watch this was like seeing myself watching jaws as a young boy. Except far less traumatized afterwards. Is it for people who set their benchmark at the saw movies or the conjuring? Nope. I will say the plot holes or plot jumping really make you scratch your head. But it's still very cool to see the setting and animatronics come to life. I hope they make more of these films in future.",2023-10-28
"My son Henry who is nearly 13 has been playing the computers games for Five Nights at Freddy's for years, which having only briefly played the VR version myself before getting motion sickness, I gathered was the story of some children that ware kidnapped and murdered and their souls made to inhabit big robot teddy bears that are the main attraction at a defunct burger restaurant from the 1980's called 'Freddy Fasbergers'.So when they said last year or so they were bringing a movie out, my son has been so, so excited ever since, literally counting the days down until it comes out. We planned a trip away months ago so we could watch it at a big cinema with big leather reclining seats.So imagine when we found out a couple of months ago that it had been rated 15 so he wouldn't be able to see it!So me being me, and Henry being Henry..... hatched a perfect plot to get him in to see it, which we gave the name 'Operation Teddy bears picnic'.On the night of the film, I bought tickets for myself and my older son to go and see Five nights at Freddie's which was on screen 13 at 7:40pm. We had also bought a ticket for the Taylor Swift tour movie, which was showing 3 screens away down the same corridor at 7:30pm. We knew they check your tickets and check ID for age as you go through to the screens, but not at each individual screen.So, armed with his ticket, Henry went to the Taylor Swift movie and sat there quietly for 10 minutes surrounded by hundreds of little girls waving flashing LED glitter wands and running around in Disney dresses like maniacs on cocaine, arguing about whether 'Shake it off' is better than 'Bad Blood'.Myself and my other son then went through the security to the Freddy movie and sat there for 5 minutes.I then went to the toilets, where Henry was there waiting for me as had been pre arranged, and we then both went to the Freddy movie, with me stood tall hiding him as he snuck into the screen.. and it worked! Mission success! So I'm now officially the best Dad that ever lived.I think in reality, the people checking the tickets, who were teenagers themselves on minimum wage, probably wouldn't have cared in the slightest, but we couldn't take any chances.Henry spent the first half hour looking very nervous as he was worried that at any moment the screening would be stormed by a SWAT team armed with Bar Code readers, who would swoop on him and throw him out. Fortunately this never happened, and we were able to watch the movie and egress to a safe distance without any further drama.As for the movie itself, well, what can I say? It's clearly aimed at fans of the game franchise, but I've never played the games myself so many of the references and names were sadly wasted on me. But that being said, with no real prior knowledge of the movie, I watched it with an open mind. And I did find it really, really entertaining. I gather people are complaining it doesn't follow the story of the games, but as I didn't know that, I found the story they actually did tell compelling, interesting, and exciting. I could quite happily watch it again! I was fully engaged for the entire movie.The characters are good, the music and special effects are excellent, and really set a good scene for the many jump scares which I gather is the main theme of the whole Five Nights at Freddy's 'lore'.As for the rating. Well, I think 15 is too harsh. It doesn't need to be a 15. That being said, it could certainly terrify younger children, especially those who haven't played the game or who are not aware of it. There is certainly a lot of nightmare fuel in there. Huge animatronic teddy bears with glowing eyes will be populating a number of nightmares for years to come I suspect. Possibly mine.So if you have a precious sensitive child who only plays Minecraft and Minion Rush while in their 'safe space', then you may want to give this a miss.If on the other hand you have a more robust child who makes dens, digs holes, and plays by streams with a stick.. then they're going to love watching Five Nights at Freddy's. It was fantastic.",2023-10-30
"Went into this expecting some resemblance to the game but it was far from it. I don't mind when a movie takes on a completely different direction than expected whether it's based on a game, tv series or book but this wasn't as good as it could have been.They had everything; excellent directing, beautiful atmosphere, great actors, etc to work with but the plot! Why!? The whole angle with the brother being taken when he was a child and the cop with her Father story just ruined what could have been an incredible film. They should have dropped all of that and instead had him working there, noticed sounds, movement at the corner of his eye, then noticed the animatronics in different positions, investigated, saw them move, they chased him, he ran into that surveillance room and then take it from there. It was so unnecessary and bizarre to incorporate the whole backstory with the children being inside the animatronics and how they wanted to take his sister, it made it silly and a bit ridiculous.This could have been so much more entertaining and scary had they not strayed so far from the concept that made Five Nights At Freddy's so popular to play. Completely stripped it of all spookiness and turned into a watered down horror. However even despite all of that I have to give it a 7 simply because although disappointed, the film itself wasn't awful and I want to support it because if they make a sequel, I'm hoping they can turn it around.",2023-10-31
"I HOPE WE CAN GET ANOTHER MOVIE, I LOVE THIS SERIES SO MUCH. I've been waiting for this movie since I was 11 (almost 10 years ago) and I'm so happy with how it came out. It answered some questions we had and we also have new theories thanks to this movie! I seriously hope the movie does well so we can get another two! All time favorite series.I definitely recommend if you're a long time fan and/or know the lore! They did a great job making the animatronics, they look so good! And the actors were amazing at their roles. I personally loved when a certain song came on at the end (I won't say what song 😉)",2023-10-27
"Im kind of confused of why the reviews are so low?Such a great movie! A good mix for people new to the franchise and long standing fans. Maybe some of the reviews around the internet are fake. There were some pacing issues, and some scenes felt like they dragged for a bit, but I had fun with this movie. To be honest I was a little disappointed it wasnt more graphic like I expected, however I understand that the audience does consist of a lot of children. One of the best game to movie adaptations. Incredible job by the cast and crew!. There was some scenes i didn't enjoy. For example the dreams the main character had. And the way it switched from dark,mysterious and creepy vibe before he fell asleep and then from nowhere when the dream started it was so light,bright, kinda messed up the mood of the creepy vibes it had before. And the blonde girl was the most annoying character ever!",2023-10-28
"It was definitely for the fans. Yes a few bits were a little like..what. But I kinda enjoyed it. I loved the easter eggs and the scares, and the plot was actually interesting to follow and theorise.I think some scenes sorta broke up the tension and a few jokes broke it up a bit which I'd good for someone who is a little jumpy. The jumpscares do get you sometimes. But I think the calmer and funnier scenes gave you a good giggle.Me and my friends all loved it. We were really worried it'd be scary and we'd be freaking out but even her, a jumpy and freaked out person, was fine afterwards.I actually really liked it, hope the next 2 will be just as good if not better!",2023-10-27
"What a movie, This movie is not going to score well amongst critics or non fans of the story for fnaf. But if you have spent your entire child hood investigating and trying to make sense of this series of games since 2014. The movie was perfect. Instead of being what the games are (constant jump scares and horrors) the movie goes for a more creepy calm approach when telling us the story, the narrative is clear and lots of new plot points to make note of, being able to see the missing children visualized and able to be interacted with was a really emotional moment. It took us years just to confirm their names and now we see their spirits in the flesh. I was so worried about this movie ruining the story however it was incredible! The visuals and sound design were amazing, and the acting was incredible. Thank you scott and blumhouse for making our childhoods amazing. I cant wait for the next movies in the series!",2023-10-27
"I watched this movie 1 hour ago as im writing this and i am gonna say that this movie was a fun time for FNAF fans (especially me!)
The plot had some roughness but it felt like i was back home, like the original FNAF with the most confusing lore of all goddamn universe
The animatronics felt so real too and Springtrap tho... chef kiss design and i don't want to spoil it but that ending
The cast is just perfect!! I love all of the cast especially William Appleton... i mean William Afton
Take the critics opinion as a grain of salt and try enjoying this movie, you will feel like this is a good and well done movie!",2023-10-25
"This film is for FNAF fans only. If you don't know the Five Night's at Freddys lore, you'll get bored, and better for you, don't go for this. You will only ruin the experience for others.But if you know the lore, it's a great fun for you, and I guarantee you will get some more I formation to the main lore, even, if this film is not Canon, it has a lot to say.The music is great. The characters are great. The plot is awesome, and makes sens. There is not to much gore, (what were you expecting for 15+ movie?) But enough, to called it fnaf.Don't worry, there is no ""Together, we are fnaf"" or ""okay fazgang, let's spring that lock"". ;)",2023-10-27
"As a fan of the franchise from the very beginning I thought the movie was INCREDIBLE! The care and attention to detail is so impressive. Will be going to see it again in the cinema and will definitely get in on Peacock! Thankful for the film and can not stress enough that it was beautifully made, taking everything into consideration. If you love fnaf you will definitely enjoy this. I respect everyone has different options but the criticism this movie has received is pretty harsh imo. Regardless it kept me and my friends entertained through out and we loved to see the animatronics and characters coming to life!",2023-10-27
"I've never played the video games but was aware of the characters and wanted to watch based on the horror factor. Unfortunately this film fell very flat. The acting was average but Josh, Matthew and Elizabeth did the best with what they had to work with. Story had amazing potential had they decided to go with more of a horror film approach, as an avid fan of the horror genre these scenes were disappointing. More depth was needed with the storyline delving into the past and present, trying to work out what happened to Mikes brother and the children. Ok for anyone under 13 but it wasn't for me. Sorry.",2023-10-28
"It's decision to lean into to such a heavy topic like child abduction played against the silliness of the weird robots was an interesting choice. I also have to add I've never played the video game and I'm still not done watching the movie... I feel like they did a good job with it though. It's interesting and Josh Hudginson or whatever does an awesome job. I feel like he took his job seriously and really gave it his all. I'm a big fan of his now. I stand by my opinion she's too pretty to be a cop though. I'd want more for her. I'll unpack that at a later time. Thank you for sticking with me, I'm grateful for you.",2023-10-29
"I enjoyed it! It has some flaws but it was charming enough to overcome them and get a positive review at the end of the day. It had a couple of jumpscares but I found them to be tastefully done compared to a lot of modern horror films. I'm not an expert regarding the lore but it maintained the main ideas while taking us alongside a story that is surprisingly comprehensible, however it feels a little bit watered down, and a lot of the characters feel superficial.I saw this for what it is, a videogame movie with a lot of lore and a mixed bag of horror elements. It still falls and makes several clichés, so it's mostly predictable. However, it was nicely shot, characters are recognizable, their mistery feels hollow at times, or unnecesarily obtuse, but its FUN, a lot of fun. It's not the best horror film out there, it even is arguable if it is actually horror, but as a videogame movie its a really good time. I forgive a lot of these flaws because of that, and to me it's ok.The ending made sense, and the story did too, I'm satisfied. If you're a fan of the franchise, then its a no brainer, if not, then with the right mindset, it's 109 minute (1h 49m) runtime is gonna pass in no time, but from a strictly critical eye it doesn't hold up as well.",2023-10-26
"Saw this movie in the cinema the day after it came out and while there definitely were a bunch of parts I liked about it, there were were some bad things about it too. Unfortunately I think the biggest flaw of the movie is that it was primarily designed with the fans in mind which does make it a treat for those more indulged in the fnaf community, but for outsiders they would find a lot of parts of it confusing and difficult to understand which I for sure suffered with since I am not that indulged. There also were sections that didn't make sense and some parts that wasted a lot of time, like the whole plot with the aunt wanting to take the sister away which could have been easily trimmed out to save more time for fleshing out the plot. But overall it did have good effects like the whole set for the pizzeria, most of the characters are well written and the more creepy bits were well done even if I do wish there were more of them. So overall this film is good for fnaf fans but it might not be for everyone!",2023-10-26
"Five Nights at Freddy's takes us on a chilling journey through the haunted halls of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, and it's safe to say that fans of the iconic game series won't be disappointed. The film adaptation manages to capture the essence of the games while adding its own unique flair. The pacing of the film is expertly done, mirroring the tension-building gameplay of the original series. As the night guard navigates through the creepy animatronic creatures, the suspense is palpable. The jumpscares are expertly timed, providing genuine moments of fright that fans of the franchise have come to love. However, what truly elevates Five Nights at Freddy's is its use of sound and music. The end credits song, in particular, is a stroke of genius. It not only serves as a perfect accompaniment to the credits but also evokes a powerful sense of nostalgia. For fans who have followed the series from its inception, this song is a beautiful nod to the journey they've been on.",2023-10-27
"I've always enjoyed the antics of the FNAF franchise. I've only recently played FNAF 1 for the 1st time and that was definitly an experience i'll never forget. One of the most tense games i've ever played.Now when it comes to the FNAF movie, the thing I was most impressed with was the animatronics themselves. Shout out to Jim Henson's Creature Shop for making these creatures show so much life and expression. There were moments that had me forgetting they are killing machines because they look so innocent. Then there's the carnage...For a being a PG13 Horror flick, they did a pretty good job with showing the fatalities without getting too gruesome. I did feel like they were holding backing on the brutality just a little bit, but considering the games never showed that much level of brutality, I get it. There were some effective scares, some unexpected as well.Josh Hutcherson and Piper Rubio led the movie well. The brother and sister dynamic was pretty interesting. It wasn't executed perfectly, but I could buy the relationship. Elizabeth Lail, while did well with what she was given, didn't get to do a lot. Unfortunately, Matthew Lilard's character was sort of wasted in my opinion. Should've been given more.Overall, the thing that really bugged me was the narrative of the story. It's pretty convoluted at times. I also wished they'd make this movie tighter. Maybe chop up about 15 minutes of content. (My suggestion at least.)In the end, it's not bad, but it's also not good. It's somewhere in between. I'd say it's a good FNAF movie, and a bellow average movie movie. I still found enjoyment out of it though.",2023-10-29
"I went in not knowing anything about FNAF...but now I'm obsessed. It's a great horror concept, and I can now understand the craze and cult following.As far as the movie goes I thought it was excellent. That hour and fifty minutes flew by and left me wanting more. Hopefully sequels are in the works. I'm hearing rumors that they are!The performances are excellent...especially Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lillard who never seem to disappoint in any project they work on. Matthew Lillard is the stand out for me who really earned his paycheck for this movie and made the most of his couple of scenes.I think this would be a great intro horror film for young people.",2023-10-29
"Now if you been a fnaf fan since the game you'll definitely love this it delivers everything from the first game to the power being limited to the scary feeling to the music and Easter eggs it definitely delivers the only thing I really wanted was the movie to be longer but I'm glad we got the movie after 9 years of waiting I'm glad they finally thought to make it and I wish the movie does well enough to get part 2,3,4 but trust me like I said if you been a fnaf fan ever since the game came out you will 100,000% love this movie and everything it will offer but ya that's about it love you scott thank you for everything bye bye.",2023-10-27
"I thoroughly enjoyed 5 nights at Freddys. I was a bit skeptical at first. I had heard some bad reviews and some rotten tomato claims this movie wasn't fresh enough for them. I listen to how people claimed it was a rip off of Willys Wonderland and even the Banana Splits movies, but I decided to give it a watch. After all, the original Five Nights at Freddys game came out long before Willys wonderland or Banana splits--so obviously the ripping off was done by those movies--and who even reviews movies for Rotten tomatos anyway? I would decide for myself. I am glad I did, Five nights at Freddys is a fun watch--really good Halloween movie that can be viewed by the entire family because its not a torture porn flick and not terrifying to the point its too bad for most kids. I really enjoyed it, loved the atmosphere of the movie and recommend it to anyone looking for a not too wild Halloween horror treat.",2023-10-30
"This movie is for the fans not the critics, and I liked it. As a longtime fans i was blown away from finally seeing Freddy on the big screen. And it ticks all my boxes, for what i wanted to see in the first movie, and gave just the right amount of fanservice.However I also have to look at it form a general movie critics view.The pace is not perfect, and they spend a little too much time on the dream sequences. The animatronics look amazing, and I think it was a good decision to go with practical effects, Jim Henson studios did an awesome job. Clap and a half. At first when the animatronics was introduced to be good I thought to myself this will be bad, and I think the movie would have been better without it. However, I also like how the turned it around in no time, and made the dangerous when Mike refused to give up Abby. The acting was okay not bad but not perfect. And I would have liked to spend more time on the mystery of who is the yellow bunny man?But I have to stick to my first impression and say it is a fan movie, and it dividers on all fronts, 8 stars.",2023-10-30
"I don't understand why the review score is so low here. As a fan of the games, I really enjoyed this adaptation. Watching this at the cinema I felt so many amazing emotions and genuine fear watching this film and, yes, the acting isn't the best and even a bit too cheesy at times, the story sometimes doesn't make too much sense and it kind of assumes you know a bit of lore and does little to explain the backstory, however it is a really fun film, well worth watching more than once and the music is incredibly spine chilling.Seeing these video game characters I grew up with portrayed in live action genuinely excited me and the costumes and scene locations look incredible, great job to everyone who worked on the film and hopefully looking forward to a second film some time soon!",2023-10-31
"It isn't exactly like the games and it seems like the movies have made their own lore similar but different to the games, but so did the books. It was all around pretty good and the theater was very reactive and engaged with the movie. They set it up well for a sequel and I hope they make one just because I want to see what they do with this alternate plot.This was definitely a movie for the fans! While it could be a good jumping point for new people to get into the series, it is thoughtfully made for returning fans.The use of puppets and costumes were such a great idea! CGI ages poorly since we're constantly improving on it, but practical props feel more timeless.While the spin on the FNAF movie was not the take I was expecting, I think it was worth the wait just to hear the theater explode with enthusiasm whenever references would pop up.",2023-10-27
"FNAFI just watched the FNAF movie and I had a great time with it!Does that mean that it was good? EHHHH......First of all I have to clarify that I'm not into FNAF. Ik that it is about some animatronics and some killer who.... kills chidlren and now the children are the animatronics and they kill other children while pretending to be animatronics..... yeah
Also I'm not into Horror in general. But it's okay 'cause it's barely a horror movie, despite being cathegorised as a horror movieI also have to clarify that I'm not a horror guy either. I like intense movies but watching a movie about some demonic looking goblin cutting some woman in half is not my cup of tea. But it's OK 'cause except for some corpses and some intense interactions it's really scary at all. Maybe I don't really watch horror movies 'cause I don't see the point of wanting to be scared, but many scenes that were supposed to be scary were just laughable. I legit laughted during most of the ""scary"" scenes which were just lame jumpscares that you would see for some Halloween Candy commercial. But if you get easily scared may e you wil have a completely different than mine, but considering that pretty much everyone seems to agree on this I will put this as a feature not as a take.In general this movie was so weird yet so stale. Despite the movie throwing so much shir at you and also despite being a movie based on FNAF which the whole point of the proprety is that it's unnerving and scary, it was shockingly light hearted and slow paced.It's also not that much of a FNAF Movie. I got the impression that all of the ideas are figthing for who gets more attetion. A big portion of the FNAF movie has nothing to do with FNAF and it's more about this Mike guy who can relive parts of his childhood with the help or lucid dreaming or something and uses that to find out who kidnapped his brother. Or at least he tries to. The movie is also about Mike fighting to win custody of his little sister Abby and if you're wondering yeah, this is the FNAF movie, and we haven't even got to the animatronics yet.So if you're wondering how any of this connects with the game, well.... Mike gets a job at Freddy Fazbear as a security guard. Yeah thats about it, did you expect something more complex?And from there Mike discovers that this place is much weirder than he expected FNAF you know what FNAF is it's about some animatronics who are possesed...? By some little kids killed back in 1987 or some shir. I wonder why are you still hear if ypu don't even know wt a FNAF is.The biggest problem with the movie is how all over the place the plot is. Just like I said, many plot points don't really seem to gel together until... tehe climax. The movie itself is very slow. And the plot isn't even bad. But while I was interested to see what's gonna happen with these charaters, many scenes were boring. A lot of this movie is just so lacking in tension and conflict. Manty scenes is just the charaters going throught the scene and just wondering around and waiting for something interesting to happen. And one of the examples is that the movie doesn't really take advantage of the fat that it's a FNAF movie. Ik I've already said that multiple times in this review but like. Without getting into spoilers, these five nights at freddies are not even tht scary. A lot of them is just Mike and his attempt to remmeber who kidnapped his little brother. It's like imagine the Sonic Movie but Tom the Cop is the one who goes into the Sonic World and instead pf exploring this new world he is just talking with his wife on his phone. It's okay to add more stuff but the problem is the lack of balance. In the first act the movie doesn't really seem to care that Micheal is working at Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria. It was dissapointing and seeing how the third act combined these conflicts together in a very rushed manner, it really makes you think how much unused potetial this movie has. How much it had cause it's already done.And because of the awful pacing, many moments don't really make sense 'cause it's either too slow to care or too quick to bother take it's time to explain what it's even happening.Just like I said, I was hooked on Mike's internal conflict and his relationship with Abby. And while these and Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria didn't have that much of an organic connection, I still liked how step by step the movie learnt to combine multiple ideas together. But they didn't go too far. The climax was very rushed. Basically all of the set up from the rest of the movie is solved in like less than 15 minutes. Like all of these many ideas peaked into a climax that either needed to be longer or just cut some of the ideas and make it a little more straightforward. Like it waas fun but I couldn't help myself but just recognize that they could've gotten so even deeper and have a much more complex climax.But despite my harsh critising towards the script, I will admit, all of the stuff I just told you was actually kinda fun. Yeah, there are scenes who are just boring, but there others who are unironically interestijg. The characters where actually decent. Mike had enough of a personality to make me root for him, Abby was cute, Vanessa was likeable and the @nimatronics themselves are fascinating/interesting. I would like to talk about the main villain but I want to avoid spoilers and he is barely in the film, just like I said the clima was rushed. The acting, while not great, was competent, and the charisma of the actors added to the fun of the movie. The @nimatronics themselves are really well done with the help of practical effects and Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria as a location is a sweet looking place, having the duality of being this child friendly pizzeria but also this sinister discomposed place full of mistery and fright. From the colorful main stage to the dirty security room and the dark hallways made the experience feel complete. The Soundtrack of the film, the licensed songs being appropiate and also original score being memorable.The editing and the cinematograhpy are very impressive. The colors are appropiate to the highstakes yet over the top story, and there are some sweet shots especially at Freddy's. Overall all the respect for the direction departament.And yeah that's about it. It's a mixed bag, filled with both lackluster writing and fun direction. I will give FNAF a 6/10 go watch it, there is a lady cut in half in the morning.",2023-11-02
"As someone who played the games and read the books, I was extremely impressed at how fun this movie was to watch! Many elements from all the games molded to a simplistic storyline with familiar characters that anyone watching can enjoy despite their knowledge of the series.The ending revelation of not obsessing on the past to focus on the important parts of the present is a powerful one and something many can relate to. I know I did.The animatronics were amazing and almost surreal with how perfect they were! Jim Henson's Creature Shop completely (and almost eerily) created perfect replicas of the characters.On to the bad...MatPat - the dorky waiter and YouTuber who makes repetitive videos of FNAF lore - ruined the movie for me twice so I feel the need to roast him for it.The first time was being in the movie - it wasn't needed at all and completely ruined the emersion. ""It's just a theory!"" I was legitimately mad about this scene.Second is that he completely spoiled the entire movie on his YouTube channel! I don't know how YouTube even recommended his video to me when I explicitly told them to ""never recommend"". Still, I watched his video anyway to give him a chance because I was excited about the movie.He stated ""William Afton is Matthew Liliard's character!"" and that stuck with me while watching. So, when the big revel came I was just angry again.Sorry to any fans of his who read this, but you can't say I'm wrong with my annoyances.Now that I got the negatives off my chest, Scott created such a powerful series and I'm so glad the movie held up great even on its own. I have to admit this is the best movie I've seen in a really long time. Well done, Mr. Cawthon!",2023-10-29
"I'm a long term fnaf fan, and a long term fan of Scott's work, and when this movie was announced I was so excited and restless to see what happens. At first I was really hoping it wasn't going to be a cringey video game adaptation. But man was I impressed. I was sitting in the theater and it starts with basically Mikes basic life. Him getting fired, then being offered to work at Freddy's. Then we get like this whole like view into mikes struggle to keep custody of his sister. And then we get a Matpat appearance. I was truly shocked in the theaters I couldn't resist the feeling to lean over to my brother and say, ""it's MatPat!""
And then fast forward to the end, we find out the Vanessa is William Aftons daughter and then we get a spring lock scene. This movie had jumpscares scattered around it and some were like a funny jump scare and also, this movies Easter eggs that were put throughout. Sparky, Cory, etc. Made the movie feel like the game. I just loved this film, I already want a second one.",2023-10-29
"It is definitely a retelling of the game series. My wife and I had watched several Youtubers play the games years ago when the game first came out. Never knew until a few months ago that there was a movie in the works.It is an enjoyable movie, not really suitable for kids, especially with watching someone get bitten in half, with their waist and legs falling to the floor (it was dark and you don't see much), but still a decent movie. Only recognized one YouTube personality in the movie, Mat Pat, and not the other guy who was the cab driver. Was disappointed to see that Mark had a scheduling conflicts during the filming of this movie, maybe he'll make a cameo if there's a sequel/prequel movie.",2023-10-29
"Lots of fun easter eggs and fan service, in a sense, for the fans of the games, plot leaves a fair bit to be desired but is still satisfying and a good watch for the audience. A lot of background characters felt unimportant due to lack of screen time, character development etc. Similar to the games in a lot of ways but has quite a few changes still that in some ways contribute to it and in other ways harm it. Mike and Abby were a bit awkward at times but had an overall nice story and solid arc, though it would have been nice to see their relationship's development more clearly. Animatronics looked good and their screen time was mostly well done, the way they handled them going from happy to not happy or just generally changing emotions was overall a bit confusing but still worked. Overall solid and well done for a video game movie.",2023-10-28
"This movie works perfectly as a starter horror movie, an adaptation of a beloved video game, the beginning of a franchise, an introduction for newcomers, a love-letter to the fans. Similar to the Haunted Mansion movie, I don't know what more people were expecting based on the concept and trailer. As a fan it is incredible to finally see this movie after 8 years. It could have been all sorts of awful but the decision to let fans make this was what truly sold it. I don't know if Universal fully understood what they had on their hands before the trailer dropped but if I don't walk through a FNAF Halloween Horror Nights Maze next year, I'll be shocked.Also watch YT/ThruTheTurnStyles.",2023-10-27
"This movie was not what I was originally wanting it to be, but I still had fun watching it. I can see why they made it the way they did. It makes it pretty impossible to compare it to Willy's Wonderland, as it is almost the exact opposite.In Willy's Wonderland, Nic Cage doesn't speak at all and you get no backstory to him. In Five Nights, most of the movie is backstory and character building.In Willy's Wonderland, most of the movie is blood and murder. In Five Nights, all the kills are off screen and the kill count is pretty low.While I personally enjoyed Willy's Wonderland more, I still had fun with this. It was light, and easy to watch. There were scenes in it that I very much enjoyed, and I could see this as a good intro to horror movies for the younger generation. The puppetry and animatronics were absolutely amazing and it is great to see practical effects with The Jim Henson Company bringing the creatures to life. The puppeteer work is what really made this movie.Overall, it was a lot of fun, but not really the kill fest and all-out animatronic blood bath that I was kind of expecting... until I found out it was PG-13. This is a great gateway horror for people just getting into the genre. But watch Willy's Wonderland if you are looking for something more bonkers and vicious.",2023-10-29
"Personally i enjoyed it ! People are way too critical and had way too high expectations. It was exciting, thrilling and a bit fluffy. What you expect from any other movie. It was enjoyable for both fans and those who Arent familiar with the franchise. The animatronics looks amazing also! Would definitely recommend!Im really hoping for a second one tbh, and think blumhouse did an amazing job getting around the characters and small funny references for fans. I was excited and also surprised about the plot feeling it wasnt fully predictable even though being deep into plot and theories. Not my favourite movie of all time, but differently one i wouldnt mind watching again in the future. Thank you blumhouse for a fun evening<3.",2023-10-27
"I really enjoyed my time with this movie, but man does it have flaws.I'm not as much of a FNAF fan as I used to be, but I can see how if you are a die hard FNAF fan you will adore this movie. The experience in the theater was better than the movie itself to be honest.Firstly, the writing. It's not great, but it's not terrible. The pacing at the beginning feels a little quick, and the movie wraps up way too fast. The movie does not resolve everything at the end and leads to some plotholes. (I won't explain because this is a no spoilers review)The overall plot is fine enough, but the scares are practically nonexistent. I didn't jump at any of the ""scares"" this movie has to offer. The jokes aren't that great either, the only time I genuinely laughed was at one of the kills. It looks really goofy, and you will know what I am talking about once you see it.By the way, there are no actual jumpscares from the animatronics. Which was a little disappointing to say the least. Also all of the kills suck, maybe except for the last one. I honestly think the movie was a bit held back in the kill department due to the PG-13 rating.Another thing I want to mention is that the score was strangely excellent, I wasn't expecting the score to be amazing. The animatronics look great as well, and so does the pizzeria.The only scene that I really didn't like is this weird scene in the middle with a random pop song that really kills the pacing and tone. It felt really forced. The movie also takes itself way too seriously, I know I didn't take it seriously one bit. I can totally understand why some people really don't like this movie, it's a bit of a mess and overhyped.It's a bit messy as it is but I enjoyed my time overall. If you're not a huge FNAF fan, I wouldn't recommend it. If you are a huge fan of FNAF you'll have a blast. Definitely go see the movie with friends.See you at the second movie.",2023-10-27
"The highly anticipated Five Nights at Freddy's movie has finally arrived, bringing the beloved indie horror game to the big screen. In this detailed review, we'll explore why this adaptation deserves 8 stars for its unique take on the source material and its ability to send shivers down your spine.1. Faithful Adaptation (8/10):
The FNAF movie impressively captures the eerie ambiance and animatronic horrors of the game. The pizzeria feels just as menacing on screen as it does in the game, with a dark, claustrophobic atmosphere that's true to its source material.2. Storytelling (8/10):
The film introduces a new night guard, played by a solid cast, who must survive a series of terrifying nights at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. While it introduces some new elements to expand on the lore, it respects the core storyline of the game and keeps fans engaged with its captivating narrative.3. Character Development (7/10):
Given the movie's focus on suspense and horror, character development is somewhat limited. However, it does provide enough depth to the main characters to make you care about their fates, creating a connection that adds to the tension.4. Horror Elements (9/10):
The FNAF movie excels in delivering genuine scares. The animatronics are as creepy as ever, and their movements are more terrifying when brought to life on screen. The jump scares are well-timed, and the tension is palpable throughout, making it a pulse-pounding experience.5. Visual Effects (8/10):
The movie's visual effects bring the animatronics to life in a genuinely unsettling way. The use of practical effects and animatronics, combined with CGI, adds to the authenticity of the creatures, making them a highlight of the film.6. Cinematography (8/10):
The cinematography effectively uses lighting and camera angles to build suspense and amplify the horror. It cleverly utilizes the limited visibility of the security cameras, mirroring the game's sense of dread.7. Soundtrack (8/10):
The movie's soundtrack plays a crucial role in enhancing the horror experience. It incorporates eerie, discordant music that complements the atmosphere and keeps you on edge. The sound design, including the animatronics' noises, is impeccable.8. Fan Service (9/10):
The FNAF movie is filled with nods and references to the game, providing fans with a delightful sense of nostalgia. These elements don't feel forced but instead add depth to the overall experience, making it clear that the filmmakers have deep respect for the source material.Conclusion:
The Five Nights at Freddy's movie successfully translates the game's dread-filled atmosphere and animatronic horrors to the big screen. It pays homage to its source material while introducing enough new elements to keep the narrative fresh and engaging. With its well-executed horror, stunning visuals, and effective sound design, it's a must-watch for both fans of the game and horror enthusiasts. While character development could be stronger, the film's ability to terrify and immerse the audience in the world of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza deserves a solid 8-star rating.IM going to kill myself if there is no sequel. Together we are fnaf.",2023-10-28
I have never played any of the five nights at Freddy's games before so my interest for this movie wasn't that high but once the trailers started coming out I was fully invested in all the hype. Now that I've seen the film I'm down to the level I was before the first trailer. It's not that the movie was bad but it wasn't necessarily good either. Credit where credit is due though the animatronics themselves looked amazing but other than that nothing else really memorable happened. Some of the kills are fine but the PG-13 rating definitely holds them back. I somewhat cared about the main story but when the big reveal happens I wasn't really that surprised. Matthew lillerd does give a good performance he's just not in the movie enough.,2023-10-28
"I enjoyed the film. There were several easter eggs throughout the movie that FNAF fans will love!I believe the core audience, the people who will love and appreciate this movie the most, are the diehard fans who have played the games, read the books, and know the lore.I think most of the criticism for this movie comes from those who aren't as familiar with FNAF. Fans are familiar with the characters, their back stories, and other details that make Five Nights at Freddy's what it is. The critics who watch the movie simply to review it, those who haven't had much interaction with the FNAF franchise, might not pick up on all of the hidden details throughout this movie.I think Scott Cawthon, the actors and everyone involved in creating this movie did an awesome job making FNAF come alive!",2023-10-28
"I've had some time to let my thoughts settle, and as a dedicated FNAF fan, my feelings about the film are mixed. While it's not a cinematic masterpiece by any means, there are aspects I enjoyed, especially in the later parts of the movie. However, the film falls short in terms of story explanation and the chosen narrative, which feels somewhat bare-bones, with the dream theory aspect being somewhat underwhelming. I had expected more screen time for William Afton, a key character in the FNAF lore. On the positive side, the set design was impressive, and it managed to keep my interest throughout the film. Some criticism has been directed at a particular ""fort"" scene, but I found it enjoyable and surprisingly not diminishing the horror of the animatronics. The film underwent numerous script iterations and director changes, leaving us wondering what could have been. With the movie's box office success, a sequel seems likely. The movie's early scenes, especially those set in the school, felt off, and the scene featuring Vanessa talking to Mike on the grassy hill was somewhat lackluster. However, I appreciated the distinct personalities given to the animatronic characters. In conclusion, while the FNAF movie has its flaws, it doesn't deserve some of the extremely harsh criticisms it has received. I'd rate it an 8 out of 10, as there are certainly aspects I didn't like, but there are also many elements that I enjoyed. Whether you're a die-hard FNAF fan or just looking for some spooky fun, it's worth giving this movie a watch.",2023-11-01
"This movie is very good! While there was some scenes I wish lasted a little longer or had been elaborated on a bit more, it was overall very fun. Its story is different from the games, as its telling its own story. If you are a fan of the games there is a high chance you are going to like it! My dad who has never played or watched the games and doesn't know any of the lore *loved* it.By no means is it perfect, it has its flaws much like the games but, for a movie with a 25 million budget, it was damn good. Other than the little things, I have no major complaints!So... GO WATCH IT FOR YOURSELF!",2023-10-28
"I never played the game and don't even know about the history, but I couldn't help enjoying it. Well acted, well directed, and looks really good. Lighthearted yet also kind of horror thriller fun. Bring back those kinds of movies where the keywords 'GOOD TIME at THE MOVIE!'Also, the re-watchability factor is through the roof!I'm almost about to go play the games now, or even better, make a sequel and take my money. The second half is also tense and enjoyable enough to keep you in your seat. Characters are well presented, and the motives are clear and heartening.I mean, I saw Killer of the Flower Moon and FNAF this week, and I will rewatch Five Night's at Freddy's anytime.",2023-10-29
"Brilliant. I DIDNT expect much of this film and expected to be disappointed but after watching it I am amazed. Great for fans of the games and original story like me. A few points in the film, I began to get worried as to where the plot was going but it was resolved. The story in the film is quite different to the original story and consists of parts from all the games but still great. And as fans like me wanted, it does include the spring-lock scene, not quite as it is meant to be but just has its own little twist on it. Also includes memorable, great, original FNaF song. Highly recommend the film for long-term fans.",2023-10-27
"I very much enjoyed this, much against my expectations. I took my 12-year-old son to it as he's a big Five Nights at Freddy's fan, am grateful that the horror aspects were pitched to a level where I could take him, it's made well for its target audience. He was comfortably scared but not terrified. There's a place for this kind of movie. I wouldn't have taken my young son to see Ichi the Killer, for example.What engaged me as a parent was the narrative of the Matt character fighting to keep his sister. A lot of the reviews have focussed on it being slow, but I didn't find it slow, I thought it well-paced in providing a solid and credible grounding for the world, in a way that anchors what would otherwise be a rather silly concept. The real-world horrors visited upon Mike and his family get metaphorical expression through the ghosts in the creepy abandoned pizza parlour, and I would not have been interested in the one without the other. Excellent performances from all the participants, particularly Josh Hutcherson, Matthew Lillard, Mary Stuart Masterson and the hilarious lawyer guy. Devastated to find the Voice of Shaggy playing such a horrible guy though!It's not perfect - the revelations seem pulled out of thin air. How does the hero suddenly know that it's ghost kids' spirits the animatronics? Plus what did Vanessa's father really want and shouldn't Matt's brother be one of the ghost kids, or did he just get murdered separately for reasons completely unconnected with anything? Doesn't matter, it's a well-made film, there's a lot of attention to detail in the direction, I think Scott Cawthon should be pretty satisfied with what they made of his franchise. I came out satisfied.",2023-10-30
"I went into this movie with some friends WANTING it to be bad, I thought it would be funny. However, I can't deny a decent movie when I see one, and this is one of them. The performances were good, no one was cheesy or overacting in anyway, and Josh Hutcherson did a solid Job as the lead in this movie.The movie wasn't as scary as I thought it was going to be, it was more intense than scary. Sure, there are a couple of jumps cares here and there, but they're pretty predictable. I'm assuming it's because they were going for a more kid friendly vibe. But, other than that little gripe, the movie was pretty good. Solid plot, kinda a don't think about it too much one where it's just meant to be fun. I'd say this is a good Halloween watch that the whole family can enjoy, but just be careful with the LITTLE ones, I'd say probably kids around 10 can handle it.",2023-10-28
"As I was reading thriugh some reviews I noticed a lot of ""adults"" that call this movie overall trash seems to have no solid evidence as to why, this movie definitely falls underneath the sentimental part of the fnaf fandom. I do however feel the movie lacked some of the main lore parts that fans seems to love overvthe course of the games. BUT as a huge fan of the franchise and Scott cartoon I let this slide and did enjoy the small tweaks and overall performance. Not once did I hate how the story played out. In fact I enjoyed how everything was portrayed and explained. The cast did an amazing performance! Mathew Liliards performance was pure chills for me!",2023-10-28
"This is a movie that is for the fans. If you see passed the references and the callbacks, you see a hardly scary film with very questionable writing at about an hour in the film. A movie adapted from a game series known for it's jump scares, hardly has any at all. From what I remember, there is only 2 total. This movie is best when it tries to be scary, when it tries to build tension, it doesn't always land but there are parts where it works well. The acting is also incredible, Josh Hutcherson was a great pick and he did a great job, especially with his characters unique concept with his dream scenarios, I don't want to spoil anything so that's all I'll say about that. I also want to briefly mention Mathew Lillard, he is a great actor who is underused, but was great in every scene he was in. The animatronics also have never looked better, they did a great job with the animatronics in this film, they felt threatening when the scene makes them threatening. It wasn't an amazing film but I was surprised because I expected it to be awful, But the problem with that is, I'm partial. I like the lore of FNaF, it's really good and very interesting, it was made with passion, because of that I enjoyed the film. They did deviate the lore alot though, but it was still a fun film for me. If you don't like the lore or don't know it, then you wont like this film at all I imagine, Look no further than the critic reviews. There was even a fight in a UK theater over this fact, which was dubbed ""The Fight of 87"". Someone said out loud that the film was awful, so a fan went over and beat him up for it. I just wanted to mention that because this film is not for everyone, if you're a fan you will at most like and enjoy the film, if you aren't a fan, you will not like it. Maybe with the dream scenarios with Mike will make non-fans at least check out the lore of FnaF, but seeing this first will not win you over.",2023-10-28
"Surprisingly good. Though it's a tad slow here and there, it has-excellent cinematography-SUPERB practical effects-a layered plot which ties in to the lore (I assume as I went to the theater without ever having played FNAF)-a very good, believable cast-a clever balance of themes: it doesn't fall into a lazy repetition of scares and its plot ingeniously follows the title, taking place during five nightsIts immense success is well-deserved, the word of mouth is excellent because it delivers and it is yet another example that critics have self-destructed and become irrelevant. I look forward to the sequels.",2023-10-29
"Is more like a fantastic drama but the story is quite good. There's not much blood cause is a very family friendly movie, but it has a lot of references and easter eggs to the franchise. Ironically FNAF doesnt have so many jumpscares like other actual ""horror"" movies.The main series consists of nine video games taking place in locations connected to a fictional family pizza restaurant franchise named ""Freddy Fazbear's Pizza"", after its mascot, the animatronic bear Freddy Fazbear. In most games, the player assumes the role of a night-time employee, who must utilize tools such as security cameras, lights, doors, and vents to defend themselves against animatronic characters who inhabit the locations and become mobile and hostile at night. The series' lore is gradually revealed through voice recordings, minigames, and Easter eggs featured throughout the games.",2023-10-26
"This movie was so well made. I love the idea of how its different than the lore we get in the games. Instead of Mike being William's son, it's Vanessa. Instead of Elizabeth, it's Abby. I love how the movie led us to a different world view.I also love how Mike's family is supposed to reflect the Afton family. The way people are pictured in the move match the people in the lore to a tea in my opinion. When watching the movie, it felt like I was reading the books at the same time.The way the movie showed the kids in Mike's dreams were such a beautiful way of showing the connection. And the Balloon Boy through the whole movie was funny as hell. Even the end after the credits.Now, the thing with Garrett being one of the victims doesn't sit right with me because wouldn't it make more sense for some else to kidnap Garrett and then find his body as a part of the epilogue. I feel like this would have given Mike more passion in the end of the movie.The acting with the missing kids was beautiful to see though. The way they would transition between ghost, to kids, to animatronics so smoothly, it was such a good way of showing the different personalities of how they work with it. It showed great connections and changing styles.This is has to be one of Scott Clawthorne's greatest projects ever.",2023-10-28
"Honestly I loved it, as a fan since 2014 this movie was very interesting for the most part and followed similar plots from the game lore, I also feel like the use of Mathew lillard was a great choice for ""Steve ragling"" and Josh hutcherson's performance was pretty good, now through all of these good things there are still some parts that weren't really fitting in and just didn't work all that well, some of the jumpscares didn't land, the plot felt a bit slow for me at times and the story had tiny little additions that weren't very interesting, now all that aside I feel like this is just a love letter to the fans and I got a great feeling that this movie is going to do very well and a sequel is very likely.",2023-10-27
"This movie is for the fans, as evidenced by the young cosplayers in the theater chortling and reveling in what they were seeing brought to cinematic life. I have a kid that plays the games, watched the YouTube people playing the games, learned the lore and got delight from the easter eggs dropped through the movie that anyone else would miss. Now if you're judging this as a movie that stands on its own you're not going to get it, so I don't think it's fair to do that when it's part of a specific cult-like context. It doesn't have the material of a Marvel universe to build on and yet it works with the absurd premise of the games pretty well in terms of building a story that exists in the service of bringing its own universe to life. If you know those games I think you're going to be very entertained and happy with what they've done with the franchise. I for one thought the Henson puppeteers did an Oscar-worthy job with the animatronics, they are 100% spot-on according to my kid, and that's saying something. Here's to the kickoff of what will likely be a trilogy, according to my kid, well done.",2023-10-28
"Without spoiling anything this absolute piece of trash needs to be burned, and then rebooted right away. Contrary to what Scott has said... This does not follow any of the well established lore from the games & books franchises. It literally throws everything out the window, and spits in your face. Any person defending this garbage has clearly never played the games nor has read the books. It barely passes as a lifetime original movie... meaning as far as movies go it is less than decent. As far as the fans are concerned this landfill is even worse than that. F- for effort that's for sure. Not only that, but I have my doubts that Scott was even involved. This seemed like MatPat (whom Scott has said he hates, and yet for some reason put an obligatory MatPat cameo in this) had more involvement with the film instead of Scott. It's literally just based on MatPat's crack pipe dreams, and nothing connects it to Five Nights At Freddy's other than the name of the film. Somehow the Banana Splits film passes more like a FNAF film than this. I know that 95% of Jason Blum's films go in the red financially, and are considered rotten... But this takes his garbage to a whole other level. If I could give it 0 stars I would.",2023-10-27
"I JUST SAW THE FNAF MOVIE (non spoiler lite review) if you aren't familiar with the franchise and basic lore, you won't like the movie. But if you are, and you were waiting 6+ years like I did, you will LOVE it. It was not as scary as I thought. But more gore then I expected in one scene. Some parts fell rushed but it's not that bad. The animations looked SO GOOD. The CGI was alright. The atmosphere was AMAZING. Story was good. The scary bits were nicely done. It is worth the watch if like I said, your a fan and know the lore and were waiting forever for it. 8.5/10. I have to put more characters before I can post the review so here.",2023-10-28
"Not sure what people were expecting for a story, but I was watching Ahsoka, and I can tell you FNAF beats every episode of that. It's not an intricate plot, but it's exactly like most action or horror type films. So, I really dont know what people were expecting. It was fun to watch, it was made with love for the fans which is extremely good to see. I have never played any of the games, and I loved it. The acting was heart felt, the atmosphere suspencerful, and acting from the leads very competent. I recommend it highly. Its easily the best plot of any movie out right now, which isn't saying a lot, but non the less truth.",2023-10-30
"First film in a while when i've left the theatre and felt that i'd been fleeced out of my money by buying at ticket.Following the utter masterpiece that was Five Nights at Freddy's, the audience burst out with a deserved round of applause; the story was the most bland thing been forced to sit in front of and observe. The acting was horrendous, to consider this a horror film would probably be right considering most of the saturated horror genre is full of films of this calibre. However, is there even enough horror to consider this a horror? I don't understand how Scott Cawthon would allow a story he's crafted through different media to be portrayed to the masses as this abomination.",2023-10-26
"This movie made me so genuinely happy. The characters, the music, the references. The story was a beautiful merge of the first three games and as a fan i absolutely adored it. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and the energy in the room was amazing. Definitely do not rely on critics, they're too harsh i believe. See it for yourself. I admit the pacing was a bit strange but nonetheless i adored it and just had so much love and passion for the characters and story. Of course small adjustments could've been made and some characters could've had more screen time, and the ending was a little rushed but still, it just made me so incredibly happy. A beautiful tribute to the franchise.",2023-10-28
"This was a good movie. It had some humor, some gruesome scenes, and some disturbing scenes. It had the horror that the Five Nights at Freddy's game usually had, but it is nothing on how the game is actually played. In the game, you are stuck in a office, and have to make sure the animatronics don't enter through the doors by watching them over a camera. This movie doesn't follow that, and goes a completely different direction. I don't understand why the critics rated it so badly, as it was an enjoyable movie with some jumpscares. For a PG-13 horror movie, it had some violent scenes that could've earned it an R rating, but overall, it was a fun movie to watch and I will be watching it again when it comes out on demand.",2023-10-30
"I'm puzzled by the reviews with this one because what are you expecting from a teen horror game movie adaption exactly? This went above and beyond what I could've possibly hoped for. I also can't help but think almost all of these reviews are by people who sat at home and viewed it through peacock on a less than ideal movie watching setup. In the Dolby Theater, this movie had such an undeniable atmosphere and presence. When the animatronics walked the entire theater shook. This experience I will admit was probably essential to the movies effectiveness. No, the story wasn't profound or life changing. Parts of the acting and story were cheesy, sure. The visuals, sets and animatronics, sound design and other elements were magnificently done. There were parts that dragged on, but overall the pacing was not bad and the intense scenes were exhilarating and rewarding. Pretty amazing how so many people can have little to no appreciation for the beautiful aesthetic and setting this movie pulled off. If you were expecting some mind boggling emotional masterpiece, maybe don't bother watching a children's horror video game movie adaption next time. Stick to old Tom Hanks movies and let the rest of us enjoy this fun, original and stimulating film!",2023-10-31
"I get it, it's extremely difficult to create a movie based on a GAME. It was made so well though. The directors specifically said that the movie was made for the fans, so you won't like it if you don't know anything about fnaf beforehand.The movie was amazing however, I have been a fnaf fan for about 8 years and I was so excited for this movie. Sure, it wasn't quite what I was expecting but it sure as hell wasn't bad!! I really love that Scott was able to do this for us and I can't wait for the other 2 movies. The movie contained so many references to the books and the games about fnaf, it was amazing. I absolutely loved this movie, although it could've been more focused on fnaf itself.For one, Max and the others breaking in to the restaurant sure gave the opportunity on gore and whatnot, but there was too much unnecessary backstory in my opinion. I wouldn't classify this movie as a horror film, but maybe more of a thriller.I do still recommend this movie to everyone, even people who aren't that big fnaf fans! The ambience was great and the soundtrack was AMAZING!",2023-10-28
I LOVED THE MOVIE SO MUCH AND I HOPE IT GETS I OTHER FILM! I LIKED THE SPRING LOCK PART OF IT TOO!! I LOVE HOW THE DEAD KIDS CAN BECAUSE GHOSTS AND TILL BE animatronics AT SAME TIME! PLEASE MAKE A OTHER ONE! I LOVE THE DEAD CHILDREN WANT ABBY TO BE MAKE THEM BUT AT END ABBY MADE IT OUT I WENT TO SCHOOL AND I HOPE THE FUNTIMES BE THE NEXT MOVIE! I LIKE ALL THE MAIN CHARA CTERS. AND I LIKE HOW THE DEAD CHILDREN FORGOT WHO KILLED THEM ON TILL ABBY DRAWED A PIC AND PUT IT UP ON THE WALL SHOWING THEM PURPLE GUY IN SPRING BONNIE SUIT KILLED THEM AND THEY GOT HIM BACK JUST WATCHING HIM DIE IN THE SPRING BONNIE SUIT WEN THE SPRING-LOCKS WEN TOFF!,2023-10-27
"When they said it was made for the fans it really was. As a fnaf fan since 2015 this movie was awesome because of the time spent with the animatronics and in the pizzeria. It is not overly scary, but it provides a good storyline that fans will easily get into. There are also plenty of Easter eggs for fans to catch as well.The cast did amazing and really helped to flesh out their characters within the story so the movie was interesting when the animatronics were not on screen. But when they were it was amazing to see them all in action. While by no means perfect, any fnaf fan will enjoy this movie and I strongly recommend that all fans should see it.",2023-10-27
Good movie. The story line was interesting. I really liked the twists and the short length of the movie. The acting was good and the color scheme was son point. It's wasn't really scary but it was PG-13 so ai wasn't expecting it to be scary. I was a little worried it was going to be repetitive and boring over an 5 night period but the creators found a way to change it up and bring some originality to it. It was cool seeing Josh Hutcherson in a scary movie like this he did a great job and I would love to see him take on more horror movie projects. Overall good movie and definitely worth a watch!,2023-10-28
"You can tell that this movie was a labour of love. Acting and production values are excellent. The story is pretty simplistic with my only complaint being a hand-wavy moment at the end to explain why the motivations of some characters are contrary to what you'd expect of them. I like that the body horror/gore is understated. Enough to be horrifying, not so much as to be traumatising or nauseating,As a movie for fans of the games - it's great. And as a fan, I rate it 9/10. As a stand-alone production, it's decent. Maybe 6/10, being let down by the simplistic narrative and muddled/illogical explanation for the motivations as mentioned above,",2023-10-27
"This is now one of my favourite movies of all time. I love this movie it is so good. The way everything was in the movie was just perfect. Everything perfect. I don't remember any other movie that has been this good recently. It's just so amazing, that after eight years of waiting, we finally get the movie we want. I expected this to be maybe a little bad, but no. When I watched it, my mind was completely blown away of how good it is. The movie was so good, I'm thinking about watching it again. It's just so amazing! I suggest everyone who are about to watch this movie, to bring a friend or something because it's just so amazing.",2023-10-27
"After years of script changes, director changes, and even studio changes, Freddy, Chica, Foxy, and Bonnie, have made their way to the silver screen. The film brings to life the setting and characters of the 2014 game (as well as its first two sequels) with such striking beauty, thanks to the immaculate work of the Jim Henson Creature Shop that you can't help but both love and fear these hulking creatures. The story will not make much sense if you're not a fan of the games, and neither will most of the details in the background of so many shots. That's the real issue this movie has. However, from a visual perspective, Director, Emma Tammi delivers something truly breathtaking in the world of the pizzeria. The sets, costumes, sound design, and camera work are all beautifully executed and are never bogged down by the complex yet somewhat structurally thin story, but if you're a fan of the games, then you'd know that's just how this franchise is.For newer fans or casual audiences, I would recommend this only after indulging in some of the online content surrounding the franchise, whether that be Markiplier's playthroughs or the countless Game Theory videos on the subject. But for long-time fans of the franchise, this brings to life the first game with elements of the sequels spread throughout in a way that sets it in a special part of the Fazbear universe.",2023-10-27
"I have some familiarity with the FNAF franchise. I have kids at the right age to be into it. I even read a few creepypasta stories about the characters because as a whole, it's an interesting concept. All of the stories pretty much ended the same way - main character/narrator ends up stuffed into an animatronic suit - Not quite what happens here (the guy in the suit at the end isn't exactly a main character)Movie as a whole wasn't terrible. The kids - 13 and 17 respectively - liked it. I liked it. Although the ending was super predictable, the trip to get there was decent. The dialogue felt clunky at times as well as expositional as hell, occasionally boring. But again, decent enough if you watch as a fan.The (non-human) characters themselves look like they're pulled straight from the games and that's great. True to the source. Impressive work on the puppetry.Overall it was decent, but not even close to what the hype and expectations were leading to. I liked it enough, but probably won't go out of my way to see it again.",2023-10-27
"I believe many people were expecting a horror instead of a thriller but I don't think that would have been good at all as this goes into the lore and backstory of FNAF. I believe if they make new ones, which they will, it'll become into a horror as they've told much of the lore already. If they add Nightmare versions of the animatronics (FNAF 4) that'd be good too as it would show more. I would watch this again 100%, Just don't expect to be scared so much as it may be becoming a trilogy and there's a lot of lore to go throughOverall, it was a great movie and I can't wait for the others to be made.",2023-10-27
The fnaf movie is honestly Visually and Fun to watch. The animatronic designs are really good and move like robots. The jump scares were really solid for it to be in film. The mood is great too! It makes me just wanna watch it again since it's a movie I remember so much! Highly recommend it! I know this is just a silly review but I'm being honest and plus other reviews are better than mine. Compared to most horror films nowadays this one has to be one of the most fun ones. Not a masterpiece but a great watch and I can't wait for what Blumhouse has in store for the upcoming years! Keep doing what you're doing Blumhouse!,2023-10-31
"Loved every moment of this movie! It's loaded with Easter eggs and OG lore from the games to the point that not only can you tell the creator was a part of the writing team, but you can also tell everyone else on the project were actual fans of the games (or at least liked the idea). I'll admit it's not super scary, especially compared to how the games were when they first came out, but as far as video game adaptations go it was faithful to the source material with some changes that didn't make it feel like a story ripped off from the original. Definitely support this, I want to see a sequel!!",2023-10-28
The only ones who hated it wanted the game to be exactly like the movie and which is why its hated right now they set there expectations to high when in reality thats not how adaption works. I love the start of the movie to the end the animatronics were made perfectly and the golden freddy scene was one of my favorites couldn't have asked for a better movie for the game i been playing since the first game. I really hope they make another movie it would make my life i need to complete all the games i have the vr one and a few of the original ones on my phone but i want them on my pc too. Great movie!,2023-10-28
The movie is funny to me. Chika was so creepy in the dark. Bonnie was a psycho. Foxy was fast and violent. Freddy was a human killing machine. It was a classic scary movie. The deaths of the humans are going to be so brutal. I was having so much fun watch the trailer. The whole survival is a insean they will have survive in Freddy's pizza with 5 animatronics. It will have a lot of jump scares that will scare me away. You all ready know I am watch this movie with a lot of refrnens of the classic video games. This will be the first time watching a scary movie in the movie house. This is going to be crazy.,2023-10-26
"I honestly dont know what some people are complaining about because this is literally amazing from the designs of the set and animatronics, to the actors/actresses talent is amazing and on point. Love the references and small details throughout the whole movie. The story was gripping and made sense for the main character. I would definitely rewatch this many times and I really hope they continue this franchise in a series of movies showcasing every game. Plus to add on I like how the creators did their research all the way to even involving the comics. I shall also add on that there is some comedic moments that just livens up and gives it life.",2023-10-28
"My partner and I watched this because we love the video game series. Ultimately, WE LOVED IT. There was a lot of references to the lore, and overall kept us on the edge of our seats. This was a fantastic movie and I would love to see a second one. I hope to see the rest of the characters at some point, too. I wouldn't recommend this as a ""family movie"" but I still think young adults and people who enjoy FNAF should watch this. Aside from the few jump scares throughout (I am not a guy who cares for spooky movies) I consider this to be more of a thriller rather than ""scary"" or ""horror"" which is nice. Overall, I recommend especially if you enjoy the franchise.",2023-10-28
"I loved this movie so much! This movie was meant for the fans, which is probably why not so much people like it, but as a fan, this is my favorite movie of 2023! There are great scenes, secret cameos, an amazing ending, and an amazing plot! Please note that the lore won't be the same as the game, there are a lot of changes from the game that make the movie very interesting. If you are a fnaf fan, you will really like this movie. Most people hate it because it's not the scary when it's not meant to be 100% scary, after all it's PG-13 so a younger audience can watch it. This movie is great and everyone did an excellent job at making this movie! The lore is great, and I can't wait for the sequel!",2023-10-26
"I really wish I could show this movie to my 10-year-old self, because I think it would have blown his mind. The main plot wasn't what I expected it to be, and I think it was for the better. The acting was great and a lot of characters had some surprisingly complex and interesting backstories. As others have said, the main plot twist was slightly underwhelming and a little predictable, but the novelty aspect within the atmosphere as well as the amazing costume and set design make up for it 100%. Overall, definitely a good watch for fans of the game, and a good recommendation for everyone else..",2023-10-27
"Universal Pictures, Blumhouse Productions and Scott Cawthon created amazing masterpiece of video game horror movie, I love the story, characters and not to be mention the animatronics from Jim Henson Creature Workshop is awesome.The story unfolds with intricate and suspenseful pacing, providing both fans of the game and newcomers with a captivating narrative that keeps you guessing until the final act. The film pays homage to the source material while also adding new elements that make it a fresh and engaging experience for all.The special effects and jump scares are expertly executed, delivering moments that will have you jumping out of your seat. The cinematography and sound design further enhance the tension and fear, making this a truly immersive horror movie experience.Five Nights at Freddy's has successfully transitioned from a video game into a chilling, heart-pounding film that is sure to please fans and leave a lasting impact on the horror genre. It's a must-see for anyone who loves a good scare, and it sets a new standard for video game adaptations in the movie industry.This is one FNaF movie I'm truly happy along with the FNaF fans all over the world, so please take no notice on what the bad reviews say and express your own opinions and thoughts on the movie, let's make this movie shine against the wave of bad reviews.",2023-10-27
"Me and my kiddo loved this. I'm a horror fan, my kid is not and we both had a lot of fun with this film. I don't get the bad reviews. If you're looking for silly, spooky fun with a dash of violence - Freddy's is well worth it. I plan on watching again before halloween.Really enjoyed the plot and my kid and I both really enjoyed the twists and turns of the story. The acting was great and it felt perfectly cast. Freddy's met all expectations for us. If you're looking for more of a serious horror movie with realism - you may want to pass on this one. But if it's lighthearted horror with jokes and adorable characters you want - check it out.",2023-10-28
"This is written by a fan of the franchise and LONG Time gamer. This Movie is a MUST see for any person who has a remote interest in the Games. This Movie Takes place during F. N. A. F 1 and it looks like F. N. A. F 2 is cannon (the prequel game.) They do not overstay the animatronics and use them sparingly at first, then in the middle the animatronic action picks up and the movie does a grate job Humanizing the possessed Robots (wont say how or why :P) The movie on its own has some really good shots and the puppetry and puppets are OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD. They really made those animatronics come to life! There is part where i started laughing at where the animatronics build something and its kinda weird, but besides that the movie on its own merit could probably be enjoyed by others who have no interest in playing the games. This movie tackles trauma and repressed memories in a cool way that makes you think, all the while getting super natural with it. Longtime fans will see references to EVERYTHING FNAF and Scott Cathown related. Oh and I believe there is a good amount of appearances from some memorable people? But that is just a theory... This movie is a Gold standard for how video game movies should be made and you will love it!",2023-10-28
"To start of I grew up with these games so I got all the references and easter eggs. For the fans it's an amazing movie but for the people that don't know anything about the lore it's not good. My dad sad the movie was bad because he did not understand anything about but me as a beg fan and a player of the games and reader of the books I loved it. If you're a dad you won't like it but as a fan you will love it. The acting was great and seeing Matthew Lillard, as William Afton was such a good casting. I love how stay faithful to the lore but change some things in a very good way. The animatronics were really well done and looked fantastic. Story and plot twists were both unexpected and very good. Thank you, Scott.",2023-10-27
"As a long time fan of the fnaf franchise, I loved it. However it's not exactly a movie that someone unfamiliar with the games can watch. The movie does its best to explain things to the viewer, and it's clear that they tried to make it a movie anyone can watch, understand, and love.I think anyone can have a good time watching it, but if you're not a fan of the games, you may be a little confused at times.At the end of the day this movie was made for Five Nights at Freddy's fans. I think they did a great job with the animating and the suspense factor. The cameos, easter eggs, and the jump-scares were great. The movie has been long awaited, and I believe fans are more or less satisfied with what we were given.",2023-10-28
"This is an edit of my first review and I have changed it entirely. If you're going to see this movie do not expect fnaf 1 lore because the movie is based on the books timeline and after reading the trilogy I appreciate the movies plot A LOT MORE and am in absolute love with the movie, I'm so excited for the next two. This has been a hyper fixation since childhood and reading the books has helped me understand what was really going on in the movie and I'm going to rewatch it soon to really appreciate it :) the work and amount of easter eggs the cast had added shows they do care about this movie and as I stated in my first review the animatronics are GORGEOUS and they really look life like.",2023-10-29
"FNAF fan since 2021.Do I know every single thing about FNAF? (No, FNAF games are not easy to understand sometimes...)
But one thing I do know is that this movie...is and was phenomenal...
I enjoyed MatPat and Cory's cameos.We got the spring lock scene, the ""I always come back"" scene, WE EVEN GOT THE FNAF 1 FAN-MADE SONG IN THE OUTRO??? The creators know what they're doing here...
There are some funny moments here too, (ex: Balloon boy).This movie being PG-13 does not make it a bad movie, it's still a good movie regardless.So many amazing references from the games.It's predictable, but still good.",2023-10-30
"I just came back home from cinema and I was pretty stunned. I have been a fan of the original video games for a long time and I was looking forward to this movie since the announcement.However I thought they wouldn't change the story or the lore at all. But surprisingly it worked out than I could expect. MatPat cameo made the whole auditorium go crazy. Same for seeing William Afton for the first time. The ending was too happy for the franchise but at least it was perfectly executed.I can already see how the storyline of the sequel movie would go, because BB kinda left us at a cliffhanger.Balls.",2023-10-26
"I am not exaggerating when I say that I have grown up with the fnaf franchise. I was in elementary school when the first game came out, I am now a sophomore in college.This movie is LEAKING references to not only the games but also the community. Not recent references either, really old ones that newer fans might miss and older fans will love. This entire movie the leak LOVE. Love for the animatronics, the game, and the community as a whole.I really only have a few minor complaints. The ending, while mirroring events in the game, felt rushed and I wished there was just a bit more. Also it was clear sequel bait but it's fnaf and everyone knows that Scott is incapable of just making one. Even fnaf world got a sequel. Fnaf world.My other complaint is that... it's not very scary. Maybe it's a me problem (I didn't find the shinning or exorcist scary either) but it was very fnaf security beach levels of horror. That being... not very. MAYBE a bit startling at points but I'm not going to bed paranoid. It's a shame but I guess it couldn't be too scary for the literal children that will come to this movie. But then again as I stated prior... I was in elementary (and enjoying this franchise) when it first came out.Gore was light, but the minor parts of it was appreciated.",2023-10-28
"I'm behind on movies. I've tried to watch the ones that are rated high but they ended up not being that good. Like the newer Suicide Squad, the latest Spiderman movie and Spider Verse the first one. And they were rated high and personally I think they were overrated. I really like this movie. I thought the story was good and the acting was very good, too. I hope they make a sequel. To me it was a really good thriller. And if you are a fan of the game series I think you'll really like the movie. I also liked all the easter eggs in it, it was nostalgic but didn't rely on the '90s theme. It's worth watching. I came in not expecting much. I was very surprised that the series creator obviously had the final say of what would be in this movie.",2023-10-29
"The movie is absolutely beautiful in visual effects and makes a enjoyable experience for beginners and long term fans. As someone who has been waiting literally years for this movie I would say this was well worth the wait for this masterpiece.Oh my god I was not expecting the fort scene I love that so much. There was a couple things that fell short and that's expected especially with the fandom but from what I've been told from beginners this was a ""interesting experience"" yeah. Big fan of the lack of cgi and hopefully this opens peoples eyes that you don't need cgi to make a successful movie.",2023-10-27
My son absolutely loved this movie he had been a massive fan of fnaf for as long as I can remember.In the cinema it was full of kids around the same age that knew all the fnaf characters and story and all seemed stoked at the end of the movie saying its the best. So your kids will love this if they were a fan on the games and characters.Me as a adult it was good I didn't mind it had my son constantly filling me in on who the characters were etc he also became best friends with the kid next to him chatting about the movie afterwards.Was worth the ticket price and the popcorn to see my son and other kids enjoying a movie with the characters they've grown up.,2023-10-31
"Five Nights at Freddy's, is a movie adaptation of the video game created by Scott Cawthon. The movie follows a troubled security guard (Mike) starting his new night shift job at 'Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria'. After spending his first night on the job, he soon realises that everything is not as it seems and something sinister may be lurking...As a fan of the franchise, having played most of the games, I am so effortlessly pleased by the amount of fan service within this movie. Emma Tammi (the director) has done an outstanding job at staying loyal to the fan base, while also adding new elements to spice things up.While my opinion may be somewhat biassed, I must admit that I can see why newcomers may be left feeling underwhelmed or confused. In terms of horror, I believe this is where the film lacks most. The trailers almost seemed to promise much more of a scary movie. Make no mistake, there are some incredible scenes within the film that I know fans will go crazy for. However, somebody who's unfamiliar with the franchise but is an average horror fan. The movie may feel a little lacklustre.The story can also feel a bit messy at times. But being honest, that's always kind of been the case with the games. There's just so much lore. Trying to fit all of that into a 1hr 50min movie and adapt it to fit general audiences, as well as the fans, proves to be rather tricky.All in all, I had a really fun time with this film. The visuals are incredible, the setting is so nostalgic. There are so many moments that I think were handled with such care when paying homage to the video games. My only nit pic is that new audiences might not enjoy it as much as the fans.",2023-10-27
"I recently had the chance to catch the much-anticipated Five Nights at Freddy's movie (2023) and it certainly delivered on several fronts. The plot, while not without its unique twists, managed to strike a balance between homage and originality, weaving together a narrative that resonated with the source material.The standout feature was undoubtedly the stellar acting. The cast breathed life into the iconic characters, adding depth and dimensionality that fans of the franchise will surely appreciate. Their performances were a testament to the dedication of the ensemble.While the movie might not be a hair-raising fright-fest, it more than makes up for it in sheer enjoyment. The tension is palpable, yet it doesn't veer into over-the-top terror, making it accessible to a wider audience. It's the kind of film that keeps you on the edge of your seat, even if you're not checking under your bed for animatronic creatures later.However, the denouement left something to be desired. The climax and resolution could have been executed with more finesse, leaving me with a sense of unfulfilled potential. It's a minor hiccup in an otherwise engaging experience.In summary, the Five Nights at Freddy's movie is a must-see, especially for fans of the game series. Its fresh take on familiar lore, combined with exceptional performances, make it a worthwhile watch. While it might not be a masterpiece of horror, it offers a gripping and enjoyable cinematic experience. I'd give it a solid 6 stars out of 10.",2023-10-28
"A film I watched a few years ago was an absolute delight. Its super fun and bizarre premise was unlike anything I'd seen before. It had me hooked from start to finish, and I couldn't help but appreciate the unique storytelling and quirky character.However, when I recently stumbled upon the trailer for ""Five Nights At Freddy's,"" I couldn't help but notice the striking similarities in the plot. It felt like a déjà vu moment. While I'm intrigued by the idea of a new film exploring this concept, I have a strong feeling that the one I initially enjoyed with Nicholas Cage is the superior one. His performance added an extra layer of eccentricity and charm to the movie, making it an unforgettable experience. If ""Five Nights At Freddy's"" wants to stand out, it will have some big shoes to fill.",2023-10-26
"This movie. This movie right here was amazing! The suspense was awesome. I can see why some people would be disappointed that the film did not get an R rating because of mostly shadowed\ Implied kills. This film still has some gore, but it still proves that a movie can be scary without having to be too gory and disgusting. The movie was amazing and the story was great! The story made you invested and in my theatre excitement filled the room! Fans all around the world will love this film! This is my new favorite movie ever! The actors were perfect! Twists and turns and all I have left to say is to get ready and rush to the theatres!!",2023-10-26
"THIS REVIEW IS SPOILER FREE!I tried to keep my hopes for this movie extremely neutral, as someone who can be biased. I've loved this franchise since I was younger and still do. And my thoughts?This movie was extremely fun to watch, and while it had some issues and nitpicks, frankly any five nights at freddy's fan fan should watch it.My first impressions is that the script could have been stronger, the writing itself was a strong 6/10 while everything else was an easy 10/10.Sometimes it does feel like the rest of the movie is dragging along the script but this is only in certain scenes. This movie could definitely be confusing for anyone not familiar with the series, and I think that is its biggest weakness. People who aren't fans of the franchise most likely wouldn't like it as much, and I feel the script didn't take them into account.But everything else about this movie is top notch, and I think a special shoutout should be given to the practical effects and acting. All of the roles in this movie were perfectly cast, and I have no notes. The practical effects and animatronics were extremely impressive,This movie does get surprisingly gory for a PG-13 film, there is a decent amount of blood and I would not be taking younger kids to see this. But the horror in this movie tends to lean on the fun side, it's a joy to watch.Overall an 8.5/10, it has issues and i wish the script was a bit polished. It's not a thought provoking movie, it's the Five Nights at Freddy's movie.",2023-10-26
"Where can I even start. The set design, the cast and acting, the dialogue, and most importantly of all, the animatronics. They're all amazing! The design of the pizzeria and the set as a whole were fantastic! The jumpscares, faithful to the games, just as well as the designs! I have heard people complaining about the story, but this is FNAF we're talking about. A series known for its intricate and complex story. While the movie may be lacking in some elements in its story, that doesn't take away its appeal, or how enjoyable the film is. This film is great, especially for a horror film, which are known for having not the best ratings. If you find yourself looking for a movie to watch, or if you are a long time fan like me and many others, this is a must see.",2023-10-27
"I don't know what the critics saw, but this is not nearly as bad as they say. Before i start the review, i want to say that i am not a fan of the game, but i still enjoyed it. The theater was packed to the ground and it was really fun, alothough there were some annoying people and some that smoked, but it's just a part of the experience.First of all, let's star with the plot. The basic premis with this dream stuff is really interesting, but it get's kind of messy with it's tones and sometimes you feel like watching a horror movie, but then you feel like you are watching an action movie and then you feel like you are watching a horror movie again and stuff like that. But i think in the end the dream stuff and the FNAF stuff blended pretty nicely. Also i think when it's a video game adaptation it's normal to be messy, because when you are playing a game, the storyline just gets over your head and you don't pay that much atteniton to it. But i didn't like the twist at the end. You can see it a miles away and you are not thath surpries when it happens.Now, how were the actors? Well, Josh Hutcherson was really good and the others are just fine i guess.The director Emma Tammi aslo did a descent job. She used a lot of shadows and stuff like that to make the movie PG-13, which i think is the right choise. I don't see a univers where this movie is R-rated.The animatronics most of the time were really good and i admire them for that, but sometimes they looked kind of silly, when they are chasing somebody for example, because you know that these are animatronics.At some point i thought that they will screw up the whole movie and i was dissapointed, but then it shifts and becomes better. I just wanted to get that out of the way for the fans that think they are going to screw the movie up with some cheesy lines about friendship and stuff like that. But the whole part that i whought was dissapointing, was one of the weakest part of the movies.We just have to talk about the cameos and refrences. The refrences are slick but you still notice them and i think fans will really enjoy the cameos.Overall, the movie as a piece was fine. I expected it to be much worse but it was enjoyable and i recommend you go watch it. It's not as bad as critics say. Also it's 6/10, but i'm giving it a 7 for attention.",2023-10-28
"I thought the movie was true to the game and the story. The game was never full of shock and gore yet critics are moaning at the lack of gore and horror in this movie. While 2 hours may seem long to drag out the story the movie itself remains true to Scott Cawthon's vision. The real fans will love this movie and some good Easter eggs and references to some of the more die hard FNAF fans.The animatronics are amazing, to many horror movies rely on CGI where this movie didn't which made it feel like the game itself Please go and see it and make up your own mind well worth the 2 hours. I for one thought it was great and the critics have just been to hard on it.",2023-10-27

The movie was so amazing I loved every bit of it it was so unique and nothing like it ever seen before I would definitely recommend watching this and if you think it's to gory or scary it's not really that bad but it's amazing and definitely will bring tears to your eyes at some points in the movie I love veer single bit of it the characters the movie scenes and the animatronics are great Togo watch it it's definitely worth it don't let little kids watch it tho it's not great for them but I would say the best part was the ending and the beginning is the story line but I'm not gonna post any spoilers.,2023-10-27
"The truth is that FNAF the movie is not bad but it is not completely perfect either but you have to understand that the story is independent of the games and that they are based on books, graphic novels , video games also always respecting the dynamics of the game, perhaps there was not as much gore as we thought or fear since it focuses more on developing the story as well as the references and the movie To the saga in general, FNAF is an unpredictable or confusing movie for those who don't know it, but that's what FNAF is about: expecting the unexpected, that's how it will be and it's definitely worth it for me.",2023-10-28
"I adored every bit of this movie, there was cute scenes but also still scary and tense moments making me want more!! The end scene was the bow on top it was incredible and the actors did a brilliant job with portraying the emotions of what's happening. A shocking cameo is included as well which made everyone jump out their seats! Ive never been in a cinema where everyone had so much love and joy for a movie. This movie was perfection to me and i dont care what the critics have to say about it because this movie is for the fans and they succeeded. The end credit song was a phenomenal addition also and i cannot wait for the other two movies. Excited doesnt even cut it, this movie gave me all the emotions. 10000/10.",2023-10-27
"People can hate on it all they want but most of them don't know the whole lore and that it is based on the books as well. Cleverly made and written, cast is phenomenal and the animatronics are everything I dreamed they'd be. The Jim Henson company done such a good job on creating the animatronics! My fave has to be Bonnie or foxy. I can't decide! I love the Easter eggs hidden in the film as Scott knows we will pick apart everything to find out little secrets here and there. The storyline was smart and surprising, relating to the game and books. Go see it! You won't regret it! Thank you scott!!",2023-10-28
"HELLO everybody my name is markiplier and welcome to five nights at freddy's an indie horror game that you guys suggested EN MASSE.LIKE THEY SAID! This movie was for fnaf fans and fnaf fans ONLY!!!! If you didn't like it u trippin. Fake fans fr. The amount of easter eggs and attention to detail and lore??? AMAZING??!!!!!We're waiting every night
To finally roam and invite
Newcomers to play with us
For many years we've been all alone
We're forced to be still and play
The same songs we've known since that day
An imposter took our life away
Now we're stuck here to decay
Please let us get in
Don't lock us away
We're not like what you're thinking
We're poor little souls
Who have lost all control
And we're forced here to take that role
We've been all alone
Stuck in our little zone
Since 1987
Join us, be our friend
Or just be stuck and defend
After all you only got
Five nights at Freddy's.",2023-10-28
"This is such an awesome movie! I've been waiting a decade for this and it was all I could've asked for. All of the easter eggs were so cool and it was such a treat to point them out while watching with my friends. There were a few things that could've been better but seriously eight year old me was living loving and laughing the entire run-time of this movie. I really wish Markiplier had gotten in, and that the studio tried harder to work around his scheduling for Iron Lung. The waiter at Sparky's was awesome and it was so cool the things he said I'll tell you. The animatronics were so cool and I love Josh Hutcherson.",2023-10-30
"I knew this would happen, such a hype movie that us the fans have been waiting for 8 years, i remember when the trailers came out, i had high hopes for this movie, but time passed, i started doubting if the final film will be good and for everyone to enjoy, that didn't happen. The fnaf movie is for the fans, and that's a BIG problem, mainly because of people who don't even understand what even fnaf is, and critics who want a good movie, not a fan movie.And there's another problem that (IN MY OPINION) needs to be said, IT NEEDS MORE BLOOD. C'mon, its a PG-13 movie, what would you expect? Yes, that's the problem, with such dark lore and devastating deaths, it needed more ''graphicness'' to really set up the environment and what fnaf is mainly about, tragedies.But lets just hop into another thing that i personally could be executed better, THE HORROR, the movie isn't scary at all, just suspense, more of a thriller, more ''The Purge'' type of horror. But overall, with all the flaws it has, it a really solid product, i really liked it, Matthew Lillard did a perfect job as William Afton and Mike was very well acted, the story and Vanessa isn't what i was expecting, but it clearly was a really fun watch eating some popcorn and screaming to MatPat being in the movie, a really good time honestly. The final fight at the end of the movie felt kinda rushed but really well made, it could be better, but still well made.So in conclusion, it could be better in A LOT of ways, but a solid movie, a really fun and entertaining watch, but ONLY reserved for the fans and to be hated by the critics. 7/10 well deserved.",2023-10-29
"As a casual fan of FNAF for years now, I went into this movie expecting to have a good time and I had a great one! It's not 100% lore accurate (though what even is lore accurate is debatable) but it took a lot of care to show all the parts that made the original FNAF so great! This movie was absolutely made for the fans, it was full of SO MANY easter eggs and little details that felt really rewarding to notice! The story itself was nothing revolutionary but the characters were likeable and it was never boring. The absolute highlight for me though was the animatronics themselves! They totally captured the look and feel from the games, especially in the way they moved and interacted with the world around them. They definitely made the right call going with costumes and puppets instead of CGI.If you are a fan of the original Five Nights at Freddy's games, characters or lore I would absolutely reccomend watching this movie! I'm not sure if I would reccomend it otherwise, but I'm sure it would do the trick if you wanted to watch a silly little spooky movie!",2023-10-29
"Is this groundbreaking unexplored territory for horror? No. Is this another horror movie preying on the fact humans do not like inanimate objects that move on their own? Yes. But it's based around fun characters with deep backstories. The amount of nods I saw to the books alone were brilliant. If you're coming at this movie expecting a gory horror you'll be disappointed. If you come at it like a fan of the original games would, for its jump scares and ""oh that's not good"" moments you'll love it. Also apparently they are not cgi, those are really animatronics they made for the movie. High kudos for the actors, the sets, wardrobe, cinematography, props, soundtrack, stunt performers, and the rest of the many people who went into this. You did amazing and I look forward to the next two.",2023-10-30
"Josh Hutcherson, Matthew Lillard, Elizabeth Lail are great actors. They are amazing as the characters and the film is great. If you're a fan of the FNAF games, you're going to like it. There's a plot twist that I didn't really expect and I don't think anyone will expect it. Great movie great cast. I loved every second of it. Scott really worked with this movie to find a director and a writer so the script could be perfect and I think he did excellent with the director and cast. The actors who played the animatronics are great and bring life to them. The actors of the little kids were great. It was great.",2023-10-27
"The five nights at freddy's movie was awesome. As i'm someone who'd played and watched the game franchise since 2015. I was excited when i heard that they were finally making the movie. And i gotta say, for my first horror movie in cinema. It was an experience i'll never forget. I loved the fnaf youtuber cameo's. Especially matpat who is game theory. He said that he wouldn't be in the movie but i guess he lied so that when we see him. It would be a surprise. Although i was expecting a little more gore in the movie. The scenes where the baby sitter gets bitten in half by freddy and william getting springlocked were pretty gory. The story was great. The characters were great and didn't follow the game's story as much. Even my dad enjoyed it. I would definitely watch this again when i get the chance. 9/10 its a good start for the franchise and hope it gets better overtime.",2023-10-27
"Everyone is complaining about how it does not really fit the actual Five nights at freddies lore but they wanted to make this movie exciting right so why would you make a movie where everything is predictable,The casting for this movie was fantastic i think that the people who star in this were perfect for their role especially Matthew Lillard he Delivered the ""i always come back"" line perfectly i had goosebumps.the visual effects and sound are top notch best ive seen in a movie which is insanely important because it creates a proper ambiance and that can really effect the movie.lastly the storyline was exciting yes i did want a movie about the lore of five nights of freddies but this was so good that i didnt care about that. Overall this is the best movie i have ever watched and the fact they made this impressive movie while it still being PG-13 is very impressive. I cannot wait to see the next 2 movies and will definatly be rewatching this movie a lot. Thank you Scott Cawthon for this masterpiece.",2023-10-28
"My kids 13-16 have been huge fans of the franchise for years. I was a little skeptical however, we all had a great time watching the movie. I was really impressed with the animatronics. I thought they were really cool. We watched it home. My son wants to watch in theaters so we're gonna watch it a second time. I definitely recommend for all Five Nights of Freddy fans. I like the way it ended to set up new movies in the future will definitely be excited to see the franchise expand. The story was decent could've been better, but it could've been a whole lot worse. Are my expectations were low coming in and the film. Definitely exceeded those expectations. My oldest daughter was a little disappointing. She was hoping to be a little bit more scary. The movie gave me the classic horror vibe not all the blood guts and gore that seems to dominate today genre.",2023-10-27
"I don't have any experience with the game but when I saw that Josh Hutcherson was in this I knew I'd have to watch it.I really wish that I hadn't seen Wally's Wonderland first because it kind of ruined this film for me. There was difference ie. Evil serial killer robots (Wally's wonderland) versus the premise of 5NAF which is innocent children that are controlled by an evil rabbit.Regardless, I really enjoyed the film and I will definitely watch it again now that I am not waiting for the robots to kill anything and everything that moves. It was kind of surreal to understand the innocence in some of the scenes.I would be very curious whether they will make a second film after this. I'd watch it.",2023-10-28
"Well, I'm gonna start by saying that this movie could be the reason video game inspired movies could be mocked and snobed for decades to come. I am not a big fan of the games, but I have my fair share with them. The movie had a lot of potential to be a great video game movie, but the age rating as well as the poor script writing and hollow dialogues ruined it. It needed some gore, since we are talking about man-eating animatronics, bigger body count and more screen time of the animatronics on the cameras, to maximize the feeling of something watching you while you are not sure. I would not advise you to pay to watch this movie, but you can watch it with friends on a chill night with some pizza, or with your relationship if you don't want to focus 100% on the movie.",2023-10-26
"My only real gripe is that the film spent 4 of its 5 nights doing nothing but being silly and goofing around, besides the break in scene after night 3 it's otherwise very underwhelming when each night starts, obviously the final act (5th night) of the movie is the best and has the most violence, terror and fun but the rest is quite slow, now I am biased so this movie will be getting a 6-7 from me but I can kind of see why general audiences won't know what is going on or think the plot is 'to convoluted' which is a silly thing to say imo. Overall I highly recommend it as a fan of the series but it would probably be best to keep your money safe in your pocket if you are just looking for something to watch at the cinema. I mean you could watch it on Peacock right? 8/10 fnaf adaptation 5-6/10 as a movie.",2023-10-27

"Although it doesn't follow the lore the fans presented in several theories, the producers made the movie make up for it, Amazing story, almost perfect execution. There are some flaws that i won't state here so i don't spoil it for any readers here.. loved the small gigs which don't ruin the horror aspect of the movie, and love the ending, made me smile and has several jumpscares (which is to be expected), The story was easy to follow and go through with and i was kept interested until the end, Don't understand why it took 8 years to film though.. It is one hour long, perhaps a budget issue. But anyways, awesome job to the crew who made the movie, recommend, and P. S.: watch the credits too ;)",2023-10-28
"Now this movie is not groundbreaking or anything, obviously, but it is a fun movie to watch. The animatronics and set were fantastic. If you are looking for a movie to terrify you, you may want to look elsewhere because I would not call this a very scary movie. The drama between characters was sometimes great, and sometimes just awful. There are a lot of fun scenes that reference the game or the Five Nights at Freddy's community, but you can only appreciate if you have played the games or seen stuff about them. They had a pretty good balance of keeping it consistent with the game, while making it a movie that anyone can watch no matter if they have played the games or not. The ending scene was pretty good and was my favorite part of the movie. The movie seems like it was somewhat targeted at kids, but does contain some gory scenes. The gore seemed to be more implied rather than actually showing it. I would say that this is a fun and entertaining movie but don't expect much.",2023-10-29
"This movie is super great for fanatics! Of course critics will not understand due to the fact that most don't know the story. This movie is full of references for curious fans, and it was exactly what was asked for. If this doesn't please critics then I don't know what will. Critics you got what you asked for! This is a good movie it has good acting, characters, and the plot is just perfect. It perfectly fits in, it also isn't very gory to make you want to throw up so it is enjoyable if you don't want blood and guts everywhere. Overall, this movie was good and critics will be critics. 10/10 Movie.",2023-10-27
"Even as someone who hasn't been a fan long, but as someone who has hyperfixated and tried to learn as much lore as possible, I think this movie was great. While it followed more of the storyline of the book Silver Eyes than that of the first FNAF game, it still stuck to the lore.In true fnaf fashion, this movie starts off with little barely noticeable hints to lore that you really have to look for. From about night 3 or 4 forward, it really starts to pile on the lore, similar to the first game.The only major difference from the first game I could tell was the early and/or rather late introductions of Abby and Vanessa. Obviously Abby is supposed to represent Elizabeth Afton and it has been foreshadowed that Abby will eventually become circus baby in likely the 3rd movie, similar to that of the 3rd book.As for Vanessa, instead of some random college game tester with jo real tie into the story, here Vanessa is the daughter of William Afton. After being betrayed by her father for trying to stop him, she slips into a coma. Which sets up for security breach, and how Vannessa went insane from help wanted thus becoming vanny.I really enjoyed how this movie set everything up, even if Mike didn't end up being Michael, or that Abby was revealed to late for the games.",2023-10-28
"It definitely wasn't what I expected I was expecting more of a plot light jump scare factory and they try and fit way more than I expected. Which kinda works against it in some ways, you lose a lot of the in your face and on edge the games have. That being said it's still fun the visuals were great and Mathew Lillard is always a joy and I'm sure we'll see more of him in future sequels. I think this movie is getting review bombed pretty hard because the franchise was already pretty popular and you're always going to get that with a large scale franchise. On a scale of Willys Wonderland to Banana Splits I'd say it leans more towards the latter for reference of recent anamatronic based horror movies.",2023-10-28
"Even though the movie's doesn't really based on the game or even the lore of the game, which is many people disappointed because of this.The reasons people disappointed in the movie because when they first hearing the FNAF movie the first thought on their mind are horror, gore, and also dark story (in the lore) and not family friendly and even friendly animatronics???And what's funny is many people also thought that FNAF movie would be based on the universe of the game, and they're theorizing what timelines does the movie will take, but that's not what they get when they watching this movie. Instead they got the really fun and simple story on the movie.About the movie in my opinion, is still really great to watch and you don't even need to know the lore, the plot of the game to understanding this movie. The story are really simple with some comedy that some of the joke are made me laugh a little and also the characterization of the antagonist really great. But the downside of the antagonist is not enough of screentime, just like another thriller movie that the antagonist first are friendly, and then in the last they're have some menacing story why they're becoming evil and do menace thing's and then wanted to killed the protagonist but can't, because of the power of friendship or even the power of hope i guess???But on top of that still fun watched.",2023-10-31
I have waited 8 years for this movie just watched it I couldn't have asked for a better movie. Definitely had some twists that I was not expecting. Also very good set production as well as the animatronics. Does heavily focus on the first game but does include things from other games in the franchise. The actors did very well with the roles they were given. The ending is Amazing and so is the filmography. There are a few things that I wished where different such as making the animatronics look more ragged and beaten up because in my opinion the look too new. But besides that This film was amazing and definitely recommend this to anyone who is a die hard fan of this series. Can't wait for the next films.,2023-10-27
"As someone who was always a casual fan of the FNAF franchise, having watched it grow from the first game until now, I have to say that this movie quite literally checks all my boxes. This movie obviously has its flaws and I have to caution that the less interest you have in the FNAF video game series, the less likely you are to enjoy this movie for what it is. At its core it is cheesy horror that is chock full of cliches and tropes that would understandably make the average viewer groan at the sheer absurdity of what they're watching, but for fans of the FNAF franchise that had been looking forward to this movie since the circulation of rumors dating back to the very first game, I think this movie is a great bit of fun, especially for lore fans like myself. This movie has an insane cast of cameos and the soundtrack was hit right on the money. For some reason the use of ""Talking in Your Sleep"" by The Romantics fit beautifully with the animatronics. On that subject, the animatronics look almost flawless. They were extremely well done and I'm glad that this movie was at least done some justice for fans of the franchise, even if it isn't the average viewers cup of tea.",2023-10-30
"I went to this with a friend who is big into the game franchise; I've never even played any of the games myself. I am familiar with the basic premise, however. This franchise has made quite a name for itself over the last decade and I figured that it would make for a fun Halloween film.The intro begins perfectly, with the Universal Pictures intro suddenly glitching and quickly bringing us into what seems to be the early 2000s. People have brick cell phones and they're watching VHS tapes still. We're quickly introduced to the main character and his sister.The lead is a very introverted young male who is torn between taking care of his sister and trying to find his lost brother. He sleeps next to a copy of ""Dream Theory"" much like Neo in the Matrix safeguarding ""Simulacra and Simulation"". There are also many dream flashbacks, which work effectively to show the desperation of the lead and how reality itself isn't necessarily concrete.Rubio plays a very convincing young girl. Her personality portrayed has become somewhat of a trope aligning with films such as Logan, Ghostbusters: Afterlife, etc. But she does a very good job with what's been written for her and you care about her safety. All the kids do very well in their parts.I had no idea Matthew Lillard was going to be in the film until he showed up on the big screen. I know him from his goofy '90s hippie persona (Hackers, Scooby-Doo, etc.) and it was exciting to see him play a far more serious part.I didn't learn that the Jim Henson Studio made the animatronics until after watching the film, but I do recall thinking more than once during the film, ""they look so real and detailed... the shading and integration looks oddly realistic"". In retrospect, even the way they move should've given it away but I didn't know the studio was even still operating. A very nice touch.Female director-writers are shockingly still very rare even in the current year and I enjoyed what Tammi has brought to the table. The humor was dry and perfect for the setting. NI also appreciate that the film was kept relatively family-friendly in this ""Blood & Honey"" age. I suspect a great deal of the police officer and her backstory were largely inspired by Tammi and Lail does a great job portraying the conflicted police officer. Lail and the lead are nearly the same age, though she seems a bit more older/mature visually and it works.The only real problem I had with the film is that you can tell they are rushing the plot. It's difficult because I'd like to have seen this more the length of a film like Blade Runner 2049, but that would have excluded a large part of the target audience. The film keeps moving and it's likely intentional, so-as to not lose the attention of the younger viewers. A video game adaptation has every right to do so, I just feel the plot could've actually been dumbed down more to allow scenes a little more breathing room and mystery.Overall, this was a fantastic film and continues the modern trend of video game films actually performing well. Ever since the Reebok Mario Bros film three decades back, video game adaption films have released with a large amount of skepticism; but, that seems to be changing. Mario, Sonic, Pikachu, and now this film have shown that they can easily compete alongside other modern blockbusters.",2023-10-31
"The design flaws in the story and the character interactions are as bad as the design flaws for security breach, which were so bad and baked into the game that they had to cover them up with other design flaws so people wouldn't notice the more underlying ones. But ultimately in both cases it's slapping a thick coat of paint over some cracked foundations and poor character development and mediocre writing for actors that deserved better. Worth watching if you're a moderate fan of five nights at Freddy's but otherwise don't bother, and if you are a big fan then expect the possibility of a six out of 10 level story at best. Not that security breach was that great either.",2023-10-31
"Let me just say that I am not someone who usually leaves reviews. But I have to say, the rating as it stands at the time of this review (5.7), is criminal. If you have even a baseline understanding of the story in the games, you will love this movie. As an old time fan myself, I thought there was a good mix of old and new elements. It seems like a lot of care was put into fan service, and it shows. There were some amazing easter eggs and cameos that I was not expecting, and the overall movie was just a good time. Try not to focus on the small plot inconsistencies and you'll find yourself enjoying it. I honestly can't wait to see what the future has in store for this franchise.",2023-10-28
"Ok critics I know you like all the character development and stuff but at the end of the day, this is just a blockbuster film and is really fun to go see with friends. I loved this movie and I had a really good time! It was funny and had some horror, and if you are a die hard five nights at Freddy's fan such as myself you will love all the game references and some of the moments in this movie made me fall out of my recliner seat. Also the die hard five nights at Freddy's fans would know "" the taxi driver"" and I bet you critics would be so confused when everyone around you is screaming when they see Cory, ha I'm just laughing imagining that. Anyway it was really good 8/10 definitely at the least.",2023-10-28
"This movie was so good and I've seen SO MANY PEOPLE CRITICIZE IT. Fnaf has always been such a well known and loved franchise that the movie deserves justice!! It's not as bloody as some people expected, and the rating was unexpected, as so many ppl thought it was actually going to get an R rating (totally not unrealistic exceptions....when half of the fanbase is under 17/18) but just know that if you love fnaf I'd suggest seeing it because I think you'll love it :)You must also keep in mind that this isn't going to be a different five nights at Freddy's experience. The plot is basically the same.",2023-10-27
"Even though it's not like the game itself. I still appreciate the movie. I feel the movie highlighted all the animatronics really well. I like the addition of William Afton and showing him being the creator. I would love to see this be made into a trilogy. I like how we kinda got a sneak peak of the coming of spring trap. As well as his famous line ""I always come back"", so I'm hoping to see more of these fnaf movies come out soon. I wouldn't mind seeing movies about all the animatronics back story as well or just a SpringTrap origin story. Especially one on how he killed the kills and how they came to be possessed. I want to see a lot of origin stories as well as adding the animatronics from the other games. We need to see golden Freddy.",2023-10-27
"Im gonna take this short, so the intro was fine you know a little normal, then when they get to the 1 to 4 nights nothing really happend it was a little boring but i think its pretty good still, so the only little werid scene is when abby goes in the ball pit and foxy tryes to find her he just goes away after but really great movie its great to see that abby didnt die and survived but R.

P venessa she was a hero, some scenes are really gore with blood and some are just some low small blood the jumpscares didnt really go that well they were not that scary but its my fav movie, really think it is a good movie 9/10.",2023-10-27
Quick review of Five Nights at Freddy's. Warning contains minor spoilers.I never played the games and only know of the characters from stocking the action figures at Walmart. Decided to give the film a shot and let me first explain to those that don't know me that I am not a horror fan so I was pleasantly surprised how much character development was put into this.A lot didn't make sense throughout the movie but I feel most of it was explained by the end except a few things here and there. Overall I liked it and I feel it does ok for a non horror fan looking for something creepy without too much gore.I was really upset with how the babysitter character came to her end as she seemed innocent and what happened with the lawyer who was creepy on his own? Those were my 2 biggest issues.I rate it 6 out of 10. Would have been higher with a bit more explanation. They say this is ok for kids but if I saw this as a kid I wouldn't have slept for a year. Even as an adult it creeped me out.,2023-10-28
"This movie picked up a lot of heat ever since it's announcement. I saw it on release and I thought it was an interesting film. At many points it was terrifying, but the longer the movie went on, the duller the scares got. I can't really name a genre for this film. The character development was excellent in my opinion. However it switched between horror, action, drama, and sometimes even fantasy. This movie is a hoot. I'm no expert but I personally think if you're curious about this movie, just watch it. It's a very fun film that I think lives up to the hype. As a person who played the video game, the movie is just like it.",2023-10-27
"The best way I can describe the movie is. If you love FNAF, you will be screaming at every cool little detail while watching. If you have never heard of FNAF before, you might just be bored out of your mind.The movie is more focused on cool moments and some story than it is focused on horror. As a FNAF fan I'm ok with that, I like the series for its story. Let's be honest, the games aren't all that scary to begin with.I was not to pleased about (spoiler alert spoiler alert) Mike not being related to William, and instead Vanessa is related to William. Which a huge draw to Mikes character, for me, was his relation to William. It's not character breaking, I understand the story is not meant to follow the game lore completely just like the books. And it didn't destroy how much I enjoyed the movie.Overall; 10/10 stars, loved it as a long time fan. As someone who grew up with fnaf and is now entering their twenties I do wish the movie was a bit higher than PG-14 and had some gore and more horror aspects but I can still enjoy the movie without it. Recommend a watch if you enjoy the games lore.",2023-10-27
"""Five Nights at Freddy's"" and its lengthy subtitle known in Brazil as ""The Endless Nightmare,"" is a horror piece adapted from the franchise of the same name created by Scott Cawthon, who also wrote the screenplay. Released in 2023, directed by Emma Tammi, it is available in theaters and on Peacock streaming service.But what is the movie about?The story follows Mike Schmidt (Josh Hutcherson), who, under the pressure of potentially losing custody of his younger sister Abby (Piper Rubio), takes a job as a night security guard at an old pizzeria called Freddy Fazbear's Pizza Place, where killer animatronics come to life at night. Throughout the film, shocking revelations emerge, including the fact that the robots were used to hide the bodies of murdered children in the 1980s.""Too Much Fan Service, Not Enough Movie""?I'll begin by sharing my perspective on the film, setting aside the ""nostalgia"" of 8 years of gaming fandom. The movie delves into the dreams of the traumatized Mike, who lost his brother Garrett (Lucas Grant), kidnapped by none other than Steve Raglan, or William Afton (Matthew Lillard), for the uninitiated. Mike persistently dreams of the day he lost his brother, searching for clues that lead to his kidnapper, a fact that separates the ""Mikes"" from the two storylines (games and movie), crafting a new narrative. The screenplay is cohesive and well-rounded, with events being well explained and making sense within the plot. Later, the character Vanessa Morgan, Vanessa Kelly, or Vanessa Afton! (Elizabeth Lail) is introduced, in an unexpected plot twist not anticipated by even the most dedicated fans. The film's horror, which is arguably its most criticized aspect, is weak and fails to frighten even the most inexperienced viewer of the genre. Despite some plot holes that are only clarified by the game's lore, the film provides a great experience, serving as a good pastime, whether you are a fan of the franchise or not.As a fan of the games, I conclude that the film is a treat for us, offering a perfect prologue to the games. I am indeed looking forward to the sequel, which will most likely be released in the coming years.""",2023-10-30
"This movie really is for the fans of the game. I was lucky enough to watch it in a packed theater full of FNAF fans and honestly was one of the best movie experiences of my life. Not that the movie was the best thing i have ever seen, although it was great. But, sitting and watching with a lot of fans that cheered and screamed, and laughed and all reacted to everything together was worth the price of admission.The actors were great, I enjoyed the story and the atmosphere and effects were all phenomenally done. I would highly recommend watching this in a full theater with Five Night at Freddy fanatics.",2023-10-28

I'm disappointed that critics give a bad rating in which I think they're not fnaf game fans. So I decided to give a great rating. I hope in the future, when there's new fnaf movies. I hope they'll learn from the bad review they received from critics.I played this game since I was in my teenage years.I'm a master of the first Five nights at freddy's.Please watch this movie and give a great rating so the scott cawthon and the director can learn this mistake.",2023-10-27
"I am someone who is too scared to play the games, but enjoys the story behind it. This is a fast tracked version of that story, with fun campy bits, and a good side story to tie our main characters in, in a way not necessarily expected by the fans.Great, recognizable actors for the generation this was made for. Not too gory at all, not as many jump-scares as you would expect either. Definitely not the scariest new thing for Blumhouse, more so baby's first. More CGI than expected on the animatronics but still well executed. Nearly a ""feel good"" suspense film.Overall I very much enjoyed it, from the cameos to the credits song. It's for the fans, and that's fine by me!",2023-10-28
"As a 6 years fan of this franchise, I can happily and proudly say that I really loved this movie. I was screaming my heart out and I was shocked by the plot and some scenes I weren't expecting. It had some funny moments lol! Though this movie has it's flaws like the side plots were just...plain for me, the ending felt rushed, some holes that weren't really covered. I bet that there are alot of cut scenes in this and I definitely won't describe this film as scary but rather...creepy /pos. But either way, I had a very fun experience and I was really happy we finally get to see and have this film! I am forever grateful to Scott, Emma, Seth, Blumhouse and Universal, the cast and screw, Jim Henson's and MORE!-Cinematography was awesome, cool and very pleasing to look at
-THE INTRO AND MOST OF THE SCENES WERE AMAZING AHHHHH
-Acting was beautiful and very well done and I was screaming and smiling the entire time loll
-I really appreciate all the easter eggs, references and some lore bits from the game!!!-I like the story. But yes I do see that it definitely needs a bit of work done right loll.-For me personally I didn't get bored at all and I keep replaying some scenes.I watched it both on cinema and peacock!Go watch it if you haven't or if you're a fan of this franchise.I personally...recommend it!(This movie was made for the fans though so I could see some newcomers (and I guess some of the fans who were expecting a straight up copy to the game's lore) confused or not happy with it)Overall, I gave this movie a 7.5/10 as a film, and personally a 9.8/10 as a fan
Can't wait for a FNAF Movie 2!!",2023-10-27
"Honestly I had some hopes for this movie. For a movie that was long awaited for, it was quite a let-down for longtime fans. The whole entire lore was rewritten specifically for this movie, taking away the special aspects that made the game popular in the first place. It didn't feel authentic like a good movie should be. The reactions felt odd, though I doubt it was the actors fault, mostly the writing that made it feel off. Such an underwhelming reaction for figuring out the possession of these animatronics were real, lots of underwhelming reactions in general.The horror aspect originally from the game was not met in the movie either. The animatronics are set a whole different motive as to why they're 'hunting', but their motive to hunt is mainly to kill and stuff the security guards sister into an animatronic. Considering how the children had died originally, this motive is terrible and does not work out well with the storyline.A lot of the lore was contradicted in the game. Vanessa, a character which happened to be an adult in security breach (taking place mainly in modern/future times) happened to be William Afton's daughter in the movie. William Afton's daughter is NOT Vanessa. Vanessa is a young adult in security breach and if we acknowledge the setting in the movie, which from my observations seemed to be about late 80s/ early 90s , Vanessa shouldn't even be alive around this time, or at least not even an adult. There was also a weird scene where I'm assuming spring trap had came out to fight Mike, but his suit is incorrect, his suit is the same as the one in FNAF 3. It should be spring bonnie instead of spring trap, as spring trap was not created until long after FNAF 1. There was also a terrible reference during William's death, which he happened to say "" I always come back."" THIS is highly unrealistic and not even aligned with the lore as he was getting spring locked. The spring lock wasn't even activated by moisture like it should've been. His death should have been more gruesome, and I don't mean heavily guts and gore but at LEAST more accurate. The man shouldn't have even had the time to say that as he was getting impaled by metal. I would also like to mention about the security room not being similar to the game at all, I feel like it was kind of upsetting not seeing it be similar to the game as the movie is literally BASED off the game.Just how do you mess up a movie based on a game that has SO much lore. 5+ games of fnaf full of unique backstories and information yet somehow managed to flunk it all, contradicting even some of it. Some may say the movie never specified it would be lore accurate, but it is what an audience assumes when a movie is based off of a game. When we use the Super Mario Movie as an example, the Mario movie stood true to at least SOME of their lore in a way to make a unique story long enough for a movie. The FNAF movie has failed to have that special touch of a movie. Several people are going to come into this movie theatre expecting a movie related to the games lore in the first game.Truly, the audience this movie appealed to had mostly appealed to younger children. As I was in the movie theatre, lots of young children had enjoyed the movie despite it being PG-13. Mentioning the terrible horror aspect, I didn't hear or see a single child cry or complain about the movie as it was playing. The only thing that startled me the slightest had to be the loud noises of the movie, which I had happened to be close to a speaker so I'd assume it'll be more startling for me. But genuinely the scare factor was underwhelming.The positive aspect on this movie had to be Mike's backstory. The story was honestly a smart idea, and possibly could have been fixed if it followed the lore better. Mike shows obvious traits of PTSD throughout the movie about the kidnapping of his brother. Though personally, I found it confusing how it correlated with the children in the animatronics as well. They implied William had taken Mike's brother, but that doesn't align to lore and was also heavily confusing. Your brother, which happened to be in the woods, suddenly kidnapped from a man who lives no where near this state?? It's just really coincidental and feels forced, that part of the story wasn't too enjoyable.There were wholesome parts in the movie, where things were supposed to lighten it up a bit as the little girl gave the animatronics her drawings. But honestly it felt cheesy. Reminder this is a horror movie, but still somehow these parts in the movie continue the same unoriginal pattern majority of movies have.Most enjoyable parts had to be the detail in the animatronics and the easter eggs/ popular people in the fandom which had played in the movie, ex: coryxkenshin.Overall:Underwhelming HorrorGore looks heavily fakeLore is heavily inaccurateDetail in the movie is greatBackstory for main character is decentMain focus is mostly on Mike's backstory, should be animatronics as the game is mainly about themCaters toward fans, people who don't know about FNAF were confusedUnderwhelming jump-scaresMotives are terribleUnclear antagonistConfusing storyUnrealistic, did not feel genuineWas generally boring for me. Don't expect it to be lore accurate, it's heavily off even though they tried to appeal to long-time fans.Audience was terrible despite it being PG-13, wish it was rated R. Loud audience and people whispering around me about the movie being bad/ boring.",2023-10-28
"Been a fan of the games since they first came out and honestly it was such a great experience, there were plenty of small details/easter eggs that I really appreciated. Matthew Lilliard was PHENOMENAL, just a shame he didn't get more screen time! Cinematography was great, and the tone was generally nice - it was sort of wholesome in a weird way for a movie about dead robot kids. My one complaint was that Vanessa seemed very disjointed at times, but I'm hoping all the loose ends in that respect might get tied up in any potential sequels. Anyway, I can partially see why some critics might not like this, but it isn't FOR them, and you can very clearly see it was worth the wait for many, myself included. If you like the concept of the lore, even if it's not the same as the games, this is certainly something you'll enjoy. Overall, 9.5/10, can't wait to see what comes next of this.",2023-10-30
"The movie is very mid, has barely any jumpscares since its based off of a very jumpscare intensive game. I find it weird when the sister of mike is wanted by the animatronics the point of them wanting her isnt portrait very clear and the end is also like a ""Actually we are the good guys and with the power of friendship we will beat william afton"" type. I will add that the break in scene was about the only good thing about the movie as i dont think anything was done awful there.Verdict: the movie is only worth watching if you're very into the lore of the game series and if you habe a movie theatre near you.",2023-10-28
"Movie was almost unbearable. I wasn't expecting this to be the greatest, but this was just worse than i thought. Nothing to do with the lore of the actual games. Not even scary in the slightest besides their attempted jump scares which really didn't get me. Spring traps return was unbearably cringe. Michael and William had a fight scene towards the end like this is some superhero movie. Not to mention the ""I always come back"" was so forced and honestly i felt like i could do better. The animatronics are supposed to be controlled by the soul of the kids while here it's powered by electricity and the kids. Fnaf is usually supposed to be somewhat eerie and unsettling, whilst this movie felt like i was watching a cartoon. I'll give this movie one thing though. They definitely put work into making the animatronics and they had coryxkenshin. Other than that i don't really remember anything i enjoyed. Just straight cringe.",2023-10-29
"Perhaps my expectations were a bit unrealistic, but I found the movie to be a little underwhelming. As a FNAF fan, I still thoroughly enjoyed it, but it was definitely lacking in a couple areas.Scares: The thing I found most surprising was that this movie didn't really try to be all that scary. Now I know the games aren't necessarily that scary outside of the jumpscares that they are known for, but weirdly, (sort of spoiler alert) there aren't even any real Five Nights at Freddy's jumpscares in the film? I expected at least once to have an animatronic pop up in front of the camera doing the iconic scream, but for some reason, it never happens.Atmosphere: Aside from the jumpscares, the other aspect that the games are known for is the atmosphere. The sound design especially. But the movie doesn't really seem to go for the same atmosphere that the game does. The game is quiet, tense, and mysterious. The movie is more drama, dialogue and action focused (which is expected I guess. It's a movie after all).Aside from those two main aspects that I was very disappointed with, I found the rest of the movie to be quite fun. Just seeing the animatronics themselves on the big screen was awesome, the set design was great and the acting was good.I enjoyed the plot, though I know a lot of people feel it was too distracting from what this film should have thrived in (as I mentioned earlier): atmosphere. Maybe too much of the movie took place outside of the restaurant, too much took place during the day, and there wasn't really much time spent with our main character, alone, at the restaurant.Overall, for fans of the games, this movie will still be enjoyable, as long as you have your expectations in check.I look forward to seeing a sequel (prequel?) about FNAF 2. Hopefully it happens and hopefully it won't take as long to make.",2023-10-27
"I saw the film on the day it came out and was disappointed. The film is very mediocre. For the first 50 minutes I yawned while looking at the screen.The story is boring, the shots are staged boringly, there is pretty much no interesting character dynamics. The characters themselves are written pretty badly, but at least some actors are worthy of praise, like Elizabeth Lail in the role of VanessaFnaf is a very large franchise that has had a lot of good and terrible installments, but despite the recent not-particularly-good installments, it is still quite large and successful, which means that its' fans share the right to expect a highly-quality and very well-made product.It does not apply to this movie.",2023-11-01
"I have to go a little bit brutal on this one. This movie was or what strongly ""felt"" like a mediocre movie, well.. horror movie wise. But hands downs, its the best horror video game franchise I've ever watched this year.Emma Tammi (Director) did excellent on the movie and the Scriptwriter seemed to picked the right and acceptable script for the movie (as they scrap and rewrote the script a lot).And a message for the average watchers, I highly recommend knowing/studying the main background (or what others call ""lore"") of Five Nights at Freddy's so you can really experience and immerse the movie more.And because of that, it gives an extra point in this review. If I wasn't a huge fan of this franchise and not waited this movie to be real for 8 years, I would think this movie is overall mediocre, but really it isn't. That's why I recommend knowing some lore.Overall, unbiasedly, it's alright, it could've been way better.",2023-10-27
The movie is good.It's rewriteing the story from books and its a fan movie like harry potter and star wars.It's fun for fans like me who know the story know the memes and under stand that the animatronics are good guys and just kinds but blind to see the thrut about who is bad and who is not.The fans love it for sure and like in the books and the games the next movei will be beter abb more brutal than the first i hope. If there is going to be one.And my own theory about the movie is that the Mike and Abby are a chilld of Henrys becose in the books there is the aunt Jenna who is the aunt for the Henrys dauther Charly but it's only an theory.Loved the movie the fans where all loveing it in the theater.(Critics do not know the lore)so they can 🍆😮,2023-10-27
When I watch movie the storyline was very interesting through out the movie it keep playing his dream I understand he wants to find his brother it was bit Annoying but much shout out to Josh Hutcherson so happy he is back for more acting all grown up even Matthew Lillard from scream best cast but when the boss came out it got bit exciting then it took it helmet off it just kill the movie so I just thought the movie was ok I hope there is more movies with Josh Hutcherson sometimes I think scary movies are getting killed so next time I hope for best horror movie next time like even some movies before was bad.,2023-10-28
I really waited 8 years for this movie and I loved it so much I heard many people complaining while I'm just happy the games I played as a kid got the attention and love to be made into a movie the scenes were based on books and novels and the amount of work the people done behind the scenes is what makes me so happy I loved the cast too and I hope there's a next one I think the people hating are too harsh especially complaining about gore I mean it's pg 13 you normally don't get so much gore or death scenes on screen lol. I often heard hate against the springlock scene however I liked Mathew Millard's performance and it was more accurate since it's difficult to scream while your organs and like vocal chords get crushed :),2023-10-27
So with the conclusion of the movie it's decent.I think they should've added more gore to the spring lock scene. The second thing is how in the world Vanessa's dad William Afton. And when I watched it it felt kind of short. But it was a pretty good movie. Now about the The security guard. Josh hutch is a pretty good actor. He was in the hunger games that's also a good movie. I know that some of the fnaf fans are upset a little but I know you can't fit the whole lore Blum house. I know there's to much lore. Now I think the movie should've been longer. So the movie is decent very recommended and I suggest watching it.,2023-10-28
"Looking at it from the point of view of a scary movie, it does the job. It gives us good scares, suspense and even a bit of blood (I expected more). But looking at it from the world of FNAF, it disappoints.It has the basics of the game (especially the first one) but then it moves away and goes a very different way, showing the animatronics in a different way, and I didn't like that. It's not a bad movie either. It's a good scary movie with a couple of scares and that's it. I hope that later on they can make another movie about FNAF, and this time, it will be more real to the game, and at least it will have the camera modality and all that, even if only in some scenes.If you like FNAF, it disappoints. If you don't, you'll be entertained for 1 hour and 45 minutes.",2023-11-01
"Alright folks, this is a movie you're gonna have to do your research on. And either way, half of that research is fannon, so things won't exactly be the same. It's a jolly good time of a film, and even for someone like myself who hardly understands the FNAF lore, it had me at the edge of my seat. The puppetry on the animatronics is great, and the action scenes might even be better. Watching a guy's face get mauled off by a robot cupcake might have been just as good as seeing MatPat get an appearance as a side character. Not only that, but the Sparky the Dog refrence? That was like heaven to me! All in all, any FNAF fan should watch this movie. Also I forgot the name of the guy in the spring bonnie suit but they made his voice hot so that's a bonus.",2023-10-30
"I've almost grown up with FNaF as a game series, so it was only natural I'd go to see the movie once it finally released. Something I want to say is something I see most people I've talked to not realize when it comes to complaints that the movie wasn't scary - which is that this was intentional. While the movie is PG 16 in my country, overall it's PG 13, it was MADE with this younger audience in mine. I as an adult wasn't scared either, but I think this movie is a nice introduction to younger audiences into the horror genre. Overall, I think it was made for fans in mind, and for that it's good.",2023-10-27
"A nice movie for the fans and for the people who know the lore of the game , have a lot of game references ,but my problem as a fan was that it is family friendly horror for some scenes and for the others it was perfect , but other than that it was good. I thought it would be better because it took 8 years in production ;however the performance of the cast was perfect ,so at last it was a 9/10 acting , 6/10 story: the story is trying to fit the game lore in a movie story , 8/10 characters really loved the animatronics and the way they look , 9/10 set the pizzeria was looking nice and like the game, but a 5/10 horror some of the jump scares really got me but others not , it was like i can see it coming , 4/10 action the only action was at the end of the movie.",2023-10-27
"This is a movie made for the fans. If you are not a fan of the FNaF franchise, don't bother watching the movie. Its not made for you. If you are a fan, go watch it ASAP OR ELSE YOUR LIFE WILL NEVER BE COMPLETE. There is a lot of easter eggs and references that you will enjoy, and the movie will, ya know... actually make sense to you. Also the set, sound, and animatronic designs are, in one word, P E R F E C T. The Newton Brothers did a AMAZING job with the music and there are plot twists even for people who are fans of FNaF and know the LORE. GO WATCH IF YOU ARE A FAN OF FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDYS!!! :D.",2023-10-28
"I was going into this not expecting anything great but I enjoyed it a lot! I love Five Nights at Freddy's and while this movie isn't exactly perfect to the storyline I know, I still think it told a good story. I get frustrated a bit that nothing is ever really answered or lines up together but I get that it may be just a different universe than the game timeline. Josh Hutcherson was so good also. I loved that it wasn't just all goofy and full of lame one liners, hate when movies do that. There were funny moments but it didn't make a mockery of everything. It seems like a silly story on the surface but it's very interesting and I think this does a good job of showing that. Overall I'm happy I went to see it and I would watch again.",2023-10-27
"Five nihgt at freddy it is interesting to create stories. That will make everyone dive into horror 's animatronic there are interesting characters through acting. They cast the actors perfectly for their roles. This modification I say is appropriate and good. My inner tween went wild on multiple occasions, and if I'd been introduced to Freddy Fazbear and his pals as a kid, it's safe to say we'd have been horror-loving friends for life. The loose mystery with the missing brother, the aimless cop, and the underlying fear of being trapped in an abandoned arcade where the animatronic characters are trying to kill you is fairly compelling. It's just not scary.",2023-10-27
"Just came out of the movie theater after watching it, coming in as someone part of the fandom since 2014 when the very first game came out, excited and thrilled that we were finally going to see the animatronics on the big screen.The source material of the scenes are very explicit of its inspirations from the games and the books, with a touch of the confusing lore being brought into a new light with an original story, differently from the games' story and the books' story.The design of the animatronics and the pizzeria are gorgeous and everything the fans could've asked for. The acting is great, specially Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lilliard's roles as Mike Schmidt and Steve Raglan respectively, and its cameos and references are very welcoming to the fandom. Although the premise and story of the movie is silly and probably very underwhelming when it comes to the ""horror"" aspect to it, it is still a very joyful time, especially if you are in the fandom and/or has knowledge of the lore of the games and books. I'm not giving a higher rating because while i had fun watching the movie, some of its moments just don't hit very right for me and the movie still has flaws, in comparison, what i feel regarding the movie is similarly to how i felt in the first Sonic movie back in 2020.--------------------------------------------------
The story:Mike Schmidt suffers from the trauma of not looking out for his younger brother Garrett, who was kidnapped when he was 12, and since then reliving that moment over and over everytime he goes to sleep, wanting, in vain, to find out who is the criminal that tore them apart, which ends up influencing his behaviour on his daily life, getting fired from the last job he had as a mall cop after seeing a father forcefully grabbing his son, and beating him up in broad daylight. Such behaviour ends up turning people away from him, including Aunt Jane, who wants to take away his younger sister Abby from him, much to his and Abby's dismay. Abby loves Mike, even if sometimes their relationship face some adversities concerning their financial situation, and the fact that Abby has imaginary friends who she talks to often.Steve Raglan, seeming to be familiar with Mike's name, working as a job counselor, offers him a job as a security guard at a pizzeria that was popular in the 80s but closed down due to a tragedy that took place in it, where 5 kids mysteriously disappeared with no traces of where they could've gone. With no where else to go, and thinking about the possibility of losing Abby due to him not being fit to take care of her according to people, he accepts the job.1st night: Mike gets familiar with the place, seemingly nothing happening on the first night, however when he falls asleep on the job, his dream of the day he lost Garrett is different, with 5 kids appearing for Mike. With the shift over, he goes home, where Max has been taking care of Abby while he's been working, unknowingly to him, she alongside Jeff have been working with Aunt Jane in order to find a reason to take Abby away from Mike, talking in a diner that has a very charismatic waiter that *theorizes* how lunch is the most important meal of the day (MatPat), they talk about sabotaging the pizzeria, to show how Mike didn't do his job as a security guard, which would lead to him getting fired and thus, having a reason to take Abby away.2nd night: Mike once again appears unconcerned about any happening in the pizzeria, this time taking a poster that he had in his bedroom to relive the traumatic past with him so he can possibly talk to the mysterious children if they know anything regarding the kidnapper, unknowingly to him, Foxy is on the move, waking up after getting attacked by the kid with the hook in his dream, he wakes up to the sound of the intercom ringing, with a police officer by the name of Vanessa at the door, noticing the injury in his arm from being sliced and tending to it, introducing him properly to the animatronics, Freddy, Bonnie, Chica and Foxy. After saying their goodbyes and leaving the place, Max's team composing of her, Jeff, Hank and Carl, break into the pizzeria and wreck the place in order to put Mike in a bad light, which ends badly for them with Carl getting his face eaten by Cupcake, Hank getting slaughtered by Bonnie in the Supply Closet, Jeff getting sliced by Foxy running down the hall and Max being lured by a kid (""follow me"") to parts and service, from which she sees a dismantled dog animatronic (Sparky the Dog) and getting eaten/ripped in half by Freddy. Vanessa reaches out to Mike regarding the break-in at the pizzeria and having a talk with him regarding the sleeping pills he takes and opening up about his past with her.3rd night: Mike is unable to reach out to Max, not knowing her demise, to take care of Abby, so he takes her to the pizzeria to look after her, with him dreaming again, but this time, managing to talk to one of the kids, saying he'd do anything in order to reach out to Garrett and fix the events of that day, waking up to find Abby missing, he sees her playing with the animatronics, seemingly friendly and concerned for her, in which after finishing the shift he finds out Abby's imaginary friends are actually the mysterious kids that haunt Mike's dreams when he's at the pizzeria, leading to him wanting to take Abby to the job again in order to get some answers regarding Garrett.4th night: Vanessa appears to already be at the pizzeria, joining Abby and Mike on that night shift, already knowing about the animatronics' behaviour and the ghost children that possess them, with them playing around and building a fortress with the chair and tables of the establishment for all three of them and the four animatronics. Vanessa warns Mike about the springlocks in an endoskeleton he almost touches in the supply closet, avoiding Mike's questions about her knowledge about the place and its events, and arguing with him not wanting to let go of the past, coming back to find Abby getting injured by messing with Bonnie's guitar. Mike, now concerned with Abby's safety, decides to give up Abby to Aunt Jane, which upsets her.5th night: Mike arrives at the pizzeria earlier than normal from his shift, in order to sleep and dream about the event, this time able to interact with his past dad, mom and Garrett, from which he talks to the kid who possesses Freddy, who offers to bring back Garrett in exchange for Abby, he accepts but ends up rethinking his decision, thinking about Abby and his responsibility taking care of her instead of being stuck in the past, thus he gets attacked by the kids in his dream, which in reality is the animatronics attacking an unconscious Mike and taking him to parts and service to get stuffed in a suit, from which he manages to escape and find the bodies of Max's crew, with Foxy running down the hall to get him before he flees the restaurant. Meanwhile, Abby is visited by Freddy and its ghost kid, who kills Aunt Jane and takes her to the pizzeria by taxi (CoryxKenshin) to fulfill his part of the deal with Mike in the dream. Vanessa manages to save Mike, tending to his wounds and finally giving Mike the answers regarding the place, with her father William Afton luring and murdering 5 kids in a yellow bunny suit and stuffing their bodies inside the animatronics, revealing the kids' plan to turn Abby into one of them. Mike manages to get to the pizzeria just in time to save Abby from being stuffed into a suit by Chica, by eletrocuting her, Freddy and Bonnie, shutting them off. While attempting to escape, Mike gets attacked by Cupcake, while Abby gets chased by Foxy, from which she hides in the ball pit (""Into the Pit""), after managing to take down Cupcake, Mike gets attacked by a yellow bunny which knocks him out, who reveals himself to be William Afton, who hid his real identity as Steve Raglan, the man behind the slaughter of Garrett, and the one behind the animatronics' murder tendencies by influencing them to see him as the good guy. Confronted by his daughter Vanessa, which saved Abby from Foxy by short-circuiting him, she buys Mike and Abby time to expose the animatronics, who reactivated by William's command, to the truth of who he is, with Vanessa getting stabbed by her own father. The animatronics, now knowing the truth of who William is, attack him, ripping the yellow bunny suit which ends up activating the springlocks in it, which stabs and pierces him all over the place and taking him away (""I always come back!""), while Mike and Abby flee the scene with Vanessa.The movie ends with Mike and Abby's relationship improving, and Mike becoming a better caretaker. They visit Vanessa in the hospital who is in a coma due to her injuries, and afterwards Abby shows concern regarding her friends, the children souls, asking Mike if they could visit them again, which Mike answers with ""maybe one day"". The movie ends with William agonizing and twitching inside the yellow bunny suit in which he is now trapped in due to the springlocks, being locked away by Freddy's ghost. A mid-credits scene showing the taxi driver getting jumpscared by a Balloon Boy doll (the jumpscare is used three times in the movie and played as comedic due to the character's reputation in the fandom regarding his role in the FNaF games). The credits roll with the most popular fan song ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" by The Living Tombstone and a version of ""My Grandfather's Clock"" (FNaF 2 Puppet/Marionette music box's them) composed by The Newton Brothers and a secret message at the very end spelled ""C-O-M-E F-I-N-D M-E"".",2023-10-27
"This is a most idea causes this is doesn't suck at all, I think this is mid. It' alright like, It's was overrated as good. Because It's good about the most viewed video trailer on YouTube, because this is good, But I love how Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy getting revenge on William Afton, also. Cupcake attack William Afton I think, and then... The spring-locks started It make it blood, I'm enjoying the movie. The reason the fans are very mad on this, that they add PG-13, instead on Rated-R, Luckily for now. I remember about FNaF when I met for my young age, It's awesome, This is a Best Movie Ever!",2023-10-27
"Lets be honest, Five Nights at Freddy's the video game is well known among the kids, the parents knew, we knew, so the creator of the game. It is probably why the movie is suitable for the younger audience, gore level 1, the story is easy to follow and yet interesting enough to hold the older audience. Remember the Mortal Kombat movie from 1995? The arcade video game was bloody, gory and yet the movie was everything but that.I expected the movie would be bad...really bad but I am glad it turned out to be enjoyable, surprisingly enjoyable. Josh Hutcherson was good in this movie, Matthew Lillard is just great, I grew up watching his movies and never disappointed by his talent.Thou the movie lacks of character build, it is understandable why they made it this way. Kids don't care about those kind of things.This is a child-friendly version of Willy's Wonderland.",2023-10-29
"Not a horror movie in the typical sense. The movie sticks mostly to the story telling, lore heavy side of FNAF. It's very very enjoyable to anyone who leans into this side a lot and is a great experience for those looking to come into it. My guess is the negatively is around the fact that it only has a couple jump scares and leans more into the suspense and mystery sides than the typical scary video game stuff. I do wish there was more of the video game aspect but it was still a great time and took a lot of care to the initial franchise. The horror level is moreso a beginner/youth level to me though there's a fair amount of gore in a few scenes. Nothing horrible but definitely not for folks sensitive to child death, supernatural, or blood.",2023-10-27
"This movie isn't what all hoped for. It's not entirely based on the movies, but a mix between that and the trilogy book series. He creates a new lore, similar.. And honestly I'm glad he does. We need new works and theories, it helps revive the franchise. Give it new life. It comes with its references and does bring a smile on the face of fans. Go watch it, rate it good. And help
The franchise grow.Besides, read the books if you found the movie confusing. Remember that Freddy, Bonnie, Chicka and Foxy are only kids. I love this story, and I can't wait for more of it to come. Make Scott proud, give him something in return.",2023-10-29
"9 out of 10 because I was highly entertained all the way through and my wife and 7 yr son and 9 yr daughter enjoyed it all the way through.Films like this give me hope that there is still talent in the industry since it seems like a lot of films made today are poor quality.The cast was perfect in their rolls, the sets were good, the acting was great and the story was entertaining. I had never even played the games before and I enjoyed it.I also liked the soundtrack and the sets in the movie. I'm not sure what else to say but I haven't hit the required characters yet and so I'll keep typing away.",2023-10-29
"Yes the movie wasn't close to perfection at all,cringy dialouge,change of the plot a bit,not that scary BUT for fnaf fans this movie was worth the wait. Scott tried his best and we're proud of him,don't let me mention the great casting,this movie was exactly for the fans,a lot of easter eggs and the springlock scene also the tombstone song at the end,I liked the change of the plot,I mean it wasn't really that big of a change but I liked how Vannesa is actually wiliams daughter. Also yeah Wiliam Afton was definetly lacking screen time but josh' character Mike makes it up for that. I love how animatronics were done,my favorite was foxy definetly. Thank you Scott!",2023-10-29
"Great movie ,not like a typical horror, It was much more intresting and had more plot twists than a normal horror 10/10 I would rate it . I love horrors and i watched so many but this was one was so unique, I highly reccomend to watch it .It wasn't very bloody and grotesque but had some violence in it . I would love to see a part 2 come out. I would not reccomend the movie to anyone under 13 as it is very creepy in a way but it is five nights at freddys so you have to expect it to be somehow creepy. The storyline Is very intresting and it does link up to the game Five nights at Freddie. AGAIN I RECCOMEND TO WATCH.",2023-10-31
"It was a good movie overall, but I expected a bit more after being such a big fan of the game, it didn't quite feel like Five Nights at Freddy's, but I feel like if they included a lot more from the games it would've been a lot better, but also it felt weird taht the animatronics were making forts and stuff, but honestly I didn't mind, I'd recommend people who have been watching fnaf since the beginning of the game series to watch it so we can see more detailed reviews on it. But as I said overall good movie just lacked a few things I was looking forward too, but still quite enjoyable to watch.",2023-10-27
Now the movie is not a masterpiece in any regards but it's actually a good movie if you have basic knowledge of what some of the games are about. They story is quite nice and the cinematography is also nice. This movie is not quite what you'd expect horror wise. I wouldn't say this is a horror movie per say but it's uses the thriller/horror elements to enhance the movies story. Highly recommend watching this movie if you know the franchise. Personally I would probably classify this movie as the first proper movie about a game. It's not the same story (as confirmed by the director) as the games but an alternative view.,2023-10-26
"Amazing, follows the plot to the T, shows elements of realism, follows the books and the games, absolutely beautiful visuals and a great storyline, the fans will love this but so should the critics, you need to know the lore to know exactly how good this movie is, Scott Cawthon did a great job and also the movie is perfect to have a trilogy, leaves at a great cliffhanger 100% recommend. The Design is perfect and so is the cast, everyone does their role amazingly and this was definitely worth the wait, people who complain are ungrateful or don't know the real storyline, maybe do some research before complaining.",2023-10-28
"I really loved the story from this movie, it had the emotion, that thrilling excitement, the jumpscares had me jumping a few times, this movie wasn't a dissapointment. This movie was a piece of art. The animatronics were really great. I had goosebumps the whole time.Matthew did really well on his role, especially Josh. I loved the actors who were in this movie. This movie definitely needs a sequel, I need to see more animatronics. The cameos were super great in this film, it had me in surprise. Blumhouse thank you for doing this for us, you brought fnaf to life and Scott, thank you for your amazing work. I'm just really happy rn.",2023-10-27
"When i watched this move A tear fell off my eye I was flabbergasted by the hot graphics i saw on the screen. When mike showed up and said ""it's our only chance to save fazbear guys! Foxy you go left Bonnie you go right and chica... you just be chica! Together we are fnaf and fnaf is all about friendship and family being forever!"" after this my parents gave me more attention cuz they learned a lesson from this! After that springtrap is crying in the corner while freddy and friends are hugging each other and then freddy says ""come on springtrap you too!"" then springtrap says ""re..really? After all i did??"" then freddy replies with ""of course! That's what fnaf is all about right!?"" then the camera pans away from them hugging and freddy and chica kissing and then a portal shows up with matt patt saying ""hold on... i got a theory!"" while the detectives are trying to do research. It was incredible I was never so excitied in my life This was so nostalgic! Then the narrator says ""all fnaf friends lived happily ever after the end"". I'm so excitied for the next installment i want it to come so badly and i'm so excitied to see toy chica on screen.",2023-11-01
"This was one of the most spectacular masterpieces in cinema history. This movie made my laugh, cry, and jump out of my seat in utter terror. Anyone who watches this film will immediately feel the absolute joy I felt when watching the movie.I would like to thank the producers and all the actors for creating the most fantastic movie ever known to mankind. I hope that everyone in the world decides to savor this movie.Even if other reviews are terrible, just know that the entire theater was screaming their heads off when I went to see it. This film expresses horror in a way never done before. 11/10. I would see it again.",2023-10-28
The movie itself it's a pretty decent movie with some awesome looking details and setting but the story it self can be kinda lack luster with the plot being split into a lot of sections and can get confusing to follow but the stage design and props are the main highlights of the movie. The horror of this movie isn't horror it's not as scary as most fans even my self or other people expected is pretty mellow tone with little to no gore as expected but it's still a worth a shot as a thriller and not a horror movies. The characters pretty okay some are killed off too fast or just not explored as good as the others with the actors acting either being good or just mediocre at best but I can see this movie being someone favorite.,2023-10-27
"Warning my review jumps around a lot, i just wanted to get everything off of my mindThis is one of my favorite movies, i have been with the franchise for almost the whole time. The critics don't understand a good story that was built from games and turned into a movie. I watched it on peacock. The one part that got me confused was why garrett was a character and why mike isn't related to william. I also loved how the end credits was the song ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" by the living tombstone. I was a great movie and better than what i expected. I didn't think that william would get springlocked in the movie but he did. Now my sister is begging for me to let her watch it on my phone. I didn't get scared but that's expected when you have been with the games almost since the start. Anyways i recommend FNAF fans definitely watch. I was also surprised Matpat was in it, even if he was just teh waiter at sparky's.",2023-10-28
"For me Blumhouse can be hit or miss and I generally would put this one in the hit category.Production wise this movie is really well made. Music, sound and visuals are on point. Acting was also really good. The animatronics didn't look goofy.I haven't played the games myself so I can't say I know all too much about the lore and whether it's accurate or not. I just felt that the story missed a little bit of depth, but honestly it makes up with being entertaining. I know that plot is an important element, but I've seen horror movies with ""better"" plots, but no entertainment value for me so I'll take it.Overall: the movie is enjoyable if you don't want to overthink every element (but honestly aren't most movies?).",2023-11-02
"This movie was awesome, it had what was asked for in my opinion. It had great acting, great character design, it had Coryxkenshin, it had pretty good jumpscares, it had a great final boss fight. All in all, i want a Fnaf 2 movie. Josh and Mathew were definetly the stars, but everyone else was good as hell too. It definetly deviates slightly from the original lore but i didnt mind it. It had great visuals and a good story. You cant help but feel bad for Mike, tryna take care of his lil sis while he is himself going through alot. All in all its a emotional movie with good acting and it was just in my opinion awesome.",2023-10-28
"I'm surprised the original lore was good and they changed things i understand that you have to take creative liberties. The movie was good I found the kills good for a PG-13 movie Aftons death made me wanna throw up which is good although the movie really picks up in the last 30ish minutes and I love the references to baby. The movies a good time changes a lot from the source material. I wish they did more with Golden Freddy. The cameos felt lackluster they were neat but there was so little of them, Just CoryxKenshin and Maptap I understand they wanted Markiplier. The actors were amazing and the two gripes I have are with Aftons lineage being changed and I wish we saw less flashbacks and Aftons death I wish it was more accurate to the game anyway movies good and I recommend it's a fun time especially with family.",2023-10-27
"Let me just say this: as a long time FNAF player and lore fanatic, I was super excited to see the film. Didn't expect an astonishing well written story, and I was right.Anyway, let's start with the positive. The design of the animatronics was pretty accurate and cool. Sets were nice and the entire pizzeria was very well designed. Josh Hutcherson was a pretty solid actor, but he was really the only one.That's kind of it with the positive. Here's what's wrong with the film: first, it did not follow the lore very closely. William Afton was already dead during the events of five nights and Freddy's, yet he makes an appearance in this film anyway. I acknowledge the fact they tried to make a new story line because they didn't want every fnaf fan to know exactly what to expect, but the story they came up with was pretty bland.Mike is a guy who isn't financially up to pace to take care of himself and his sister (who appears to be 20 years younger than him), so he applies at the Fazbears pizzeria. He keeps having dreams about a family camping trip where his brother was kidnapped, and he keeps seeing children (which are the human children possessing the animatronics) that refuse to give him context. He eventually finds out they are trying to kidnap his sister, so he goes on to try to stop the animatronics. It was quite easy, none of the animatronics seemed to put up a fight, except William Afton, who just kicks him. Anyway the animatronics later kill him, and Mike and his sister escape.Overall the movie was kind of boring, but not terrible. However, as I was in a theatre full of teenage fnaf fans, the movie was nonstop laughs and excitement from the action or cameos from people like Matpat from Film theory or CoryxKenshin.The movie itself is a 4/10 for me. However, I had a fun time watching it with my friends, so I'd give it a 6/10 for laughs. Thanks for reading.",2023-10-28
"This movie was everything I hoped it would be. First off, the use of pratical effects rather than CGI really paid off, everything looked great from the set to props and the animatronics. Of course like every movie it has it's flaws like I see how some people think it's hard to understand but honestly, I thought it was easy to follow, sure I'm familar with the games but the plot itself is pretty straightforward. Again though it's a love letter to the fans of the franchise, a revival of it almost to show them that the wait was worth it. Worth it if you're a fan of the franchise or a moviee goer.",2023-10-28
"The film wasn't that bad. The characters were okay and the plot was fine. The emotion hit and so did the plot twist. It drove away from the games just a little bit, but it was all okay in the end. I loved the Easter Eggs from the games and the books and as well as the guests and false rumors from the games. Like Fetch and the doll from 1:35 AM. I don't know why fans were so picky about the movie. ITS OKAY IF FREDDY IS WEARING GLOVES ON THE SIGN!!! AND WHO CARES ABOUT THE RED EYES?! Sorry, I'm getting ahead of myself. If Blumhouse actually fixed those complaints, the movie would actually be bad. The red eyes are meant to show emotion. In conclusion, this is a movie for you if you like horror games.",2023-10-28
"Allow me to begin with Josh Hutcherson your take on this film brought my review high, what you see is what you get out of his acting and with film's you have acted in you have killed it young man!!Now, If you are a true fan you would say you felt entertained all the way through for just feeling that this was it!! The FNAF movie we been waiting for now for some time. The cinematography killed it, prop's and the set were all notably specific especially the wall of painting's by the children.Could this movie have done better of course, will it be false represented no! If you wanna say this movie was expected to be better than it was well, you can say play the game, watch the movie, and understand this was well put together for what was expected.HARSH critic's seeking a thriller-like, Horror-slasher, Zombie, Vampire or witch-like movie are in for a treat because THIS WONT BE FOR YOU TO RATE UNDER FOR!There is room for improvement this is a horror movie, I will say honestly the screenplay, the story line and character development can improve. Matthew Lillard created a good space for himself and as he does usually give you want you want, great performance nonetheless.I'm sure fan's were hyped for Cory's performance as was I, the scene he was introduced gave him a great deal of hype and as well comedy and I absolutely loved his time. *stay until the end credit's.FNAF was rated (PG-13) I believe that is enough for it to be rated as and possibly we would have seen enough gore if it was rated R but then we would be mistaking the movie based off of gore and bloody scenes that would spoil the plot and ruin the story for probably a different avenue we didn't need to reach.For the jump scares's, the death scene's and the intensity of the heat of the moment I am glad with it, I am also glad that this movie was a Blumhouse production as they are very sensible with film of this kind.Overall I enjoyed the movie, I am glad with the cast, Abby played a great role I felt for her in this movie, she had a tough story but well put altogether. I will be ending with this movie could be given a sequel, I don't want to spoil anything but look hard at what we are given and understand that the character's deserve it.",2023-11-01
"After nearly a decade of development hell where the creator could not let go of his ego and allow actual artists to interpret his game, we finally get a film only iPad-raised children and die-hard fans (babies) could possibly get behind.Every plot point of the script is so aggressively telegraphed that to call it ""predictable"" is an insult to the sun rising.Hunger Games guy and the chick from You were okay I guess, but the other performances were horrendous. Also, I instantly guessed the man-child actor was some sort of low-effort YouTube FNAF clickbait ""content creator"" who was an embarrassing presence in this film.The puppets being created by the Jim Henson studio generally looked like garbage and are probably the worst thing to come out of the studio since his death in 1990. Covering them in CGI doesn't exactly help either. The cupcake was particularly egregious as it looked completely goofy and toothless and did not incite any terror. Not that anything in this movie possibly could unless an actual baby were to subjected to this trite.P. S. I don't care about who Springtrap is or the line he ripped off from Terminator. And the closing credits song sounds like an eight year old made it.",2023-10-27
"Movie was good, some theories or ""rules"" were not rlly clear but it was good. Fans that read the books and played the games were pretty much happy and satisfied with the outcome of the movie. So excited to watch what comes next. Let's remember that the animatronics are children...they showed the true nature of some things while giving us (spoiler) ballon boys jumpscares and some foxy cool scenes too. Thank you for this movie! I felt happiness, sadness, angry, nostalgic and excited throughout the movie. I am very satisfied with what I saw. Yes, it was not exactly what we expected, we wanted more jump scares and horror like film but let's remember this is supposed to be a family thing even in the lore family is very well fitted in the books, games and movie. The film gave us a lot to think and talk about, everyone has a different perspective but the whole cinema that was watching the movie with me was excited and glad to be part of the fnaf fandom. Thanks to Scott and Blumhouse.",2023-10-28
"As a long time Fnaf fan I must admit I am slightly disappointed however the movie does some pretty good things.In terms of the look of the film its a 9/10 the tone and set peices are incredible and look perfect.In term of story, its okay it could be a lot worse.My main complaint os that it's simply just not scary. The 1st one was so good because too this day its scary.The characters are fine but nothing special. Which is a let down because William Afton is one of the most sinister video game characters but in this he's kind of just evil.Overall its decent and If you're a fan, it's definitely worth a watch but If you're not a fan, maybe skip on this one.",2023-11-02
"It was really, really good, especially for a long time fan of the franchise like me, I wouldn't call it a HORROR movie, more like a drama and thriller. It does have jumpscares, I was just so happy at the time that I was watching it that I didn't really got scared, and I am already used to jumpscares anyway. I felt like the movie could be longer, Matthew Lillard's character could've showed up more, and I think they've put a little too much of the movie in the trailers and tv spots. There's some people complaining about how the story of the movie is ""confusing"" and how it's hard for people that are not fans of the franchise to understand it, I don't think that was unintentional, as they already said that this movie was for the fans, because there was a lot of references, easter eggs and lore details that only fans would get. You can't complain about the lore being different from the lore of the games or books because it's a whole new format of media than the games and the books, it's a great adaptation of FNaF for the big screen. I hope that they make a sequel, and if they do, I'm sure they will improve a lot with the reviews of the fans.",2023-10-28
"Grammar-corrected version of your review:As a fan of the FNAF franchise, I really enjoyed the movie. I loved the campy tone, and the performances were great, especially Matthew Lillard as William Afton. I do think some of the animatronics could have been more menacing, and I would have liked to see Lillard on screen more, but overall I thought it was a solid film.I can see why some fans might be disappointed, especially if they were expecting a more faithful adaptation of the games. But I think the filmmakers did a good job of balancing the need to appeal to both fans and general audiences. They kept the core elements of the FNAF story intact, but they also made some changes to make it more accessible to a wider audience.Overall, I think the FNAF movie is a fun and entertaining film that will appeal to fans of the games, as well as general audiences. It's not perfect, but it's a solid first entry in what could be a successful franchise.Here are some specific things I liked about the movie:The campy tone and atmosphere. The movie really captures the feeling of the games, with their over-the-top horror and cheesy jokes.The performances. The cast is great, especially Matthew Lillard as William Afton. He brings a lot of energy and menace to the role.The animatronics. The animatronics look great, and they're genuinely creepy at times.The faithfulness to the games.The movie stays true to the core elements of the FNAF story, even if it does make some changes.**Here are some things I didn't like as much:Some of the animatronics could have been more menacing. In the games, the animatronics are killing machines. But in the movie, they're a bit more friendly.I would have liked to see Matthew Lillard on screen more. He's one of the best parts of the movie, but he doesn't have a lot of screen time.Overall, I think the FNAF movie is a good film. It's not perfect, but it's fun and entertaining. I would definitely recommend it to fans of the games, as well as general audiences.Side note: People at the theaters who didn't know FNAF laughed at certain scenes in the movie and were excited.",2023-10-27
"Five nights at freddy has always had a special place in my heart from the young age of 13.First the cast is good. Josh Hutcherson as Mike I thought was brilliant and did a wonderful job portraying a character that we (as fans) could only truly imagine. Matthew Lillard is by far the best among the cast, I truly felt that he took William Afton's character and made it his own or atleast make us believe he is the real William Afton (but I'd hope not but he was Stu Macher so you never know?)Second the story is good, a bit of a change up from the lore but honestly I think it's good (we wouldn't want it to be a exact clone of the games. A prime example Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City was made for the fans and didn't try to make it it's own thing and really I felt I was just replaying the games at that point)
I enjoyed the back story to Mike as it was very in depth and felt very great to have nice character development through struggling with trying to remember who took his brother (which was kind of a shock that it was William and he wasn't his father but it was still great that they connected those characters together still in some sort of way. The only reason issue I have with this film is the last 10-15 minutes, it felt kind of rushed and I really wanted to see Springtap/William Afton more than we did but I enjoyed the Springlock failure (even tho I wished it was more bloody) and how the story nicely ended up.Third and final is the effects and music. My things with any movies is how well they look and Five Night's at Freddy's did not disappoint. I loved how the animatronics were practically done using puppeteers and using fully fledged out costumes to really liven up Feeddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy. The only time i think i noticed ant CGI was when the cupcake attacked the guy in the kitchen but even then it wasn't bad at all. The music and tone were really good I felt my heart beating at certain points throughout the film. The nice blend of horror genrey vibe mixed with (some) comedy and very heartfelt moments made it really all come together.So in conclusion I think this is a fun film, very great for introducing horror to younger aged kids without it being traumatizing, it's very well paced as most films I've seen lately felt dragged out whereas this movie really had a good pace, It did not feel like it was a 2 hour movie but it was!!I give this movie a 9 out of 10 only because the end felt a little rushed and some of the parts had my puzzled but over its a great film.",2023-10-27
"If you are a fan of this franchise, seriously go check it out! I had an absolute blast watching it. The acting was great, the costumes and sets were stellar, and there are easter eggs for fans everywhere. The story is a little clunky in parts, but that's pretty par for the course with this franchise. It isn't overtly gorey, which I hardly mind given the ambiguous nature of the violence in the games. However, make no mistake, there is violence and some scares, but in general, the movie seems to be self-aware enough that they're just having fun with it. It's only been out for less than a day where I live, and I've already watched it twice: once on streaming and once in theaters (which was an amazing experience, where it felt like everyone in the theater was a fan. Everyone was laughing and yelling and having fun).",2023-10-27
"So, we all know that this film is directed mainly for the fans. It fulfills that tremendously. It has good throwbacks to lore and the crucial scenes are there. Enough to please fans. But as a standalone horror film, it lacks. Now, FNaF is usually associated with violence, gore etc. And it would mean it would be an unnerving, sometimes outright terrifying experience to see in the cinema, right? Well, no. This movie is hardly a horror film. I have to admit, however, there is gore and violence, it actually pushes the limit for a pg 13 to be fair, but it is just not enough for a franchise solely built on murder, jumpscares, ghosts and mystery. I still wonder what it could have been had it been r rated. However, where horror lacks, plot is embraced. Now, there are some question marks regarding the plot, but it is mainly well crafted, would not point fingers here. Another thing I have to note is HOW WELL DONE the animatronics are. They are amazing, I could not have immagined them better.TL;DR: Fans will love it, 11/10 for them, but for unfamiliar people it would probably be around a 6 or 7 out of 10. If you are looking for horror, don't expect to find it here, but if you would like a family horror movie, this one would do the job.",2023-10-28
"I'm no accredited critic, but I am what I assume is the target audience for this movie. And I am absolutely delighted. I feared the games as a child and watching these angry childhood fears bite someone in half made me so so happy. Among the other magnificent details of the surrounding setting, the production team went above and beyond creating the pieces of the animatronics by hand. Damned amazing skill. And the story was something I could be satisfied with as a previously lore-obsessed fan. (I recommend not trying to tie Mike up with every bit of knowledge you may have on the series. If I'm correct I believe he serves his purpose as one of the few survived security guards, and he drives the story forward with his own motivations.)If Blumhouse wanted to push the springlock scene a little harder I believe they could have done so easily, but it was never in Cawthon's style to protect an excessive amount of gore. Besides, I feel we may get more of that upon Afton's return.I am so grateful for how this game series was brought to life. I'm so grateful for the game knowledge I can share with my younger siblings, because who else would I share a stunned expression with upon seeing a familiar face on the screen. It brought back the love I had for the original few games and I'm so delighted by Cawthon's revival of it. Thank you.",2023-10-28
"Ignore all the critics and random reviewers who say the movie is horrible. This movie is a masterpiece.Things about the movie that were great!Most FNAF YouTubers we grew up with show up in the movie, Like CoryXKenshin, Matpat, And Dawko! Sadly not markiplier though.There was also some references to games from the FNAF Franchise.The visuals in the movie was also pretty cool, and the animatronics, they looked pretty amazing, Also one thing for the people who say its not based off the lore in the game. Its based off the books you damn idiotic critics.The movie is a 10/10. I'd recommend you buy tickets or go watch it on peacock.",2023-10-31
"A terrible script with forgettable performances left, right and centre. 40 minutes of nothing followed by occasional scares and a final 10-15 minutes worth watching but by then you're so annoyed by the writing, poor character development and length of it, you're just glad you're near the end. Terrible. Absolutely one of the worst films I've ever seen.Honestly, actually concentrate on what these characters are saying and how they talk to each other, I can't believe this has been written by a human, about other humans interacting with each other.I suppose it would make an interesting study in how bad films can get, so maybe it's worth holding up as some kind of beacon of nothingness.",2023-11-01
"I personally loved the movie!! A lot of negative reviews talk about how it didn't fully go into the lore and whatnot, but I find that a good thing. The movie leaves hints and clues to find out what really happened and is going on. Those who have been a loyal enjoyer of FNAF found the clues easier as they know mostly everything about FNAF, and know where to look. They have been there since the very original game, hence why it was amazing for them, I am one of them. Those who were confused are probably not up-to-date with the lore. Regardless, it was an absolutely amazing movie. I will for sure watch it again.",2023-10-28
The whole movie felt like a fan film from the design to the acting and the story. The movie kept turning back on its self and it didn't feel like it knew what it was doing. And the way they used spring to be this thanks level threat and the forced relationship between Mike and Vanessa and making Vanessa Williams daughter was stupid then making Abby have a magical connection to them was stupid. The comedy wasn't funny it was scary there was no jumpscares in the movie based of the game franchise known for its jumpscares. It really just felt like a fan film that got to much money put into it like Spider-Man lotus. 4/10.,2023-10-29
"The anticipated Five Nights At Freddy's movie is finally here and to think that it's been so long (eh?) since the first game came out.Let's begin with the positives in the movie. It is VERY faithful to the games, with details everywhere. The Cameos of some Youtubers are great. The lore still exists, but with a few changes that I will discuss about in the negative part. It wasn't gory (the series never was) but there are some scenes that caught me off guard.Some things that I did not like about the movie was how ONE reveal during the ending that retconned a particular member of Afton's family tree, while also added one that I felt was intentionally done because of Security Breach. Also there IS a Springlock failure in the end and it wasn't...good.",2023-10-26
"I get why people think this movie isn't scary, because it isn't. Its an adventure movie with around 5ish jump scares. When the movie is marketed for children don't go expecting a slasher.It has a lot of references for the fans and people who like the games. It is somthing to have fun with and that's about it.Overall it wasn't that good, but it was not bad my anymeans. The plot is kind of all over the place and about a third if it takes place outside if the pizzaplex.Set design was spectacular! It's amazing to see the difference between practical effects and cgi, the puppets were amazing. Lots of children, lots of fan service. Don't go expecting anything of quality in terms of writing. It is marketed for the fans so I'd think it's mostly the fans who would like it.6.8 out of 10. It's fun. But that's it.",2023-10-27
"I'm not a FNAF fan so I'll make this review from the POV of a big horror fan. I had low expectations watching the movie since the first reviews came out with divided opinions and in the end it was an enjoyable watch but it could have been way more than that.The movie has heavy themes and a pretty creepy mood in the 1st half of the movie but it's all wasted by the messiness of the 2nd half, it just feels like a different movie and the characters feel less relatable because of how bad they are treated in this 2nd half.The acting is pretty bad sometimes regarding Abby and Vanessa, the way they react just feels weird in the 2nd part and the fact that the pacing of the movie completely change makes that nothing has weight making the viewers not care for the protagonists anymore.There's one scene that imo completely ruin the whole mood that the first part installed, I won't spoil anything, so I'll say for the people that have already seen it, it's the ""joyful and comedy"" scene that completely break the mystery of the animatronics and make them way less scary.Production wise, cinematography, practical effects and CG were top notch, the setting was really believable and similar to the game from what I've seen of it.In the end, this will be a forgettable movie for horror fans because this movie was primarily targetted to kids, teens and fans but could have been way more if the director, writers and producers choosed a storyline Instead of mixing them without necessarily finishing them and letting the viewers confused and unsatisfied with it.",2023-10-27
"Im not labelling this as having spoilers because it doesnt really but it is very much my opinion and may not be helpful in your desicion to watch the movie.I will admit the movie itself is quite good but only if you have never heard of the games or only know a few things about fnaf. I have played all of the games and know a lot of the lore and i personally did not like this movie at all im only giving it 2 stars because i know a lot of people dont care about the game lore.If you do care about the already established lore you will not like this movie it is extremely dissapointing and completely erases everything about the lore and makes its own up.If you do not care about lore then its a fine movie its not horror though the gore is underwhelming and you dont get much violence or many jumpscares to be honest. It doesnt really explain to much and expects you to figure out the plot on your own and the big plot twist towards the end of the movie was spoiled by the cast list before the movie was even released. The story is sloppy and it is not explained to well, the pacing of the movie is a bit odd but it is not to bad.Overall the movie itself is a 7/10 max i would say 5/10 if i had only played the games and didnt know much of the lore but if you do know a lot about the story of the games and were expecting the movie to go by it then the movie is not very good and a major dissapointment. I personally did not think it is the cinematic masterpiece everyone makes it out to be.",2023-10-29
"After patiently a decade waiting for a Five Nights at Freddy's movie. 10 year old me was extremely excited , so I bought tickets and I headed to my nearest cinema and watched.I wouldn't classify this as a horror movie because usually horror movies because it wasn't as gore-y ( i'm unsure if that is a word ) or scary. It was more Thriller , Mystery and Suspense.The restaurant where they filmed was the perfect location. Josh Hutcherson and Elizabeth Lail were amazing during the movie. It'd like to see in another movie together.I didn't really expect the ending. I won't say too much in this review because I would want to spoil the movie.Was it worth the money ? Yes
Would I recommended going to see this in the cinemas?Yes.",2023-10-31
"I liked the movie and I haven't even played any of the fnaf games but even then I think it was a solid movie. It was suspenseful, creepy, and sometimes funny. I don't know if the movie itself is similar to the video game because like a said I have never played it, but the movie is really good and people are giving it worse reviews then it deserves don't let people say the movies is bad it's quite good and deserves way better reviews then it's getting. It has a great twist that most people won't see coming unless you read the plot of the movie on Wikipedia or you worked on it, But nevertheless good movie 7/10.",2023-10-31
"As someone who isn't a huge FNAF fan, the movie was enjoyable. Definitely more for younger audiences and people that loved the games. The story is fleshed out maybe a little too much, but of course they need to in some ways. Actually having a thorough background on Mike(Josh Hutcherson) was nice. Actually adding elements that tie him almost directly to William Afton(Matthew Lillard). The first maybe 30 minutes had actual scares but besides that it was more just a silly thriller. There are some funny scenes and the way characters react is pretty funny. The movie stays true to the game for the most part and has plenty of references to the lore of the games. There's even a little Scream reference towards the end of the movie! The movie definitely could've been shorter and not as fleshed out but it was still okay. The cast is overall really good. Abby(Piper Rubio) was amazing and I loved every scene she was in. Lillard was perfect but he wasn't in many scenes which was disappointing but he was definitely the highlight of the movie. Hutcherson was phenomenal as well and played the part extremely well. The rest of the cast as I said were good in their own ways and every character was enjoyable to see. If it wasn't so long, would definitely give it a higher rating, but overall, pretty decent.",2023-11-01
"Loved the campy, kinda cute charm the movie had. I understand that people wanted more horror and blood and guts and stuff, I did too... but this was still very good in my opinion. Worth the wait. My only qaulm is the RATIONS of Afton that was sprinkled into the movie. He sadly wasn't established as huge of a villain as he should've. Maybe he could've just loomed about in a few more scenes. Definitely not scary at all, with some pretty okay jumpscares and eery silences, but I think the characters and story held together well enough to earn back some points as a movie. The animatronics are INSANE to finally see in the big screen! They were made so wonderfully! Great acting, too. (I love you Lillard) Overall, a good movie if you're not picky on scares and enough plenty of nostalgia.",2023-10-28
Guess the video game film curse is still alive. I was so excited to finally have a fnaf film as Simone who does love the games & books thought the film would hopefully deliver... well I wasn't scared once didn't find it funny I only laughed twice which was when I think it was meant to be scary not funny. The only things I did enjoy about the film was the set design well done & the cameos & there was good acting with what they were given but everything else was um ok I wanted to be scared & tease with William & the fnaf characters like can be in the games but wasn't in the film it was flat for me disappointed.,2023-10-27
"There's a lot of missed potential, and I feel like the movie could've been more faithful to the games a bit more, while still having a fun twist. I would have loved there to be a scene where we actually see Mike Schmidt deal with the animatronics in the same way you would in the game for at least one night. It would've also been great to see a power outage scene just before the clock hits 6. It would've made for a great suspenseful moment. Having phone guy in the first night would've also been great, as some of the most iconic lines from the franchise come from that (obviously). I feel like the movie doesn't know whether or not it wants to be a horror film or a thriller either.Actors were all great choices. I think the main two characters were great.With that being said, just like the FNAF games, it could probably give kids a good scare and be a good introduction to the horror genre. The gore in it is minuscule, although some scenes might still make kids uneasy. This is also a really fun film to watch with friends who love the franchise and grew up with it.Although I have gripes, I would still likely pay money to see a FNAF movie 2, lol.",2023-10-27
This movie is an amazing Fnaf movie. This movie may not be scary but as a Fnaf fan I love it. It's mediocre at best but the references and animatronics are amazing. This movie is built for Fnaf fans and average horror lovers may enjoy but most likely call it trash. Spoilers: OMG MatPat Beginning in this literally had me in shock. Balloon Boy appearing in the first 25 minutes was great. The gore is minimum but some good gore.I can't believe the at this movie took 6 years to finally finish. Production hell is the word u could use. Foxy is my favorite animatronic. Springtrap is great too. There is one scene that will blow everyone's mine.,2023-10-27
"If you're a horror veteran this may be an underwhelming experience - the film is most definitely PG-13 and lacking in the gore department. There are some very good moments and what gore is here is used to great effect. This would be a great first entry into horror movies - a ""beginner"" horror if you will. All the acting is well done. Josh Hutcherson does quite a commendable job emotionally anchoring a role that could easily have been hammy or over the top. He has just the right type of charisma too. Piper Rubio also does good work, and manages to keep a child character that could have easily been annoying a sweet and endearing presence throughout. The direction from Emma Tammi is great as well. All in all if you don't go in expecting something new and revolutionary or an intense slasher horror I think this is a fun movie that knows exactly what it wants to do.",2023-10-29
"As a person who's been waiting for this movie since 8th grade(I'm now 20), I'm almost satisfied. The movie is for the fnaf fans, it has cameos from incredible YouTubers who have invested years into these games(peep mattpat, and Coreyxkenshin). My only critic is the spring lock scene, in my opinion it should have been FAR more gruesome than it was. But if you are a fan of these games, it's made for you. It's not made for critics, so don't listen to them. Also guys, THE LORE!!!! A few theory's have been confirmed through this movie! So go and enjoy it, we have waited far too long not to enjoy it!",2023-10-27
"I know this franchise since it was come out. Never play the game or watching lets play video on youtube.Story is fine, but i wish it could be more interesting in term of storyboard. It feel fall flat how the story presented. It's kinda like indie vibe movie.Other than that, sound is lacking some ambience and i think they didn't put more effort for sound design that much, especially utilize surround sound in theater. As far i watched the movie, the sound is just there make movie speak, that's it. I wish they could push even further because it's horror movie, and sound is the crucial element for the theme.I think this movie is ok to watch.",2023-10-27
"I don't care if it was a full on horror movie and the story wasn't great, the characters, the set design, practical effects, pacing and lighting all make up for it. However when the movie did horror it was amazing and when the movie became more comedic it was well put together. I might be a little biased however as I've been a mostly hard-core FNaF fan since the very beginning since 15 June 2014 when the original game trailer was published on YouTube. However from a stand alone movie perspective, I see this as an absolute win with the unique plot devices that weren't even featured in the game.",2023-10-26
"When I first learned FNaF was getting a movie I was weary. Does the barely-there plot of these games really need a movie? What could they possibly use as a plot, when casual players of the game barely know the name of the played character? I decided before I even saw a preview that this movie would be a waste of money and my time.But, for a solid year my favorite film was a mothman documentary. I relish in terrible slasher films and adore cheesy shows where the writers main goal was to appeal to sexless moms. So what's the issue? Had I become old, jaded an pretentious? The adult I had always despised? I couldn't let this happen. My reputation as a lover of Bad Things was at stake. So I went to see the stupid thing.I'll give the movie this, it has a strong opening sequence! It's nostalgic and fun for long time fans of the games, and introduces the premise to parents who bring their tweens to see the film. I almost cried when I saw Foxy.The basic premise of Mike's character is thematic, if a little misguided. I thought maybe we'd discover more about him than his tragic kidnapped brother but the movie does little to flesh him or any other character out. What's the deal with his aunt? She's money hungry but she's willing to spend hundreds of dollars just to get her loser nephew fired? Why does the sister like him so much? He doesn't seem especially present in her life other than housing her and losing his temper constantly because he doesn't know how to relate to her. I know her options are limited but what's so great about him? Does she ever go to school? I'm sure there's a teacher she can imprint on that doesn't have so much baggage and maybe actually likes her without being tormented by haunted robots.Mike and Abby's emotional arc rings deeply hollow. The beginning of their story works well enough, Mike is emotionally distant because of All Of That, and Abby learned this from him and I suppose their parents, and so speaks through drawings. However this is never resolved. Sure Abby stops doing her ghost drawings but why? Because her friends turned out to be murderers and Mike had a revelation that she didn't see where he decided that the living kid he had in his care should be prioritized over his dead brother? I would be more sympathetic if (who I assume to be) Josh Hutcherson didn't give such a wooden performance. I don't get what he's feeling and frankly I don't care because he's been played like an annoying a-hole and I've been given no reason to think otherwise except for a tragic backstory.Characterization aside, I also had trouble caring about the plot itself. So, Vanessa the cop apparently has nothing better to do than harass this night guard who's life is in danger, but she refuses to divulge this to him. Yeah Mike kinda acts like he's on drugs, but she acts like a bit of a stalker. How does she know there's a new night guard? Because of William? I find that hard to believe because it would actually be way easier to keep All That a secret if Vanessa wasn't forming a bond with Mike, and therefor developed an interest in keeping him alive. And why does she know where he lives, and why does Mike not question this when she shows up at his house? Did they exchange adresses off screen? I know she's a deuteragonist so she has to stay in the movie, but frankly if I was Mike and she threw my medications that I payed for into a river, I would commit a vicious crime against this nosy overzealous stranger who apparently has never heard of boundaries.Why does Mike take his sleeping pills when he's on the clock? He says towards the end that he feels more connected to his brother when he's in Freddy's, but why? Because the guy who killed him is there? His brother isn't haunting the place, and the ghosts that are don't seem to care, they're only interested in his little sister. William Afton has a day job, so I assume he's not there enough to help Mike's dream sequences. So frankly I don't really buy this, because as a viewer I was privy to Mike's dreams and he doesn't learn anything except that there are some viscous children who don't want to talk to him. What is Mike so busy with during the day that he can't have his visions during an afternoon nap? We learn so little about any of these characters it's actually kind of funny.So like five people die in the pizzeria, but this isn't brought up like ever. Is Mike concerned about Max? Is Mike's aunt (who's name is either never mentioned or only said once so I don't remember) suspicious that her whole crew who she promised a cool 1k have gone missing? There are functioning security cameras, do they not record? Vanessa and Mike walk into the place completely torn up, and they never check security footage? Is it just live feed? This is also the second of three scary scenes in this alleged horror film. I would count the parts where Mike is aggressed in his dreams but frankly those are so cheesy that I had to restrain myself from laughing in the theatre. The scene where they're running in circles around him was very tasteful and I took it very seriously and was very afraid.I understand W. Afton showed up in the suit because because fans wanted to see springtrap, but in the context of the film, why did he make this choice? The yellow bunny suit is what he killed the kids in, so it just sort of seems like he's setting himself up to fail. Maybe it's so the animatronics don't see him as an intruder, but he takes the head off and his fully human face is in view. They follow his commands through a psychic link I guess so I doubt it's because he's in danger around them. Perhaps it's for protection, because he knows he's confronting mike? In that case just wear a bullet proof vest as they're easier to move in, and Mike always seems to aim for the chest anyway. Is the suit a point of pride for him? Again, we learn next to nothing about these characters or their motivations.Abby hates her aunt, because she's mean and smells like cigarettes, but what caused this? Mike doesn't like her, but also why? The psychologist thinks Abby should stay with Mike because she draws him, but she's also aware of the job situation and how unstable mike apparently is, so what's the deal here? Abby has a full on freakout when she sees that Mike might be giving her to her aunt but honestly Mike doesn't seem all that nice either. Why does the Aunt want her so bad? She's blonde and wants money so she must be evil, but what harm is suspected will befall Abby under her care? It'd be nice if there was a plot going on.So Afton wants to kill Mike because he killed his brother, and the robots want to kill Abby because she's a child and talking to ghosts is a skill specific to this one family I guess and Vanessa is okay with this until the robot sleepover because she cannot stand up to her father. Why? Because he abused her? Because she was under threat of being killed? Did she a have a mother or friends who were aware of any of this, on any level? Maybe if we learned something about her childhood other than how evil and smart her father is we'd sympathize more with the fact that she refuses to help this child and her brother against her serial killer father. Isn't she a cop? Why can't she tell her department about him? Is she helping him, and Mike broke her out of that because of how stupid and mean he acts?The plot, theming, and dialogue all lack subtlety in a way I find charming. There is such a lack of artfulness in this movie. The soundtrack is fine, about what I'd expect. The clothing and styling of the actors is surface level, and there isn't much of a color story told. There are certainly a handful of good shots, but altogether the way the film has been made feels much more like an indie film at a festival than something funded by a man with an extremely successful video game series. My hypothesis is there was one competent person on this entire crew and I felt their struggle deep in my heart. I watch maybe four youtubers consistently, so the cameos went over my head. Imagine my confusion at all the cheers for the taxi driver.Suffice it to say I didn't like this movie. And trust me no one is more upset about this than I am. I looked over the ocean of middle schoolers cheering and laughing and having fun and wondered what was wrong with me. What could they see that I couldn't? Why do I like other films, and not this? What constitutes a good movie? Had I finally aged out of fun? Why would Scott Cawthon do this to me? After my loyal years of never buying his games and instead watching Markiplier play them because I didn't have an income with which to purchase things? I was tormented. Then, when all seemed lost, the credits started to roll and I heard the wonderful electronic voices of the Living Tombstone. I could've been shot then and died happy. My inner middle schooler felt, at last, satiated.I think that's what was important. My favorite part of my film viewing experience, other than the buttery popcorn, was watching all those kids get so excited every time something they recognized appeared on screen. If, in 2015, you took me to see this movie I'm sure I'd be overjoyed. Most of the fans of these games are younger than I am, and most of them seem to have had a blast with this movie. I'm happy for them, I hope this was everything they dreamed and they all had fun watching this with their friends. I'm not the Five Nights at Freddy's Movie's target audience anymore, and I will learn to be content with that. However, this was released in the box office, so I must judge it as a box office film. I hope all the FNaF fans with similar tastes as me at least get some level of peace ripping this movie apart on IMDB.I hope they make a security breach movie, I hope Markiplier plays Gregory and he approaches the role with as much anger and disappointment he approached the game itself.",2023-10-30
"So I went into this movie as a huge follower of the game/story/lore, and I had huge expectations for this movie mainly for how loyal it stays to its story, and I almost expected it to flop in that aspect, but they didn't and somehow it stayed true to the lore and story from not only the games, but the books as well.There is a lot to enjoy for in the movie:
-It stayed very true to the lore, especially with the ghost children, the past about the missing kids, etc.-Josh as Mike definitely did pull off the messing up but trying hard sibling role
-Matthew Lillard killed it as William Afton and made me believe he could be this fearful man who would have no remorse in what he does and I'm very happy with it staying true to William being sprung in the suit
-I was going to be quite upset if they did not include any of the fan songs in the movie, so hearing living tombstone's ""five nights at freddy's"" play at the credits instantly perked me up
-This somehow brought in aspects of story/lore from all 10 games and some of the books and made it very cohesive cause I see a little of everythingOf course I do have issues:
-the names could've matched to the names in the games/books better
-there wasn't enough of William Afton and for someone who basically made this all happen, he had no where near the amount of time he deserves
-sadly not enough of our fav fnaf celebs cameos (markiplier, dawko, superhorrorbro, etc. Though I was super happy with matpats cameo)
-some actor choices could be better
-definitely could be a little more scary/gorey though I understand why its minimal
-not enough of the lore is in it to justify certain things, which I don't know if that's on purpose for future sequels or if its just a choice, but its not good enough for certain story choices
-I do have questions with the ending, because while it is very true to how it is in fnaf 3, if this does not bring in a sequel, then its very lackluster
-while it does make the game aspects cohesive, it does seem very rushed and things kinda clashed with each otherOverall, I do think this is an acceptable movie for pg-13, its probably enough for the fnaf fans, and I would recommend it to anyone willing to give it a try, but opinions will vary person to person.",2023-10-27
"I honestly don't understand why the critic score is so low. I know basically nothing about Five Nights at Freddy's Lore, and still found this movie perfectly comprehensible. It's a good movie. A bit tame in its scares early on, but as you get invested in the characters it does help raise the tension. To say the aesthetics were really cool would be an understatement. This movie- this franchise- unquestionably has a unique visual identity.As for nitpicks (spoilers ahead): A few parts of the plot felt a bit convenient / contrived, like the picture thing at the end, despite the fact that it was kind of foreshadowed. I was slightly disappointed we never found out what happened to Garret beyond the fact that Mr. Afton killed him; I thought maybe we could've seen him appear as a ghost or something. The overall message about not letting your past mistakes distract you from the people that should matter most to you in the present wasn't anything revolutionary either, but it's one that's easy to get behind. The start of the movie was also a bit slow paced for me, and it took a while for the horror elements to really effect our protagonist personally.That might sound like a lot of complaints, but still really enjoyed this movie more than a lot of movies I've seen recently. Its story was unique and it had a fun, almost 80s horror flick feel, which to me is a good thing. I very much liked the concepts, setting, and set up, and the little girl was pretty realistic and entertaining in her behavior.Even after the movie was over, with a little research, I discovered loads of references I missed that didn't take away from my experience for not catching. That said, I can only imagine how cool these references are for the hardcore fans. While this movie is pretty straightforward on the surface, it still has a few layers to dig into if you're so inclined. This movie was clearly made with love and, I think, represents another win for the new wave of video games adapted into movies.",2023-10-29
This was a a really good movie and the critics were mostly complaining about it not being scary enough but i think that's bullcrap because its PG-13 and cant be that scary or it would be R it was scary to the point where it was enjoyable and not like a bunch of other horror movies out there and the story was great i am glad they didn't include the whole lore in this one because then there would be no point in making more they would just be bad in think this was an amazing movie and i don't think they could have done any better i do feel like the post credit scene should have been some sort of build up to the next one most people were complaining that there was way too much build up to it and way to much was shown in the trailer but a lot of the big stuff was only shown in the movie take balloon boy for example im glad he wasn't in the trailer because it wouldn't have made any sense at all because it was cool to see him in the movie if i could add one character i would probably choose marionette but there is always room for her in the next one but overall this movie is 10/10 for me.,2023-10-27
"The movie and plot was overall good. The storyline of the fnaf movie were pretty accurate too, but I guess we expected too much? The horror scenes didn't even felt like one, and the springtrap scene was bad and corny. The actor who played springtrap was... fine, i guess? But they could've chosen a better one. On the good side, i think piper and josh really did their best as mike and abigail, which made me continue the movie. I was really happy that they also included vanessa, too. The animatronics' look were also too good that I thought it was cgi. So yeah, the movie was good, but it could've been better.",2023-10-28
As a fan of this franchise for years at this point it was amazing seeing it on the big screen. The movie itself is nothing short of boring predictable(even my friend who isn't a fan of the franchise predicted what would happen) and just goofy .A lot of people made fun of some things that we were sure Scott would know better than to implement into the movie. I won't say what happened in order to avoid spoilers but there is an intere scene that left me screaming due to it being so stupid. I was excepting along with everyone a horror movie with belovable IP and an amazingly creepy atmosphere which the games themselves achieve perfectly.it shouldn't even be classified as horror and the gore itself is very limited and mostly off screen. The only reason it is a 6/10 is because it was fun being in the movie theater with people that had such a big passion for the same things since mostly fans of the franchise attented at least on premiere day and some scenes were pretty funny. The movie is better described as mediocre comedy than horro.,2023-10-26
Was this objectively a good movie? No. But this was a movie for the fans. The amount of cheering in the audience was insane because the amount of references to the fans were also insane. This movie was way better than i expected it ti be and I can tell the directors actually paid a lot of close attention to the source material. Very happy with this movie!I won't spoil what references were in it but let's just say that many of the camera angles matched the shots in the games perfectly and you may see some unexpected familiar faces. You will even hear sounds not just from the game but created by the fans throughout the years! It's an absolute love letter to the fans.,2023-10-28
"The five nights at Freddy's movie is a spine chilling fun movie for teens and upward, They genuinely nailed the designs of the pizzeria and the animatronics I also love the amount of lore they added from the games. I really like how they focused on the plot of William Afton kidnapping 5 kids for most of the movie it's a really good way they lead up to that. I also really like the Easter eggs in the movie. The times there was action and gore, it was really cool to watch it was genuinely BRUTUAL the way Freddy bit off that ladies head. This movie had a lot of good moments and overall I really enjoyed watching it.",2023-10-29
"As a 2014 fan, im in love with the movie. The whole time I was exited about it before and during the movie !The animatronics look amazing. Clean and well built. Actors are amazing too. Mathew Lillard plays William Afton soo well and
Josh Hutcherson plays Mike Schmidt good. The end scene where Afton appears gave me Goosebumps. It could be more scary, but scenes that intend to be unnerving, are. The soundtrack is good too and the end credits ( I don't wanna spoil it) are fire. Cameos are funny and I love them.Scott, thank you ! You have made so much people happy and their childhood's came true : )",2023-10-31
"Just came fresh out of Cineplex from FINALLY seeing the FNAF movie.I would say it's good, not bad, not amazing, just GOOD.The first act was VERY GOOD. The setup of Mike's character, his relationship with Abby, and also MY BOI Steve Raglan. I would say the parts at the Pizzaria look AMAZING. Matpats Cameo was good and his little name reference too. The part with the vandalism was great and had some GOOD deaths, I remember when Freddy killed Max, someone yelled WAS THAT THE BITE OF 87!Going into the Second act. I would say that the third or fourth night was when it started going downhill. The whole idea of them being friends with Abby was kinda stupid, and took away from the Horror part of the film.The Third act started badly but the ending was GOD TIER. The fight with the animatronics and Mike was GREAT, CoryXKenshin's cameo was quite funny, and the final standoff.I would give this film a 7.5/10I'm hoping if a second film is made, it will improve on this and it will be better. I still think the critics reviews were dumb because it was made FOR THE FANS.",2023-10-28
"Just finished the movie and I loved it, so here is my honest review.From what I seen in the low rated reviews many of the people don't know the lore, or didn't know about the franchise. Which is fair since Scott Cawthon publicly already stated that this movie was meant for fans and wasn't intending on focusing to lure a new audience, but instead keeping the current fanbase and giving them something else to love.On the horror aspect I personally wasn't exactly terrified to say, but it did make me feel uneasy and a bit scared at some points. I feel like the movie would have benefited a lot if it weren't for the PG-13 restrictions it had. Without them they could have definitely added more gore allowing them to show more of the scenes with detail and emotion.Overall the movie was fun and great especially for the old fans and I would recommend you to watch it too.I'm actually planning on seeing it again in theaters soon from how much I enjoyed it!(I. Always. Come. Back. )ps. Matthew Lillard confirmed that he signed a three-film contract for FNAF, so if your confused on the first movie it's just gonna keep getting deeper. So, I recommend if you aren't into the lore yet you should check out this channel called Game Theory on YouTube it might help.. (but that's just a theory..)thanks, byeeee!",2023-10-29
"From the casting, to the characterization, to the story, I loved almost everything this movie had to give! I think the kills could've had more gore, but, I understand that they needed to keep the PG-13 rating.I liked the teasing of ""Steve Raglan"" as William Afton, you knew who he was talking about in the scene introducing Freddy's, and you could tell maybe ""Steve"" was talking about himself.I thought the Balloon Boy jump-scares were funny and a bit scary, and I don't think they were overused (there were only 3.)The animatronics were BEAUTIFUL! There was so much detail and their sound design was awesome! The low-pitch whirring and clicks to make it sound like growling was AMAZING! Foxy's scatting was a great, old memory to freshly remember, Chica's character being separate from the Cupcake was neat, Bonnie sneakily yet brutally killing Hank in the storage closet of all places was a great touch, and Freddy both being a kind of leader and yet least aggressive for most of the movie fits his character in the first game wonderfully. I loved the reference to Sparky the fan-animatronic in Parts And Service, it brought back a flood of memories.I thought rewriting Vanessa as William's kid instead of Mike was certainly a decision. I think it works okay in the movie, but it sort of takes the oomph out of their dynamic in the game setting, though I'm sure the movie is separate from the games, similar to the books.The sound design! I love how when Foxy killed Jeff you could hear the first part of the original FNAF 1 jump-scare! I love the creaking of the building! I love how when Max is killed it sounds like chopping through a stack of papers, and then they show the lower-half of the body? That was wonderful! The saws whirring in what I assume is a disassembly machine that killed the first Security Guard was like music to my ears! The stomping of the animatronic's feet? Beautiful! The way Chica messed with pots and pans was also a great callback to the first game. I loved how Abby saying ""Hello"" sounded almost exactly like Balloon Boy from FNAF 2.I love how at the end the ghost kids are reminded of what really happened with Abby's drawing, William saying ""I always come back,"" before getting SPRING-LOCKED? THE SPRING-LOCK SCENE WAS AMAZING! THE CRUNCHINESS AND THE BLOOD WAS SO GOOD I COULD ALMOST FEEL IT IN MY RIBS!Anyway, I don't have much time, but I loved nearly everything about this movie!",2023-10-27
"8 and a half years of waiting paid off! It was so good! They perfectly balanced comedy and horror in a way I've never seen before! Decently faithful to the source material too but definitely took its liberties. It was pretty gruesome in some parts too but also surprisingly wholesome! The cameo from MatPat made me chuckle a bit. Unlike a lot of FNAF projects, they don't put a main emphasis on only Freddy and actually give the other 3 main animatronics the spotlight too! I will admit the side story of Mike's aunt trying to take away his sister was pretty unrealistic but besides that it's a great movie! They made Mike Schmidt super relatable and he felt like a real person and not some emotionless Mary Sue.",2023-10-29
"All the people who don't give it a good rating are either people who aren't fans or don't know much walking in about it. The five nights at freddy's movie was fan and surprisingly violent for PG-13. The kills and story was pretty good the only down side there was was that there wasent much time at the actual freddy's it was mainly at home or the school. SPOILER: it's weird how in one scene there was the animatronics were being nice to the main girl when they are killers. They are not meant to be nice but at the same time it made sense because it trick the girl to ""loar"" her to chica. But other wise great movie.",2023-10-29
"The Five Nights at Freddy's Movie is a must watch for any fan of the franchise. Especially when it easily captures the tone of the original games story and vast lore.This move dives deep into character motivation far more than any of the games ever could. It shows what kind of person would spend their nights at Freddy's, willing. With thrilling chases and some disturbing implications this move perfectly matches the tone of the games.However if you are wanting to be scared out of your seat then you may be disappointed. Much like the games that this film is based on, this film is story oriented. It does have its fair share of spooky moments, but it is more of a thriller than a horror movie.For any Five nights at Freddy's fan this will be no problem. So if you go to watch this movie with that mindset, you're going to have a great time.",2023-10-31
"If you're not a fan of fnaf i wouldn't really recommend seeing it, however if you are, you are in for a treat !There's a lot of references to the games and more so the books! There's not too many jumpscares and there's not a lot of gore either, i also wouldn't necessarily its a ""horror"" but more so suspenseful. It goes into a bit of the main characters backstory and there was quite a twist at the end ! Overall I loved nearly everything about it and have zero complaints!The reason why i say this is not meant for non fnaf fans is due to the lack of ""story"" and the way everything plays out. Alot of it has references that only FNAF fans would actually understand. And alot of non fnaf fans expect it to have a lot of jumpscares and blood and guts when its not meant to be that.I loved the cute scenes. I loved the suspenseful scenes. I loved the way the animatronics moved and overall thought it was amazing !",2023-10-30
"I've never understood why children became the target audience for this franchise because the lore is so dark. I was really afraid that the movie was going to be like what the critics are saying it should have been- a cheesy kids movie with a bunch of jump scares that forgot about the story that made it so interesting. This movie far exceeded my expectations and I don't think they could have done better. They did a great job and made the focus the dark story that drew me into this series. The acting was amazing as well, I can't believe they were able to get such a great cast. This is definitely a win for the adult fans of the series. I hope there's a sequel!",2023-10-29
"I feel most people watching this movie went in with the wrong expectation, they believed it would be a game adaptation which is clearly not what it was supposed to be, it's it's own story and it does so fantastically, if you know fnaf beyond the surface level instead of just watching markiplier or jacksepeticeye play it then you'll love this film, it's 2hours of constant references and call backs that aren't forced in, a majority of them are subtle so you will need a keen eye, even then if you know nothing of fnaf you will also enjoy this movie as it is simply a good movie by itself, that being said with the references and callbacks it doesn't shy away from being its own movie and the parts it does on its own are done wonderfully, i truly hope this movie gets a sequel like it deserves and doesn't let the unknowing majority ruin it, the only complaint i've heard and agreed with is the lack of horror but that doesn't bother me as the movie is still excellent. This movie clearly has a lot of passion put into it and i hope this becomes the new standard for movies going forward.",2023-10-27
"My kids like scary movies but I do not let them watch movies that will destroy their lives. There is no nudity, minimum blood and a few surprises. It was great that my teenagers were still able to sleep that night. I think it could have used a little more in the plot department, but I am an adult. My teenagers thought the movie was great. I will not ruin it with spoilers but a few things that happened i did not see coming. I appreciated that it did not actually show anyone being murdered, I think that would be a little too much for the age range the movie is aimed at. I don't understand the negative reviews. It is a movie for kids and teens and I felt it was appropriate for them. Scary but not life damaging scary.",2023-10-29
"Spoilers.If you've been a fan for years and watched theory vids, you will pretty much like it, very much too very possibly.(it's just a theory)
I liked that the start crt/pixelated scene has purpleguyI would've liked there to bee a liiittle bit moore blood on the springlock scene and a louder scream but it was great still.The lore, the Lore, THE LORE.This changes very much about the known and theorised stuff or like not very much but still.It has lots of good easter eggs & references even to fan theories that even didn't exist before in the games.They used actual robotics!!!!!!!!",2023-10-28
"I absolutely loved the adaptation, the acting was amazing and surprisingly for a five nights at freddy's film, the plot was easy to follow, I must admit there were a few plot holes but many of them were unimportant and didn't really affect the whole storymany people may have disliked the film due to it not being as gory or not being ""canon"" to the games though this film is a completely different canon in the same continuity, we have the same lovable characters from the games along with the same story line regarding the missing children and personally for me it's such a great film to watch especially if your a fan of the games like me.",2023-10-27
"I've been waiting for the FNAF movie since I was 8 years old, as many have my friends. I thought the movie was amazing, it was greatly developed and I loved Josh Hutcherson, Matthew Lillard, CoryKenshin, and so many other of the actors in the film.I think this was a good start for Blumhouse with the first movie. Was I slightly disappointed that the Springlock malfunction wasn't as gory? Of course but they knew who their target audience was. There were a lot of things that didn't happen in the movie, gore and horror wise, because of the target audience, to which I understand.The movie was a solid 8/10, it had its comedy moments, and it's slightly more suspenseful moments. It makes a good movie for parents to see with their kids too as a nice spooky movie if they don't know what FNAF is. The cast was great and the movie definitely made me laugh and made me like gasp a couple times.I know some people were upset with how it came out but I truly thought it was nice for the first real FNAF movie ever made and can't wait for if they make a second one.I'm also glad they added 'It's Been So Long' by The Living Tombstone at the credits. It brought back so many childhood memories and phases of their music.Definitely see it, even if it's once.",2023-10-29
"From start to finish, I enjoyed every second. This film really felt like a love letter to the fans of this franchise, people who have been there all the way back in 2014 when the first game was released. Seeing all of the iconic easter eggs and cameos of people important to the franchise was really cool to see! All in all, the only thing that was wrong with this movie was the runtime. Believe me, I would have sat through a 3 hour fnaf movie because I love this franchise so much!All of the actors and actresses did amazingly too, I really enjoyed seeing them all on the big screen! Also, big props to Scott Cawthon, Emma Tammi, and Blumhouse Studios for making this movie!",2023-10-28
"Loved the movie great music. Loved the cameos let's just say that Markiplier made a very small appearance. Alot of references. It's a movie for the fans if you don't know anything about fnaf you will still have a good time. With that being said there are some scenes that are like wait they did that!!!! Since this is a spoiler free review let's just say there are some animatronic fight scenes, I won't say who but one of them have not been in the trailers a small but important character. Now the cameos I will be saying the names of who appears in the movie if you want to be surprised skip this part. Game Theory, Dawko, cory Kenison, Markiplier, and more!!! Now golden Freddy turns out to be familiar with William Afton. Movie got a 7/10 for me.",2023-10-25
The movie was boring and there was barely any use of the animatronics. The story line didn't go along with the game story line really at all and the acting was pretty mid along with the corny and not really funny jokes. Everything was really predictable in this movie and after hearing about Scott Cawthon talk about how there would be a lot of gore in this movie that he wasn't even sure it would be allowed in theaters to see that there was barley to almost no gore in the entire movie was really a let down. The movie wasn't even scary! As a FNAF fan since 2014 it's really disappointing to have been waiting 8 YEARS for a movie that just overall sucked.,2023-10-28
The Five nights at Freddy's movie was a great representation of the original game. It stuck to the plot of the actually game which I appreciate because I alot of movies based off games don't follow the plot of the game. The costumes/animatonics were amazing and did not disappoint us. They were identical to the animated versions. However it wasn't a scary as I thought it would be. Barely any jump scares which I wish I could've seen more. I didn't really play the game a lot growing up but u still understood what was happening. I wish I would have played it before watching so I could've appreciate the easter eggs more. However I would definitely watch this movie again.,2023-11-01
"To be honest, I wasn't expecting this to be anything more than a crappy, lazy, slapped together low-effort, video game movie. However, I was pleasantly surprised with an engaging thriller that kept me at the edge of my seat throughout. This movie is obviously one that is going to be enjoyed more by fans than by newcomers: The crowd in my audience, all composed of hardcore FNAF fans were cheering and clapping all the time throughout the movie and filled our theater with pure magical cinematic energy that people new to the series couldn't up but join in on. This movie is also good even if you're not a fan of the franchise. The animatronic designs look absolutely gorgeous and can be appreciated even by those who the farthest outside the community. Josh Hutcherson's character and is relationships with his sister is captivating and is a great drive for the story. The kills, although tame, are also delightful fun for fans of horror. This movie does feel a bit rushed at points , ignores some of the main plot lines in the third act, and is inconclusive, but that doesn't slow it down too much. This movie is great for fans, casual horror watchers, and people who want to get into horror and will do a good job of providing some Halloween spooks for anyone else.",2023-10-28
"My girlfriend and I are knowledgeable about FNF movies from the beginning of FNF games. To be honest, we have a great time watching it and truly love it. It's so enjoyable. It has come to my attention that non-FNAF fans are hanging out with them, even if they are not fans. This movie will never be understood by those who are not fans. I know that they give it negative reviews, saying 'it's not scary and boring.' This movie doesn't mean scary; it just tells a lore. When you go with someone who is a fan of FNAF, it will be easier for them to explain the FNAF lore to you. I'd like to say that it's more likely for you to be more ""puzzled sense"" about this story when you're with FANF fans. Don't listen to reviews from non-FNAF fans. Only listen to FNAF fans. My hope is that everyone understands what I'm saying, thank you. (It's my opinion)",2023-10-27
It got most icon scenes in it and the plot in it. They change a little bit in the story but it made it only more excited they kept the character and everything. And it's awesome that Matthew Lillard takes place in the movie. In my own opinion the movie is more for the fans and it wouldn't be as amazing for people outside of the fandom. I don't get all hate because it is honestly an amazing movie and worth watching and it got some important details that really put you back in the games and the fandom. They may not show all icon scenes as it was in the canon OG storyline but they are showing most of it in one or another way. I recommend seeing it in the cinema! The only thing was lack of FNAF songs in the credits.,2023-10-27
"I never played the video game, did not even see any of the previews. I just seen it on peacock. I watched it. I loved it, it had a easy storyline to follow. No sex, no naked scenes. If your were no even a fan, like i was. You should enjoy this movie. Jim henson studio who did the 1st turtle movies came back for this outstanding movie. It had good CGI effects, I know some people who took children who were younger then 10 to see it at the movies. The kids enjoyed it. I hope they make a part 2 to this movie or hack even a series. This is alot better then a reboot of a old movie. We need more original movies like this.",2023-10-28
"Before I heard the news of the Five Nights at Freddy's movie, my awareness of the franchise was quite little. Though the games intrigued me, I refrained from diving into the games due to some past trauma that made it difficult for me to enjoy horror. Nevertheless, I enjoyed delving into the game's lore, immersing myself in its complex mildly incoherent narrative.In preparation for the movie, I decided to watch the video titled ""Five Nights at Freddy's Lore in Only 8:47:38 Complete History, Timeline Before the Movie #Fnaf."" This proved to be a great asset, equipping me with the knowledge needed to appreciate the film. It allowed me to grasp the myriad references, comprehend the profound impacts of the reveals, and stay engaged with the non-stop plot.The film itself is filled with intricate plotlines and rich lore. What stood out to me was the meticulous attention to detail, particularly in the faithful recreation of the security room from the game. As I followed the story, it became evident that the final revelation was somewhat predictable, yet incredibly satisfying.One of the most endearing aspects of the movie was the animatronics. They were so cute and cuddly! I just wanted to give all of them a nice warm (probably cold lol) hug. I already had the expectation that these animatronics weren't necessarily the ""bad guys,"" which made it easier for me to watch the movie. Horror and tension typically triger me, evoking traumatic memories, so I often resort to covering my eyes and ears during such scenes. However, this film presented a unique opportunity, as it was essentially a horror experience tailored for a younger audience, hence the absence of excessive gore. Miraculously, I only had to shield my eyes during two scenes, a feat I consider remarkable.For context, when I watched ""The Nun"" in theaters, I practically hid my face and wore headphones for the grand majority of the film, overwhelmed by its horror. Similarly, during ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,"" I couldn't endure a significant portion of the scenes and ended up covering my eyes for about 40% of the movie. This movie, however, offered a glimmer of hope that I could eventually watch horror films without succumbing to triggers.In sum, my experience with the Five Nights at Freddy's movie was an absolute delight. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, and I'm left hoping for sequels in this universe!",2023-10-27
"Hello i'm azal, I've been a fan since 2015 (back when i was 12..now i'm 20) and i've waited 8 years for this movie, my mom used to not believe me when i tell her there's gonna be a movie a few years back, watched it today with my mom and little sister, they know nothing about the games nor lore but we enjoyed it, the whole time we were gasping,screaming and laughing together, best day ever , the gore..the references the music it was incredible, the shots were taken perfectly, congrats for us,all as fnaf fans and scott,blumhouse too,they did a fantastic job! The actors were amazing.. very talented cast, We shall keep this movie in our hearts and remember the good times from 8 years ago, love you all stay safe and support this movie please it's worth the watch.",2023-10-27
"Playing and watching the FNAF game back in the day I was curious as to if this movie would deliver the same feeling that those experiences did. You can say that in times it did, however the story is choppy and not really cohesive. Aspects of the plot are somewhat captivating but executed poorly. There was a moment in the second half of the movie where I found the dialog to be quite off putting and perfect for a horror movie, but the problem is that I couldn't tell if this moment was intentional or and actor/actress doing their best with the script that was provided. I do think that the aesthetic of the movie is great and that Freddy's as an atmosphere works really well. As a fan service I think that a 7/10 is deserved almost for this reason alone. The animatronics feel threatening and very in control of their environment but the movie in my eyes is suffering because they tried to do to much with the plot.",2023-10-28
"The movie was a great love letter to the fans of FNAF. If you played any of the games, watched lore videos, or read any of the books you will probably enjoy this movie. I also think people who aren't big FNAF Fans or don't know anything about FNAF will still be entertained by this movie. There are problems pacing and tone wise with the movie at times, the story is very by the books not breaking any barriers in cinema. The acting in the movie is good everybody does their parts well. The Animatronics scenes of the movie are by far the best parts of the movie. I can't wait for what they do for part 2.",2023-10-27
"It's a little ridiculous but nevertheless pretty fun to watch. It's not a movie for critics or typical moviegoers because they will say it's a bad movie. It's only for the people who are familiar with the games. Anybody not will be kinda confused why the storyline that people are familiar with is alterated to be slighty different from the games. Otherwise, it's a good movie for fans of the games but i repeat NOT FOR CRITICS OR MOVIEGOERS. This is only for FNAF fans. Hopefully those who read my review are aware that despite if you want to watch it, you need to play the games in order to see it.",2023-10-30
"I took my brother and his friend, both of which have been longtime fans. I myself, however, have only been a fan for a few years. Despite the differences, we were all able to understand every reference and each one left us silently jumping in our seats. It doesn't matter if you're a newer fan with basic knowledge or an older fan who was around when William Afton was called Vincent, every FNAF fan will adore this movie. Every actor, including the kids, did a wonderful job. You could feel the sense of horror radiating off them through the screen. Josh and Elizabeth were absolutely amazing; Mathew Lillard as William Afton was peak casting, and while he didn't have much screen time you could just feel his presence in every scene. The animatronics had some unexpected qualities but it only made me have more sympathy for the victims of Afton. Jim Henson Company and the actors in the suits did a spectacular job giving the animatronics a life like feel to them, most of the time I forgot they weren't real bc they just felt so lifelike. It did however feel like they took different things from the first couple of games and combined them into one film, which isn't a bad thing because it all flowed perfectly. The storyline and lore isn't entirely same as the games, but it is an amazing standalone film that was clearly made by fans who adored the games.. Overall; if you enjoy a thriller with a good story and plotbut understand that the fnaf lore is ever changing, then you'll love this movie.",2023-10-29
"Perfection. That's the word that comes to mind when attempting to describe the cinematic experience that is ""Five Nights at Freddy's: The Movie."" The long-anticipated film adaptation of the popular horror game franchise has exceeded all expectations and delivered a truly unforgettable experience for fans and newcomers alike.At its core, ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" is known for its ability to terrify players with a combination of jump scares, eerie animatronic characters, and an overall atmosphere of dread. The movie flawlessly captures these elements, making it an exceptional adaptation that stays true to its source material while adding new layers of depth to the story.One of the most impressive aspects of the film is its impeccable casting. The lead role of the night security guard, Mike Schmidt, is portrayed by an outstanding actor who brings a perfect blend of vulnerability and determination to the character. As viewers follow Mike through his five consecutive nights of terror, they can't help but empathize with his growing sense of dread and isolation.The animatronic characters are brought to life with astonishing animatronics and visual effects. Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Bunny, Chica the Chicken, and Foxy the Pirate Fox are meticulously crafted, down to the smallest details. The animatronics' movements are uncannily realistic, and the film doesn't shy away from showcasing their menacing nature. The tension that builds as they roam the restaurant after hours is palpable, creating a relentless sense of impending doom.The script deserves special praise for its ingenuity. It not only maintains the core storyline of the game but also delves deeper into the lore of the ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" universe. Through cleverly placed flashbacks and well-timed revelations, the movie provides answers to long-standing mysteries while introducing new enigmas that will leave audiences in awe. The narrative is both self-contained and part of a larger cinematic universe, leaving room for potential sequels.The film's pacing is another strong suit. It expertly balances moments of intense terror with quieter, character-driven scenes that allow the audience to catch their breath and invest emotionally in the story. This ebb and flow keeps viewers engaged and ensures that the scares hit harder when they do arrive.The soundtrack deserves its own accolades. The film's score, composed by a talented musician, complements the suspenseful atmosphere with haunting melodies and tense crescendos. The use of sound in the movie is nothing short of exceptional, as it creates an immersive experience that lingers long after the credits roll.Director [Director's Name] deserves immense credit for his masterful handling of the material. He exhibits a deep understanding of what makes the ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" franchise so compelling and translates it seamlessly to the big screen. The director's meticulous attention to detail in every frame of the film is evident, and his ability to maintain a consistent tone of dread throughout is a testament to his skill.The film is not without its moments of heart-pounding terror. It capitalizes on the inherent fear of the unknown and the uncanny valley effect, where the animatronics' almost-human appearances only make them more horrifying. Jump scares are used sparingly but effectively, making each one genuinely shocking and memorable.Moreover, the movie's conclusion is a stroke of brilliance. It manages to provide both closure and open-ended questions, leaving the door wide open for future installments. As the credits rolled, the audience was left in stunned silence, contemplating the implications of what they had just witnessed.In terms of visual effects, ""Five Nights at Freddy's: The Movie"" is a triumph. The seamless integration of practical effects and CGI is nothing short of remarkable. The animatronics are so convincing that it's easy to forget they are not real, which only heightens the sense of dread.This film is also a testament to the power of fan-driven projects. The creators of ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" have a deep appreciation for their fanbase, and it's clear that the movie was made with the utmost respect for the source material and its community. The attention to detail and the commitment to staying faithful to the game's lore demonstrate a rare level of dedication to the fanbase.In conclusion, ""Five Nights at Freddy's: The Movie"" is a masterpiece of horror cinema. It captures the essence of the game while expanding on its narrative, providing answers to long-standing mysteries, and introducing new elements that will keep fans talking for years to come. With its exceptional cast, masterful direction, and jaw-dropping visual effects, this film is nothing short of perfection. It's a must-see for fans of the franchise and a brilliant introduction for those new to the world of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.",2023-10-27
"I have been a fan of the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise for 9 years, and I can say that this was a good adaptation for the video game. I give it 3.5 stars or 7/10 because I have watched many interviews with Emma Tammi and some YouTubers were able to release BTS footage a week or so early. Those interviews and BTS videos really helped me understand the love and care Blumhouse, Scott Cawthon Productions, and Jim Henson's put into the world that they all knew so many loved. But I wouldn't go any higher than 3.5 or 7/10 because there were not that many jump scares or good scares. It got me a few times, but not as many as I wished for. And they didn't show much of William or the Spring Bonnie suit. William Afton is the villain of this franchise. In every universe FNaF has, there is a William, and he kills, and I feel like they swung and missed the ball with William a little. If they are able to make a second film, I hope they explore William more. This is a fun watch, good for fans of the franchise, and a good beginner movie for people who get too scared watching horror movies.",2023-10-28
"I really liked this film, I advise everyone to watch it.Everything related to the history of fnaf is shown in this film. Also, some details and events have been added. But this does not prevent the film from being very interesting. I'm really looking forward to the continuation of this film.I hope the film will pay off, since it has a very large budget of 25 million dollars.The actors in this film played well, the animatronics were made well and played their role well. So, we are really looking forward to the continuation of this film. Many thanks to Scott, that publishing house for that This movie was shot...",2023-10-27
"Let me get this out of the way- if you come to this movie wanting just some scary movie, you will be SORELY disappointed. The FNAF series as a whole is... well, the horror is more in the lore implications than in the jumpscares. They aren't the peak of horror, they never have been. Fans know this, though. This isn't the scariest game of all time, this is the most convoluted, and that's why we love it. This movie is 1 hr 50 min of LORE, CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, and FANSERVICE, and I loved every single minute of it. I've loved Five Nights at Freddy's for nearly a whole decade, and this movie was for kids like me who grew up on this series and love it for the convoluted disaster that it is. Even if you don't know the plot from the games, go into it with an open mind and a sense of humor. It's not a slasher, and it doesn't pretend to be. It is a love letter to fans. Thank you, Blumhouse. This movie was excellent.",2023-10-27
"Absolutely wonderful movie. I know a lot of people are disappointed about the lack of ""jump scares"" or overall sad about how it's not super scary. Though it could have been good to add in, I don't feel like it was super necessary. The way it is all put together makes it flow very well. The sounds, and characters, and the overall plot. *Spoiler** Also, I know some were also disappointed about William Afton saying ""I always come back"" in such a rushed way, but I think it fit well. It is the actors own interpretation, not to mention the fact that his lungs were being crushed by the spring locks, so he had to speak fast. I also like that the puppet was shown in the background with chica, leaving room for new theories or ideas. One critique I do have though is how the aunt died. I was there was slightly more closure on that or what happened afterward, or make her death more interesting. *End Spoiler** Overall, the movie was really good and incorporated everything well and it didn't feel rushed at all.",2023-11-01
"I am no where near a movie critic so this is just me talking about the movie and a random young adult viewer. No it's technically not a super good movie but I loved it. It was so fun to watch and pick out different Easter eggs through the movie all about different peices of the lore. The beginning was a little confusing but the end was amazing. I am a massive Mathew Lillard fan so of course that helps my rating but he did such a good job and litterallyy screamed with excitedment while watching some of his scenes. Also, the anamatronics were absolutly incredible. Finally there us no ""we are FNAF"" or anything like that. I would recommend it to anyone who loves FNAF.",2023-10-27
"My expectations for this movie were low, and I now believe that was a good thing, as I feel like it saved me a lot of disappointment. I'll discuss my biggest problems with the movie before saying what I liked.First of all, the atmosphere: the movie isn't scary. At all. The horror of ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" has always been loud noises and fast images appearing on your screen. Not adding jump scares to the movie meant getting rid of the only means the franchise has of creating fear, and as such, there wasn't a single moment during my viewing of this movie where I felt scared or uneasy. The random, unnecessary moments of comedy like Balloon Boy's creepy figurine or Golden Freddy getting into a taxi, as well as the animatronics' overly pristine, shiny, and colorful appearance, Matpat's terrible, TERRIBLE cameo, as well as the inclusion of the original song made by The Living Tombstone, don't help in the slightest in this regard, either.Secondly, the pacing. The movie feels too dragged out and slow. The first half hour is spent with the conflict between Mike and Aunt Petunia for the custody of Abby; this plotline, as well as Petunia's entire character, is completely unnecessary to the major story of the film and doesn't even expand our perspective of the main characters. Remove scenes with unnecessary characters like Max, her brother, and Petunia, and the movie sits around an hour and twenty minutes, more than enough time for the story it tells.However, there were also many things I enjoyed about the movie. For example, I liked how its story strayed away from that of the games, as it allowed the film to tell an actually interesting and understandable story. I also loved what they did to Vanessa's character, turning her from the mediocre and forgettable villain from the games into an interesting, sympathetic, and tragic hero. Her relationship with Michael Afton was also an unexpected and, frankly, incredible twist that I hope will be explored further in the sequels. Speaking of him, while the plot twist of Steve Raglan being Afton was obvious from the moment the first trailer was released, it was entertaining nonetheless. Mike's and Abby's relationship was heartwarming, and the movie actually made me feel and care for them.Overall, this movie is, to me, one of those films that do their job to entertain while not providing anything worth analyzing or fixating on, which isn't a bad thing in and of itself. I actually think the best way to watch it would be if you haven't touched or read a single piece of media related to FNAF in your life. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is looking for a scary or plot-heavy movie.",2023-11-01
"When a beloved horror computer game is adapted into a film, it's natural to be apprehensive about the result. Unfortunately for this film, these instincts were valid in my experience, as for 114 minutes I was expected to endure a messy, childish rendition of what is far from a children's franchise.Matthew Lillard carried the acting for most of the film despite only appearing in two scenes. In general, this was yet another letdown from tinsel-town, as appears to be the norm post-2019.I will pay substantial money to see a reboot in the future - with James Wan directing and perhaps Spielberg or kin assisting Cawthon with re-writing. A last point or suggestion is to raise the target audience's age a tad to accommodate more mature story-telling and scares in line with the source material.",2023-10-28
"The acting was brilliant and the robots were well made. However, I feel that the charecters could have had more effort put into them and more stuff added to the horror element. But if you're just getting into the horror genre I feel that this would be a good starting point. The sets were very well made and the acting was also very well done.Overall, it was a pretty good adaptation of the game considering that the game itself was a very simple concept. If you haven't played the game I still believe that you could find some enjoyment out of it since there are plot lines outside of just the Pizzaria.",2023-10-27
"Fnaf the movie has a lot of easter eggs spread throught ever since the very beggining until when the credits are rolling. What could have brought critics to drag this movie throught mud was the lack of huge horror but as a fan that has been waiting YEARS for this moment to arrive, i am not quite that mad that what scared me the most was the jumpscares of balloon boy. It isnt only based on the games, we also have the books to look into, and we cannot ignore that it is children souls inside those animatronics. This cast choice was incredible, The soundtrack choice by the end was so surprising, i spent the whole time smiling and like i had younger me sat right there having the time of their life. Dont listen to the critics, Go watch the movie and take your own thoughts about it.",2023-11-01
"I was really excited to see this movie and did take into consideration how bad the critic reviews were when buying my ticket to watch it but I still decided to give it a chance and honestly wish i didn't...the gore was like a 1/10 which I'm not saying that the entire reason i watched the movie was for gore but when i tell you there's NOTHING, oh I mean it. Half of the deaths were off screen, the animatronics looked like they were created with a budget consisting of monopoly money, the plot made me feel like i was watching a Tubi Original and on top of that the springtrap scene everyone hyped up was so underwhelming and boring. If I'm being quite honest it just looked like William fell on the floor and couldn't get up because his hip was bad or something. If you're a die heart fan who's been hyping yourself up for 6 months waiting for this movie to release than yeah maybe you'll enjoy this, but if you're the average fan who's looking for a decent movie adaptation of FNAF and its lore with a side of a couple good scares then this movie is not the one for you. Save your money folks.",2023-10-28
"I honestly had high expectations for this movie, because of its lore and concept. And because it's Scott Cawthon! The OG who made bloody horror and thrilling FNAF franchise. So after watching it, I was kind of disappointed. Was it enjoyable? Yes, I did enjoy it I won't lie. Was it good? No, and here's why.Don't get me wrong, some scenes in the movie were phenomenal and actors did a good job too. However, the biggest flaw of this movie is that it's not horror - there's no real thrill in it. When I saw that Scott Cawthon has done the screenplay/ is the producer, I expected bloody, claustrophobic, traumatizing and memorable horror. I prepared myself mentally for this. And what I got is a PG 13 ""horror"" that's so forgettable. They played this REALLY safe to appease the audience of children and that honestly sucks. The jumpscares felt weak. I did not feel uneasy and it sucks since this was supposed to be a horror movie! It sucks because they could have risked having the unforgettable and traumatizing piece of horror (and probably the best in the decade). For example, I'll take the first FNAF game as an example. It's still one of the best games because of its simplicity while creating a creepy atmosphere and tension at the same time. What they could have done is make the previous security guard about his struggles and anxiety while working there - how would he be like at the verge of death? How would he handle the lack of electricity and balancing the power consumption? (this would fit more with Mike but still!) Basically, what I'm saying is that they should have stick to what the game was really about (anticipation and dread and tension) instead of mixing the comedy elements into the movie which ruins it and automatically stops being a horror movie. Speaking of mixing, they do a lot of mixing in this movie!The plot feels bland and weak. There are lots of plot points that don't really make sense, like Mike trying to find out who kidnapped his brother and trying to keep Abby away from his aunt. He also dreams about other kids once he starts working at Pizzeria? And they are Abby's friends as well at the beginning for some reason? Also Mike kind of moves on from the fact that William Afton killed his brother? Like at the end the abduction of his brother doesn't matter anymore. What was the point of the abduction and missing children then? And the ending didn't make sense either.They also try to show FNAF 1's atmosphere at the beginning which is not bad but then they mix Springlock from FNAF 3 and Vanessa from the Security Breach. Another reason why the story is flawed. They try to mix games into one movie and it doesn't work especially because Scott Cawthon himself said that there's going to be a sequel. The ending doesn't leave much opening for the sequel. What I'd do is make the movie only about FNAF 1 then have sequels be in production.In short, I wouldn't recommend this movie if you're not a fan. It's enjoyable if you're a fan. In general, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone and I think the only saving grace for this movie of making money is its roots and fanservice, since it's hitting the box office currently. I bet everyone would forget this movie in a month or so.",2023-11-01
"If your a total fnaf nerd like me you will love this movie all the cameos Easter eggs and references a
Will make you the happiest person in the world if your a fan if your not then the story could be messy and confusing for you and you won't get anything just if your a fan don't listen to the critics and watch it for yourself it's also on peacock for people who want to watch it in their own comfort and room. Overall great for fans but will be confusing for new fans and non fans, you should give the franchise a chance and play the games then you will under it and live it but hey that's not just a theory that's a game theory.",2023-10-26
"In my opinion this movie is great and yes It isn't exactly like the game, but of course it wouldn't be exactly like the game, the game is extremely simple, especially the 1st game you just look at the cameras and close the doors!! I think they carried out the lore very well, the actors did a great job, and of course the design and atmosphere was fantastic. It wasn't too scary, but some moments could give you chills and the movie had the right amount of gore in it as well. I 100% recommended watching this film especially FNAF fans (It was a few significant cameos and easter eggs) 9/10 almost 10/10.",2023-10-28
"This movie is definitely designed for the fans. For someone like me with Fandom brainrot I found it easy to love the movie with all the lore dumping.The cameos and Easter eggs were especially good eats (even moreso if you love a good theory ;) )I can see why critics or anybody not familiar with the franchise would find this movie confusing or a lot. However, to my knowledge, it has been stated that this movie was made for the fans in mind. And it did not disappoint me in the slightest. I haven't felt this happy nostalgia in so long. It awakened my teen self whom used to be so full of excitement. Worth the watch if you're a fan!",2023-10-27
"I loved this move (too much), everything was perfect!! The acting, the shots and angles, the sound design was amazing too, the jumpscares got me sometimes. I just loved this movie, I think it was totally worth the 8 year long wait. Only small issue I had was the pacing, could've been done a bit better but still amazing!!I also think they nailed everything while the movie being rated PG-13, even if the movie was rated R it would just show more gore. But FNAF itself isn't really known for its gore but rather sound design, lore and some other stuff.I think it deserves the 9/10 rating and you don't have to agree with me if you don't feel like it!!",2023-10-27
"I have been waiting on this film for the better half of eight years and found this to be a very rewarding experience in the lore aspect. The jumpscares and the horror elements were quite lackluster even though the team along with Cawthon did an incredible job. The story never stays in one place, and the characters do not have much depth to their personality. Matthew Lillard on the other hand, did an amazing job as the titular villain, William Afton. His line deliveries and facial expressions were on point, especially the ""What have you done"" quote. As a lore aficionado, my dreams came true with the many 'deeper dives' into the Pizzeria's backstory, but the (central plot = not there) just did it in for me. Hopefully the 2 others yet to come will be just as good if not better.",2023-10-31
"I'm a huge FNAF fan, I've been following the series since the first game in 2014, and since the lore of the franchise goes so deep and complex, I was really hoping for some callbacks, clearing up some misconceptions maybe, even something like the Silver Eyes novels, set in a different universe but still adding to the game's stories through small details and clarifications. This movie has none of that.Honestly, I think this would have been a MUCH better movie, both for long-time fans and for newcomers, if it stuck closer to the story of the games. There are so many moments that I was convinced were setting up for one of the plot points in the game, like Vanessa's knowledge of Freddy's, and how weird she acted when asked about Mike's brother, which I was certain would lead back to how she gets brainwashed by the antagonist in the games, but turned out to just be a case of iffy acting and a plot twist that just serves to contradict the games even further.If you're a FNAF fan looking for a movie to clarify the lore, or even to demonstrate a basic understanding of it, I would recommend looking to fanmade projects to satisfy that want. This is a good movie, but a bad Five Nights at Freddy's movie.Pros: very good atmosphere, Josh Hutcherson eye candy, impressive animatronics, might be a good base for some fanfiction writers.Cons: convoluted disconnected and inaccurate story, iffy child acting, understanding of the lore at the same level as someone who watched a game theory video 8 years ago and was just asked to recall every detail (which is odd considering the literal creator of the first 8 or so games worked on this movie.)",2023-10-27
"This is a movie for the og fnaf fans and im happy that they decided to follow the books. I couldn't give it 10 tho and that's just because it wouldn't be appealing to the average viewer who isn't already a fan. There isn't much for horror so that detracted a bit too (if you want a thrill, even tho it's fanmade, there is some great vhs horror made by fans on youtube). There is a bit of cheesiness, so don't expect it to be a serious thriller with constant scares and edge of hour seat watching. It's a love letter to the franchise. I loved the set building, I liked the backstory of the main character I find it entangled him into the happenings of Freddy's pretty well. The sound design was lovely as well. This will definitely be a movie I watch again.",2023-11-02
"Most people seem upset that the film wasn't darker and rated R, but might I remind you that the source material for this movie (which is based off the first game) barely had gore! The game was also teen so PG-13 would be appropriate! Keep in mind that not every horror movie has to be extremely gruesome, raw and brutal. The Ring is considered one of the best of all time and it barely has blood shed.Though the cinematography isn't world shattering, the story is lose and has some continuity errors, it's fully made up with the animatronics, gore (which there is a surprising amount for a PG-13 movie),cameos, and set designs! Some rooms are 1 to 1 compared to the ones in the video games and I found myself searching the background for little Easter eggs hidden on set(I was not disappointed). The soundtrack is beautifully made, and perfectly adds suspense to the movie! Many fans going in looking for a movie as scary as Hereditary will be disappointed, this is more creepy than scary itself! There are a few jumpscares that mimic the game perfectly!This is a love letter to FNAF. Lovingly crafted for parents to watch while your child screams at the lore implications behind the blanket pattern!",2023-10-27
"Absolutely incredible, exactly what I expected and more. As a long term fan this met all of my expectations in both the marketing approach and the film.I wish W. Afton's lines had been moved a bit, some were a bit awkwardly timed, but aside from that Lillard's performance was incredibly done. He teased the identity reveal well with his timing and expressions and really leaned into the fact that William is just an abusive man, not necessarily a mastermind. For me, that depiction was incredibly creepy and fit well with the themes.Hutcherson did insanely well as Mike, his ability to show when a character is deliberately hiding an emotion without overdoing it works so well for this role. His chemistry with Rubio cannot be overstated. I wish Mike was less invincible, but he is the protagonist so it can slide. The way that Hutcherson can do so much with just his tone of voice really grounded a lot of the dream sequences where motion felt uncontrolled or unpredictable, which lent a lot of weight when the other characters finally spoke back.Rubio as Abby was amazing. She paralleled the crying child so well and her ability to convince the audience that these animatronics and toys were truly her friends was awesome. The use of food in her arc and the way she could display her feelings through actions (rather than just tone or her lines) made her arc so much more convincing. There were moments where you could tell she was acting, particularly when she is meant to be scared or in suspense, but nothing noticeable enough to pull you out of the movie. For a child actor in a leading role she did insanely well.Lail did well as Vanessa. She really nails the adult-playing-with-children scenes and was incredible at showing when Vanessa was pretending not to be scared. There were times unfortunately where the script did the heavy lifting in terms of showing that she had a history with Freddy's and her emotional connections with the place and her family. She didn't always act like she had an emotional motive to be there, it was the words she said that told us rather than her showing us how she was feeling. This came across particularly strongly when she was discussing her history with the restaurant and how her family was affected by it, which made the scenes less emotional and more like a lore-dump, which is something I was hoping to avoid a bit more. Aside from those moments she did well to play into the tension of her role and the competing forces that the character is balancing.The kids playing the MCI victims were incredible, especially the child playing Cassidy. The ability to seem intimidating, manipulative, and vaguely amused/pleased without overdoing it or coming off as comedic is a challenge and a half, but he pulled it off so insanely well. Wish we saw more of the other kids, I hope they get to play more of a role in the next movie.Major kudos to the actors, technicians, and puppeteers who made the animatronics come to life. You could really feel their weight in their movement and it made them far more intimidating. There were definitely limitations in what was possible, and sometimes that made it feel stilted, but the way the animatronics managed to so clearly display emotion and communicate to each other made up for it.The sets were easily one of the best parts of this film, and I cannot overstate that. The physicality they create, the depth of the space and detail was incredibly immersive. The way they use the sets creatively to show what people are hiding and how, the way they use it as an active prop rather than just a place to be, the way that they mirror the games, it all makes for an incredible sense of space and character for the whole world and the people in it.The way they appealed to fans in so many moments hit well for me. I won't spoil anything, but it was incredible.In terms of tone I do wish there was more tension. It may have been the screening I was at, but I didn't feel the tense fear the games are known for. I didn't mind the lack of graphic violence, that honestly made it scarier for me as you can imagine what happens far more graphically than anything you get shown. Additionally, none of the games have particularly graphic violence or gore, it is all 8-bit or implied. I do wish that the potential for how graphic stuffing people into the suits can be was teased or explored more, that the animatronics had blood stains/hand prints on them or that we saw hair tangled around parts of an endoskeleton, something to show that they weren't shying away from it, that it was more intentional. I did love the use of more classic Saw-esque traps and how they were depicted, but again they only hint at what they can do and leave you to imagine the rest. It came across as a slasher at times, but the series really benefits more from being psychological horror when aiming for that fear factor.The editing was very well done. The audio was immersive and added to the emotion of the scenes. The timing of cuts and style of transitions did well with the established rules of what a FNAF creation should look and feel like, and played well with the tropes we know and love. The use of lighting, colour, and audio really helped sell a lot of the haunting, and although practical props can do that well, the level of refinement and care that has gone into editing those moments pays off. My only complaint was that at times the dialogue was either too loud or too quiet in comparison to the soundtrack and diegetic noise, which made some emotional beats hit less intensely than I would've wanted.I am happy with how they have left the ending as being open for a sequel based on either the second game or a new story entirely. I would love to see a sequel using the dream-theory (a wonderful double meaning there, good job Cawthon and Tammi) to show the past of Freddy's in 1983-87 with the MCI and the bites from Vanessa's perspective (Skinamarink style coma dream maybe), possibly with more of her backstory and depiction of W. Afton as an abuser. It would also be nice if that explained some of W. Afton's motives. Potentially this could be inter-cut with a FNAF 2 or 3 style movie where Mike is guarding whatever location is depicted next to continue his and Abby's story.Overall, this movie was exactly what fans wanted and needed it to be. It isn't perfect, but that means sequels will be set up for success without as much comparison. Excited for more, and I hope it doesn't take 8 years this time (though I would watch it even if it did).",2023-10-27
"As someone who just watched the movie today (came out in cinemas in aus today) not knowing anything about the video game or anything about it it was an interesting movie, there was a nice story to it which added emotion and drama. Walking in blind with only a friend saying it was a horror i was unsure what to expect. I dont thinj id classify it as horror, it wasnt scary, there was a small amount of gore and a bit of blood but not as much as i was expecting. Josh hutcherson played his role amazingly, i don't think ive seen him in any movies since the hunger games, (which i had just watched a marathon 2 days ago). Pretty happy with the acting, im unsure how i felt about the animatronics, i was hoping theyd be a bit more scary. Overall not bad movie, was enjoyable, it was interesting. (Btw , first reviewer whoop)",2023-10-26
"I've been an FNAF fan since 2016 and seriously with game theory and coryxkenshin as my favorite youtubers I'm a bit biased but still it is great. The spring lock scene was a bit unlike how it should have been but still great. And I didn't like the change from Mike being afton's son. And the sparky references were a little too much like just the animatronic suit would have been good enough. And I'll give the golden chainsaw to Max's death I mean the chomp in half was great. And I will give the dull machete to the unamed security guard, seriously off screen and no blood papa no likey. FNAF was a epic movie but could use a little bit of work.",2023-10-27
"It's good but could be better. Loved the amount of references to the games. Like the motor raceway and the original jump scare sound. The runtime was good nothing felt rushed, it all worked out well in the end for me. I personally think that the I always come back line was forced for a gag, because of somthing that happens in the game's about William Afton coming back from the dead. The character design was really well done with the animatronics looking really clean. I loved the inclusion of Matpat as a diner waiter and Cory Kenshin as a taxi driver as teased in the trailers for this movie. All in all a great movie for the family.",2023-10-28
"It could have been better if it was accurate to the game lore (might be theories but im pretty sure most of it is actually verified to be true.)
First of all, where's Elizabeth Afton and the crying child? Who the hell are abby and the other kid (mikes wannabe brother)? Why was Vanessa Williams child when Mike, Elizabeth and CC should be? Why the hell did William die there like that? Why didn't he go try and destroy the robots? And the human characters except vanessa all looked to different to what I imagined/the mini games. Overall the animatronics were great in build and the pizzeria looked pretty accurate, but like there wasnt even a single clip of mike actually doing the security job like in the first game and the movie was supposed to be horror but it really wasn't. Age limit should be lowered too. I don't think it was worth the years of wait for this, and I hope someone else will make a new version of a fnaf movie, which would be more accurate to the lore. Thank you for reading, 4/10.",2023-10-27
"This film adaptation was seriously everything that I as a child ever dreamed of and more! It was so satisfying to see my favorite characters move and my favorite scenes play out before me on the big screen. To see the man from channels I'm obsessed with, Matpat, filled me with immense joy!I am so satisfied with the film and pleased with the cast, I don't think anyone could have done better. So many satisfying Easter Eggs for the longtime-fan and a genuinely incapsulating story-line for the average viewer.As someone who had their hopes set lowly by reviews, I am pleased to say that this movie was one of my favorites, and I will be watching again!",2023-10-29
"Five nights at Freddy's is a strange combination of elements. On one side, you have a cast of pretty cool and terrifying characters, in a location that's familiar to many adults and with a pretty gruesome backstory. But on the other side, you have the fans and audience of said cast, location and backstory mostly consisting of youths. What do you then do as a director, or a script writer? Well you compromise.I have no doubt this movie would be pretty good, if not great, if it had truly committed to its adult audience, but It was never gonna do that and thus, this movie was never going to be any good. I went in knowing this, and I was still baffled by how terrible the story was.The production quality in regards to the set and the animatronics though were through the roof, and that alone definitely made the movie worth the watch. So if you're solely into that kind of stuff, and are able to ignore the plot, I definitely recommend this movie to you.",2023-11-02
I saw the five nights at Freddy's movie this Saturday and oh my lord this movie is incredible now I know the plot might not make perfect sense for some others and the movie might be not scary but more goofy. But that's ok this movie was made for fans and Scott said he'd change things for the sequel. This movie has good scares good plot and even better lore. This movie made me feel like a kid again and I would recommend this movie for any five nights at Freddy's fan new or even older. Good movie good acting good cast good soundtrack and good story overall. My official rating is a huge amazing 10/10.,2023-11-01
"As a fan of the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise, I eagerly anticipated the release of its film adaptation. However, after watching the movie, I can't help but feel disappointed with how it turned out. While it isn't entirely devoid of merit, I can only give it 5 out of 10 stars due to missed opportunities.One glaring issue I have is the film's failure to take risks with its portrayal of gore. Five Nights at Freddy's has a reputation for its dark and gruesome themes, and the movie had the potential to deliver terrifying and horrifying moments. Unfortunately, it played it safe, shying away from exploring the full extent of the visceral horror that the game franchise is known for. This decision robs the film of its potential impact and fails to fully capture the essence of the source material.Moreover, the movie felt a bit rushed in some aspects, the hasty execution affected the overall coherence of the film's plot. The story felt disjointed and lacking in a clear and logical progression. The opportunity for a deeper exploration of the lore was squandered, leaving the film feeling hollow and unsatisfying for fans hoping for a more robust narrative.While I understand the desire to appeal to a wider audience, the result was a diluted adaptation that fails to fully satisfy the image that is Five Nights At Freddy's. The film's lack of ambition in embracing the horror and gore elements, combined with a rushed-appearing execution, left me wanting more and feeling somewhat let down.In conclusion, the Five Nights at Freddy's movie disappointingly played it safe, failing to take the necessary risks to truly capture the essence of the game franchise. The reluctance to fully explore the dark and gruesome aspects of the story, hindered the film's potential. As a fan, I had expected more and left the theater feeling unsatisfied.",2023-10-29
"A great movie for a FNAF fan! There will never be enough time for your eyes to become sated of the fabulous designs of animatronics, restaurant itself, including all of its interiors: furniture, kids drawings, lights and many other little details.During all of the runtime you will be pleased by means and ways creators came up to embody all in-game nuances in a motion picture.Also take into account a decent soundtrack: calm gray tracks, bringing grayish-everyday-type of mood, followed by high-pitched pieces to bring horror and concluded with several licensed songs that lightens the moment (and the stage); well done visuals even apart all game-related stuff and a decent story - that all together makes this movie a total blast: absolute must see for some people and worth watching for others!",2023-10-29
As a Five Night at Freddy's lorehead I can say aside from two or three moments (mainly the weird sawblade face contraption and the inaccuracy around the springlocks) it is quite faithful to the lore. However as a movie with a coherent story it falls flat. The story of the game is well adapted but any character stories worked in are left unresolved or just forgotten midway through. The poor usage of Afton himself is disappointing but understandable. They tried to much with telling the audience why to care rather then just showing us a reason on screen. A decent sequel could so some good to fix this though. All that being said as a FNaF fan I would rewatch if I didn't have to pay perhaps on a steaming service.,2023-10-27
"I went and saw the fnaf movie with a few of my friends and we all enjoyed it so much. The cameos of famous fnaf youtubers were so exciting to see and the theatre was in an uproar with big reveals and cameos were on screen.The visual aspect of the movie was beautiful. The film was just a nice movie to look at. It still puts a smile on my face to know Blumhouse made the animatronics instead of using CGI. They looked absolutely amazing. The camera angles and way it was filmed was just so effective and it made the movie a very nice movie to watch and appreciate for it's beautiful aspect.The storytelling, on the other hand, I feel needed work. The thing about the storyline in this movie is that it was kind of everywhere. There were like 3 moments of extreme thrill just becayse the climax itself wasn't as dramatic and emphasized, and I would have liked to have seen it that way. Yes, it was still a very thrilling peak of the movie, but there was little to no build, nor was it objectively and visually that different from the other spikes of thrill and suspense in the earlier scenes in the movie.Though the storytelling needed working, it was still a very good story to tell. It was still effective and made me feel the suspense, thrill, and shock that a horror movie is intended to instill in its audience. It was even more thrilling because of foreknowledge to the story and plot of the franchise of FNAF itself and seeing big plot hole reveals to the former knowledge FNAF fans had! I can't wait to see MatPat theories on the Game Theorists sometimes verryyy soon because the movie was effective enough to have big lore drops that can be investigated.Overall, this movie was great. I enjoyed it so much with my friends. I congratulate Blumhouse for such a successful and amazing film!! When the eventual second movie comes out (from the implications of that cliffhanger at the end), I WILL be going to see it and be sliding my money for overpriced tickets again :)",2023-10-28
"!! POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!!I'm a huge FNAF fan, I love the games and the lore and the books. I was really excited for this movie to come out and honestly it was really good.My issue with it is that it follows lore very loosely, so any hardcore fans might be a bit disappointed. I don't want to spoil it but key events that happen in-game aren't in the film, except for maybe 2 or 3.I want to say that it's obvious that Blumhouse put a lot of effort in to making FNAF something watchable, I just wish there was a bit more gore-y fear factor.As someone who grew up with the fan-made movies and lore recaps, this movie doesn't really meet my underlying expectations, but as a standalone film, it is near perfect.The animatronics though are where the film faults again. There's rarely any time that they scared me, which is a bit upsetting considering the gore-y lore aspects of the game. I understand that translating video games into movies is hard, but still, I want to be scared by something as hyped as this.Knowing that Scott Cawthon worked on this film makes me feel like he's ground up almost all major key points of the lore and turned it to a film from perspective of the night guard, but leaves out the intensely traumatic events of the game which so many fans are ecstatic to see.",2023-10-26
"I watched this twice, as someone who's been waiting for this for years and went through multiple fake movie announcements and fan made trailers throughout the years I am happy that this is what we waited for.I'm gonna go through it piece by piece. The intro: absolutely amazing, I loved the theme music and the game intro, the theme music itself might be one of my favourite things about the film.The scene in the beginning with the old security guard being chased, it was a pretty good way to start the movie.Mike was played amazingly, great character, Abby was a bit irritating at times but realistically so for a child character, in general she was pretty good and definitely important for the film. Vanessa was an interesting add to the film, again not a bad character at all although the twist of her being Michael Afton's daughter was somewhat predictable.Overall great choice of actors/actresses, everyone did great and looked amazing, everyone fit the style of the film.The best part about the entire movie is absolutely the character design, the design of the pizzeria and THE ANIMATRONICS!! The animatronics were everything anyone could have hoped for, they looked absolutely perfect, exactly what I'd hope they'd be like. I have a soft spot for movies that have real props and robotics (like the original Jurassic park) so this movie absolutely delivered with their costumes, couldn't have been any better.As a big fan of Jim Henson, especially Dinosaurs and Labyrinth, it was so exciting to hear that the Jim Henson Company assisted with the creation of the puppets/animatronics.The attention to details keeps you on your toes the entire time, I was so excited when I saw ""it's me"" written on the mirror, as well as the plushies hidden around the set. The celebrate poster was so awesome to see, the characters showing up in their famous areas in the games (foxy in the hallway, Bonnie in the cupboard, chica in the kitchen)Now the first time I watched it I didn't like the fort scene at all, I hated that they were nice with Abby like that but after they tried to make her ""like them"" it all made perfect sense, it's easy to forget that they are children on the inside, this scene brings that to light. The second time watching it everything came together and felt perfect.As an older fan I would have loved more horror scenes/more gore but I also understand why it wasn't scary. It will be a first horror movie for many kids and teenagers out there.Balloon boy brought a bit of fun and humour into the story, I think the final jumpscare in the taxi got everyone in the cinema (although I wasn't expecting him to be so small)I loved how Vanessa and Mike didn't end up in a relationship, it wasn't needed for the movie and it would have taken attention away from the plot, although they've left the ending nice and open so there's a possibility in the possible sequel of them being together OR Vanessa not making it out of the hospital at all.The spring lock scene was not as gorey as I'd always imagined it but then again made sense for reasons I've stated above, and was still a satisfying scene.All in all 8/10, I loved it.",2023-10-30
"There are so many deep cuts in this film that just showed that they made this for people who are fans of the franchise. And since I've been a fan since 2015 it really spoke to me. It's a poorly made movie that I had such a good time watching that I can overlook all of its flaws. I'll talk about some of those flaws though, the fort building scene really hammers in how this is barely a horror movie, it's not truly scary and fails I'm anything outside of Balloon Boy Figurine jump scares (which to be fair, jump scares are the main scare of FNAF). There was also a definite pacing problem, some of the scenes towards the beginning could've been cut or shortened to lengthen the all too brief climax. Another issue with the film is its propensity to leave plot threads unwound, where did Golden Freddy go? There is no answer. What happened to the aunts body? Unclear. But with all that said this movie has sparky the dog in it, an animatronic notorious in the fan base for never actually being real. He was a hoax that they put in the background as an incredible Easter egg. This movie is not good, but I completely adore it and I desperately want more.",2023-10-29
"I know the Five Nights at Freddy's games and all the stories and theories by heart.To be honest, adapting a game with so many scenarios and so many stories and theories into a 2-hour movie will definitely not be easy.Honestly, I loved the animatronics, it was very realistic. Especially the balloon boy scenes were extremely good. The fazberia space and the darkness of the space was very good.As for the story (I'll talk spoilers here), the game deviated too much from the story and even the names were used differently (for example, shouldn't it be mike, the son of william afton?) (or even the name of mike's brother was used differently) (Like why is vanessa in security breach game so connected to the story? And why is william's daughter)Honestly, I'd like to see Abby in the circus baby. Also sad that there is no puppet characterAnd as for springtrap, that has to be the only scene in the movie with a realistic story.Also, the message at the end of the movie, ""Come find me"" was a bit creepy.After more than 10 years of waiting for Five Nights at Freddy's, the movie failed for me in terms of story absurdity.",2023-10-29
"Just got home after watching Five Nights at Freddy's at the cinema and I am glad to say I had a fun time. The movie wasn't too saturated with Easter eggs and cameos, but did sprinkle them throughout, giving the movie space to breathe and it's plot room to grow. Although the reveal of spring trap could have had more buildup, the movie was enjoyable and a pleasant experience, while also expanding the franchise. To sum up, the movie was great, acting was good, plot was unexpected, but interesting, and the special effects and practical effects were great, however, the ending could have been given a bit more breathing room, but altogether still good.",2023-10-28
"It was okay i thought mat pat wasnt gonna be in the movie i was surprised when he was actually there!, but in the middle of the movie it was poor of lore. They just did the MAIN lore of the story, and THEY played with the animatronics (like what?) but it was worth the wait i guess. Im a long life fan of fnaf so i guess it was a great movie. I LIKE THE INTRO SONG, and with the cherry on top the ""five nights at freddy's"" song in the post credits. I had a great time I LOVE IT. I do think they could've made it better, to dig in the LORE'S Like ""why did william build the restaurant?"" and Where are the doors tho.",2023-10-29
"This is definitely a movie for the gen Z!! Only fans would get it, so read up on before you watch! Loved it so much cant get enough. Im giving it full ratings because you can only do so much with these robots and it's amazing how they did it! I want to watch it again with another group of friends!! Knowing the lore and seeing how it came to life cured my 2014 self. Everyone did the best with this insane project. Also the plot twists are crazy!!!!!! Please check out this movie if you are a diehard fan it was very interesting to see this and I LOVED seeing my favorite fnaf youtubers in it!!! I hope you check it out.",2023-10-28
"For fnaf fans especially, it was an amazing time, with cameos and easter eggs, everyone who knew fnaf definitely had an incredible time. But for horror fans, i dont think they wouldve enjoyed this movie as much as fans of the game franchise. It was amazing but a part of me wishes it was more gory and more jumpscare induced. But i understand as a lot of the fnaf base is children, they didnt want to make a lot of people miss out. I hope they make it better for horror fand if they do another movie (i hope). But my time was incredible and i could rewatch this movie over and over again, it was astonishing.",2023-10-28
"I was expecting a full-fledged solid horror that delivered the breathtaking suspense I experienced when playing the free version of a FNAF 3. However, this movie failed to deliver.In the first half, it does kinda delivered that suspense like in the game, but after that, it's more like a mystery. I assume there's probably easter eggs or call backs to the lore. If there was, I completely missed it because I'm not familiar with the lore.In short, I was expecting a survival-of-the-night horror, going on for 5 nights. But this wasn't that movie. Willy's Wonderland felt more like the FNAF game than this one. Maybe if I'm familiar with the lore, I might see something different.Also, what happened to the theme that plays when the power is out?",2023-10-30
"Movies like this make me wonder who let a movie with such potential release like this? The movie is fun to watch, but the story is full of holes and the characters feel either forced or shallow.The movie combines parts from all the games, to create a unique timeline, but doesn't manage to add anything meaninfull to the story. The story was intentionally left vague in the first game. That was what made it interesting, but now Vanessa is here to feed you the story with a spoon, in case you couldn't get it. Why is she here? She literally just tells you the story and gets stabbed.I'm super annoyed with the movie, because i really wanted it to be better, but it has it's moments, and is entertaining to watch, apart from the bad ending.",2023-10-28
"The film has a cohesive story, well tied together in terms of the script. Managing to be a coherent film when telling the story presented, as the characters have an absurd layer to develop. The film does a lot of service to the fans, making several references to the games, making it a great treat for fanatics! The film does not have absurd horror, but it has some jumpscares that help make the scenes more tense. A very positive point for the film is the actor Matthew Lilard, playing Willian Afton, who is simply perfect and absurd for the role. Anyway, I say it's worth the experience, a fun film, with a good story, and great characters!",2023-10-30
"Wow. After so many years it's finally here! Usually when people try to make a movie based on a game they tend to make it boring, but it doesn't apply to this movie.As a person with a short attention span i find it hard to focus on what's going on in movies, I tend to get bored.But! I couldn't get my eyes off the screen, it felt like I was glued to the screen, as if I was playing five nights at Freddy's for the first time again. As if I was 14 again!This movie didn't feel like it was almost 2 hours long instead it felt like it was like it was too short, making me to crave for more - which means the actors and everyone who was involved with the production did what they needed to do!Yeah, this movie may not be as scary or as gory as some may expect...but it was still great!If you are or if you were (back in your younger years) a fan you'll definitely like the movie.Thanks to everyone who created the movie it made me feel like I was a teenager again, it felt good.Thank you.",2023-10-28
Honestly a really great and fun experience only 3 complaints 1. This film is not scary like at all they really should have focused more on animatronics trying to kill mike and him trying to defend himself from them a little more than dream lore 2. The plot with Vanessa is pretty bad like they just drop her reveal of her being William afton s daughter out of no where and it doesn't make much sense 3. NOT ENOUGH AFTON like honestly he is the main villain of the film and franchise should have been in it longer but when he is in it amazing😍 also his spring lock scene is amazing. Other than that tho this film is amazing and really is a love letter to fnaf fans out there great job Scott and Blumhouse 7/10 well better end this review was way longer than I thought it would be 😂😂 well all I can say is SEQUEL NOW !!,2023-10-29
"This movie was hella good and so over hated, like it goes over a lot of the lore and lines up with it. I also think that it was beautifully put together and well thought out. Probably one of the most hyped and anticipated films of all time, and it served well. Down to the smallest details and everything, it is truly hard to put in to words how amazing and beautiful this movie is. It will probably be the most watched movie for me for a long time, I will be able to recite this entire 2 hour movie word for word in a few weeks. Again this is the most anticipated movies of all time and it was well delivered. If you haven't watched it yet please do so.Thank you for reading.",2023-10-31
"I have been a fan of the five nights at Freddy's franchise for about 7 years, the movie was my biggest anticipation, since the movie was confirmed by a teaser trailer, I kept looking for leaks because I have been waiting for so long.I was expecting something far worse, I thought the movie was going to be like those fan-made movies you see on YouTube, some people expect it to be a Oscar-winning movie, and that's their problem, they are over expecting for the movie and if one thing doesn't come to their expectations, they will dislike the movie, and to the people who are mad because it's ""not scary enough"" or ""why is it not R rated"", most of the five nights at Freddy's fan base is young, it wouldn't make as much money, and leave a lot of fans devastated, and now for the people who say ""it isn't horror"", of course it isn't, what do you expect from a pg13? ""The movie is oddly paced,"" the plot is confusing"", the movie is perfectly paced, it's just the action that is short but no rushed, but that's still ok, the plot of five nights at Freddy's is known to be confusing, you think you know what's going on and the next game you'll be rethinking the entire plot again, so obviously the same thing is going to happen to the movie. Now I'll talk about my experience about the movie.I got into this movie a bit hopeless seeing all the negative reviews saying it's bloodless, 1 minute of screen time for the animatronics, blah blah blah, the movie had a very good amount of blood for a pg13, and five nights at Freddy's isn't known for being gorey,""but the books are gorey"" maybe because the books are literal words and pictures, and the springlock scene in the games is literally just red pixels, this movie had an extremely realistic spring lock scene. The movie was worth the wait, the kills were thrilling, the plot twist got me on the edge of my seat, I knew the plot was going to be confusing, and I liked it. This is honestly the best movie I have ever seen, I am not over exaggerating, as a FNAF fan, I saw this movie twice and I'm still mind blown by the acting. Definitely go to this movie.",2023-10-31
"I've never really wrote proper reviews on IMDB so stick with me here, thanks!Had my expectations pretty low, I knew it was never gonna be the masterpiece that people were hyping it up to be but that managed to obvert my expectations (not in a good way!)
For the first 45 minutes I was really really enjoying it, Mike's storyline seemed interesting and when he got to the actual pizzeria it looked and felt really like the game. After that it went downhill. It felt like I was watching a kids film with a few gory moments, I'm not saying in order to make a good horror film you have the make it super gory but that barely even counted as a horror film.The glowing red eyes and the downturned eyebrows on the animatronics just made them look fake and forced. I didn't actually feel any fear for the characters except for when Mike was getting his leg bit by the cupcake and when he was trying to escape from the building. (Probably because in most other scenarios the animatronics are trying to kill the person they are attacking, so you know it's not gonna happen. But with a leg he could've gotten it bitten off and still had to struggle his way out of the pizzeria)They said it was ""made for fans"" but then took the most basic parts of the FNAF lore and made it into a movie, meaning the plot twists and plot developments were things that most people going to see the movie would already know.A new part they added was the character 'Vanessa' who in the games didn't appear until Security Breach. Now a lot of people didn't like that she was in the movie but it wouldn't necessarily have to be a bad choice if she wasn't literally useless and only there so he could learn information and have someone except himself to talk to, to pad out the movie. One of the main things she was there for was to give Mike more information on why the pizzeria closed down and about the missing kids, which I think he could've as easily figured out from an old newspaper lying around. Also the plot twist about her being William's daughter I called in the first 30 minutes.The aunt storyline aswell?? It was there to be a little conflict for the characters to be having in their personal lives but ended up really having no impact and the aunt being dead on the floor was probably funnier than it was intending to be.I get that with the fort building scene and all that they were trying to show that the animatronics are children inside and they don't actually want to hurt people. Though it makes it really awkward because, in the games at least, you are playing night by night, the nights getting harder as you progress. Now I'm not saying the movie HAD to stick to that of course because that would limit you but it felt so awkward how the animatronics (to us anyway) were shown as malicious and harmful at the start. Foxy standing outside of Mike's office in a haunting silhouette for example. Then a night or two later, the animatronics are fun and friendly, but then they turn evil again at the end??? So many movies do misdirection for the characters in the way that us, as the viewer, has more information than the protagonist and knows that these characters who are seemingly nice are going to end up as the antagonists. Yet in this movie it just felt like such an awkward pause, it was ""Five Nights At Freddy's"" Yet the threat only really happened on the last night.There's a reason I'm not giving it lower, because there genuinely were so many parts I did actually really enjoy and appreciate them putting in. I did find Mike's story compelling but when the main issue I'm having with the movie is the animatronics (the literal selling point of the movie) it does kind of ruin it doesn't it?I can say though that the animatronics looked so on point to the games.It was seriously such a mid movie, like it wasn't bad enough to be 'bad', it wasn't good enough to be 'good', it was just MID. If mid was a movie it would be this.Anyway those were just my thoughts, the main thing I took away from that movie was Josh Hutcherson being an amazing actor. 👍👍",2023-10-27
"Yeah, the movie's not super scary, but I don't care to be honest. We don't need another generic slasher horror movie, and Five Nights at Freddy's helps bring a bit more substance to the genre. We get legitimately emotional moments with the characters and some humor to lighten things up after tense moments. There wasn't a single time I was scared, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't have an awesome time watching this movie. Lots of small details and easter eggs, an original take on a familiar story, and overall a great movie. Some of the jokes didn't quite land, but the ones that did were executed very well.I recommend this movie to long-time fans, but newer fans might not care as much. After all, this is a movie with nearly a decade of hype backing it up.",2023-11-02
"Five Nights at Freddy's is a solid horror film with some genuinely suspenseful and scary moments. The film's atmosphere is excellent, with the dimly lit pizzeria and eerie animatronics creating a sense of dread and unease. The film also features some effective jump scares, which are sure to startle even the most seasoned horror fans.However, the film is not without its flaws. The plot is predictable and the characters are underdeveloped. Mike is a generic protagonist who is not particularly interesting or likable. The supporting cast is also fairly forgettable, with the exception of Matthew Lillard, who gives a hammy but fun performance as Mike's career counselor.Overall, Five Nights at Freddy's is a decent horror film that is sure to please fans of the video game series. However, viewers looking for a more complex or character-driven horror film may be disappointed.",2023-11-01
"The movie was really good. They had some parts, the aunt, they could have done without and maybe add more of the animatronics or maybe more to explain the history of FNAF. But it was still good once they spend more time in the pizza place.I enjoyed some of the humor with the animatronics on stage playing music that was not the cheesy theme music most Pizza place animatronics had back in the 80s. So unless you were a 70s/80s child who was introduced to Chucky Cheese and animatronics, that may not be as nostalgic to you as it was for me.So it is PG13 and it was so great. It didn't have unnecessary sex scene la or cursing for no reason at all, but it does have killing. It was really cool to finally see how these things work and I now understand more of what my daughter talked about for over 8 years. Haha.It was really cool and worth seeing in theaters before watching on Peacock. Then you can go home and watch for Easter eggs after. But pay close attention to detail. It has so so much in such a short film. If you blink, you will miss so much.Good job Blumhouse for making such a cool film. Bravo.",2023-10-27
"As someone who knows the games and most of the lore, I give it a solid 6. Probably for someone who doesn't really know fnaf, an 8. I understand that this isn't supposed to be exactly chronological. But, including Vanessa threw me off only because if this was based off of the first game, then she would not even be on this earth as this was supposed to be in around 1990s which looks like it is but security breach is FAR after, I'm just more concerned about how the time line and how the game lore gets mixed in with the movies. I understand that mark couldn't make it but he was still missed. I was also underwhelmed with the ending, as I would have much appreciated if the children were there or there in front of the animatronics instead of just the animatronics when springtrap becomes springtrap since thats originally what happened and would've been more satisfying, other than that it wasn't all that bad.",2023-10-27
"Five Nights at Freddy's (2023) - Peacock
I thought this was the new addition to The Hunger Games franchise, The Ballad of Shaggy & Freddy, but I couldn't have been more off base for Blumhouse Productions first video game film.If you're unfamiliar with the Five Nights at Freddy's (FNaF) video games then you may wonder how they came up with this movie. The point-and-click survival horror video game revolves around a security guard at an abandoned, but still semi operational, Freddy Fastbear's Pizza Place that closed down after 5 kids went missing back in 1985. There are 9 FnaF games and 4 spinoffs to date. I am surprised it took this long to get to the big screen. I wonder how many sequels are coming down the pike in this franchise which is, IMO, destined for a long lasting shelf life.It's rated for 12+ year olds so maybe not for the young young, but the almost not young anymore will absolutely enjoy this. I mean the old old goat enjoyed it but he's also a young young old young baby kiddy boy so take that however you want. It's rated PG-13.Possessed animatronic Chuck E. Cheese castoffs performed by puppeteers from The Jim Henson Company...sign me the F up!!!Josh Hutcherson, Scooby Dooby Doo's bestie Matthew Lillard, Elizabeth Lail, Mary Stuart Masterson and Piper Rubio, try to upstage the true stars of the show...Foxy , Chica, Cupcake, Bonnie and of course Freddy Fastbear.Mike Schmidt, a sleep deprived, down on his luck older brother just trying to get by and do what's right for his much younger sister Abby. Unable to hold down a job, Mike takes a gig as a security guard as a last resort. He knows this may be his last chance as his conniving, cigarette 🚬 smelling Aunt Jane is on a mission to take Abby away from him. Abby is special, she is quite the artist too, kind of like Sarah from Children of the Corn.Just thinking out loud here...maybe Sarah relocated to Utah and is Mike and Abby's Grandma...Mike is trying to figure a lot of things out...he's taking sleeping pills...reading a book titled ""Dream Theory"" and ""Pining for Fun"". Visiting Nebraska might be the key. Just stay away from Gatlin.Mike is becoming a ""Dream Warrior"" (I know wrong Freddy Movie) He keeps trying to solve a traumatic event from his past and every time he falls asleep he gets a little closer to understanding what happened. Befriended by Officer Vanessa, and with Abby's help, maybe this newly formed scooby gang will be able to figure out the mysteries that lie ahead, and those that lurk in the murky past.I would give my eye teeth to hear, ""And I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling kids!""
I give it two rusty, creaky animatronic thumbs up.Don't wait one more night to spend FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY'S.Ghostface Knife Swipe.",2023-10-28
"Honestly the whole set and scenes was perfection, amazing. However the storyline... it was so interesting at first and then they ended it like that... I think it got quite cringe and boring quick. I honestly think Matthew Lillard kinda saved most of it and made it interesting, it was a good twist and he was amazing. Though I don't think the movie is memorable. The set, animatronics and just the whole vibe was definitely the best part. Wasn't necessarily disappointed, because I didn't know what kind of horror it was gonna be, but yeah was disappointed that it got so hard to pay attention, because it got so uninteresting and boring. Seems like a family movie. And also just makes me sad, because I had expected jump scares, to actually get scared and to be entertained.",2023-10-27
1. This is the first fnaf movie we can't blame them if it wasn't want you wanted.2. We are lucky that we got a fnaf movie at all.3. It's not a bad story is based off the first movie after all and that game did not tell us much so don't be so judgmental.4. The visuals are stunning and the eyes aren't a big deal oh no there glowing let's go post on twitter and make Scott change it they were fine the way they were5. I'm 11 and I'm telling some 40 year olds that the fnaf movie is stunning and amazing thank you Scott for everything the games and the movie.6. Also we need to think for a second on how Scott changed peoples life's look at MatPat for gods sake he had to of made over 100 video on fnaf on its own.,2023-10-28
Amazing movie this is by far the best movie ever and i this movie needs to be number 1 in box office and i hope one day that blumhouse makes a fnaf 2 movie cause every fnaf fan would love to see a fnaf 2 movie if it would happen in the future and i would be so cool to see new actors for the fnaf 2 movie and if the fnaf movie keeps going like this then we could get a fnaf movie time line and every fnaf fan would go crazy if we get fnaf movie 2 and fnaf movie 3 and i could lead up to fnaf sb if they want to make a fnaf sb movie then do it in the future cause i would go crazy for it. So rate it now and put it to 10 stars and the fnaf movie is a 100/100.,2023-10-28
"The movie was really a good movie, you shouldn't pay attention to the opinions of the critics, for sure fans of Fnaf will enjoy it the most, and even if you are not a fan of Fnaf, you can still enjoy the movie.I saw the movie and I enjoyed it, and surely Taqesh has been wronged in the film scores.Only people who have seen the movie will understand what I'm talking about. I hope a sequel to this movie will be made.Since the sale of this movie was more than 7 times the production budget, it is natural that we can see the sequel of Five Nights with Freddy's.The usual lovely dialogue: I always come back!",2023-10-30
"When I first finished the movie I was a bit disappointed but then later honestly it was the media effecting me when I was worrying the whole show, it has tons of easter egg inside and honestly the music was fire. If you didn't know shadow Freddy was inside and so was sparky. Foxy appearance with his dun dun music made me happy. If you aren't a fan it would def be confusing but this movie is made solely for the fans honestly. Yes it may not be gorey enough and the Fort is a bit unexpected even if was used for luring. But then again the animatronics, and the stripped kid is actually golden Freddie etc. Amount of easter and mystery inside was nice. I have hope for the next fnaf 2 and maybe hopefully it would be scarier esp with the puppet potential.",2023-10-28
"Walking in I thought it would be underwhelming or a gore-lite yawner, but clearly the critics hadn't grown up with Cawthon's games. As a horror movie, it's eh, yeah, but it's not supposed to be seen that way. It's supposed to be seen as an adaptation of a beloved franchise that has cemented itself in internet culture, especially affecting the generation that was between the ages of 6-11 when the first game came out. Being one of these young fans, I, and many others, cannot imagine a time before FNAF and, judging by the audience review, are thrilled to have seen such a fun, goofy, easter-egg-riddled film. But hey, that's just a theory.",2023-10-28
"This was the best movie i have ever seen and im very happy i could watch it I would very much recommend this movie. If i could tell you my personal opinion I would say the beginning was probably the best idea for a beginning part of a movie because it shows how brutal the animatronics can be. If i could choose my favorite part it would be the animatronics kill William Afton and William says ""I always come back""
this is an iconic quote that he says. And i love the end credits song because well you know everyone wanted it. I love how the had matpat say his famous quote from his Youtube channel game theory.But hey that's just my opinion. :)",2023-10-27
"The Five Nights at Freddy's movie was a delight to see. The cinema was a fun atmosphere with everyone laughing, gasping and squealing at references, scenes and revelations.The movie, however, isn't for people who are new to the franchise. It's for fans who have never stopped loving FNaF. It's not here to hold your hand and guide you through the lore, it's here to introduce a new universe to keep fans from the start interested. If you don't know anything about the game or lore, it's maybe best you skip this one instead, or atleast do your catch-up with Matpat.Overall, the movie is a 10/10 watch if you actually understand the FNaF lore. If not, maybe don't leave a review for a movie you haven't been waiting 9 years for.Signed, not a thirty-year-old.",2023-10-27
Better than I was expecting. As someone that does not know anything about the games I did not go in with any preconceived notions which probably helped. I see it as a good introduction to horror for kids. I appreciate the fact that there is not a lot of gore like most movies. It was tame enough for my 5 year old to enjoy it with just the right amount of spooks for adults also. Overall in my opinion it is a good family movie for Halloween or just families that love a good scary movie. Matthew Lillard is always a great actor to have in movies like this and I really loved the family dynamics shown.,2023-10-27
"This movie is the perfect movie for fans of the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise. However to someone who is new to the fanbase would want to play the games beforehand. This movie delivers long awaited wishes and dreams and delivers them quite well, this movie will have you jumping for joy at the great story and references. This movie could be a little more scarier then what it was made out to be, however it still satisfies that horror crave. For the average viewer this is just your typical cliché horror movie that doesn't go very far for someone looking for insanely scary or gory movies. This movie could definitely benefit more if they also made a Rated R version with more jump-scares and gore. Being a FNAF fan myself I was extremely satisfied with this movie and hope too see a second movie!",2023-10-28
"If you came here directly from the game thinking this will be based on the games alone - you are wrong. This movie is based on a lot of lore and without knowing it, you might be disappointed.If you know your lore - you get more out of this movie than someone who just played the games. My suggestion is to at least read up on some of the lore to have a better understanding on what kind of movie this is. We got several easter eggs, for example in one of the scenes we get the ""bite of '83"".Is it a horror movie? No. There is one or two scenes with jump scares and a couple of ""gore"" (not really) scenes. But that's pretty much it for the horror-part. It's more a thriller and it's actually a pretty decent one.As for the plot - It wasn't that hard to catch on the ""twists"" that was about to come in the later part of the movie. The very first scene with Matthew Lillard made it easy to predict his part of the movie and after that it wasn't too hard to connect Vanessa to him. It's not a very deep plot and much of it is very classic to this kind of movies. Even so - I enjoyed the movie and felt nostalgia while watching it.It's hard to make a game like FNAF to be a really good horror movie, so I'm not really disappointed that they made it more into a thriller with a lore-based story to it. Just sitting in Freddy's watching cameras would've become boring after a couple of nights - which would've been much of the movie if we followed the game.The visuals was fantastic - I loved the animatronics and it sent chills down my spine when they moved around. Even the surroundings at Freddy's was good and if you played the game you'd feel right at home.I believe that if you go and watch this thinking it will be like the game and expect a hands down horror-movie, you will be disappointed. Lower your expectations in that apartment and sit down for some lore and you'll probably enjoy it more.It's worth a watch!",2023-10-28
"The movie was pretty good but the plot was really predictable and it felt kinda numbed down from the game (violence,scares,etc)Also the scene in the middle(i think?) of the movie when the animatronics were building forts and stuff really wasn't needed and probably could be replace with something better.The animatronics though were really good and i liked how they made the restaurant actually feel like a restaurant.I did think the springlock scene was ok but it was really weak compared to the games or the silver eyes novel.I really hope in the sequel they can get a little better but right now i think the movie is ok.",2023-10-27
"If you are NOT a FNaF fan, to be honest, you most likely will not be a fan of this. The movie starts off very slow, but I enjoy how they added the off-screen/shadow deaths for the people who might be huge fans of the games but not of bloody horror films. I myself personally enjoyed Max's death and the fact that they used shadows to show her being bit in half, but at the same time I would've loved to see the goriness of that scene. As I had mentioned non-FNaF fans will be the ones to make this movie's score low just because it is listed as 'horror' when in all reality it is more of a 'thriller' type movie. Another twist I liked was the fact that all along Vanessa was supposed to be helping William Afton and she was supposed to kill Mike if he had any way of finding out that 'Steve Raglan' was not his real name and about the children. But that's just a theory, a game theory! (P. S. I love that the FNaF 1 song, Balloon Boy, and MatPat showed up.)",2023-10-27
"I had high hopes for the movie and I put a lot of faith into Scott and, of course, he delivered! The movie is full of tension and the delivery of the film was incredible. Very cinematic from the camera work to the music. Mike, Abby and Vanessa do an amazing job acting and giving emotion throughout the scenes. I truly don't understand all the low ratings for the movie and it makes me really upset. I've been a fan for a while so I understand the background and I can understand that people that aren't familiar with series would be a bit confused. Also, it's pg-13 so there isn't a lot of gore but I believe that it was a good decision. It allows more highlight on the meaning of the story and adds more tension. The portrayal of mental health throughout the movie is very profound as well. Overall I really do believe that this film deserves more love and I highly recommend whether or not you are familiar with the game series:)",2023-10-28
"IT WAS REALLY GOOD!! It was for the fans, please leave your negative comments to yourself if you dont even know fnaf like that, it wasn't supposed to be made how YOU wanted it to be, as a fnaf fan i loved it, it was cute, funny, cringe. I dont care that it wasn't ""scary"" or anything, all that matters is that we got to see the movie. This was the first movie, ofc it wouldn't be perfect! Just leave it to the fans to rate it, not you. Because if they dont make the other 2-3 movies yall are just gonna make the actual fans upset because your unnecessary opinions, we dont care if you didnt like it ok.",2023-10-27
"Best movie I have ever seen. If you had played the game and know the lore of the game you should go and watch it but if you haven't you should play the game to better understand the movie. As an OG fan of FNAF I rate this movie a 10/10 including the music credits that I originally listened to when I was a kid. Whoever rates it lower than a 5 or below, you better rethink about rating this movie first. Play the game of FNAF first. (Best movie I have ever seen.

"Amazing movie, all the easter eggs, refences, and cameos made it even better. They did an amazing job on all of the animatronic suits and all the actors made the story feel real. The springbonnie costume was probably the best one, amazing details, withering, and springlocks. If you haven't heard of FNaF before the movie might be a little confusing, though all you need to know to get it is the characters. Having the springlocks brought into the story in the backroom and having vanessa false trigger them really proved all weak the locks were. There wasn't much gore or jumpscares, but where there was looks realistic and amazing.",2023-10-27
"If your looking for scary movie this may not be for you, but if you are a fnaf fan like me you will enjoy it. People say its bad because and I get it but in my opinion it was a good movie, if your a fnaf fan you should definitely go check it out.This movie contains some Issues but along the way they explain why is that, well in example there were some corny scenes. Where they all build a fort and lied together on the floor what was a flaw. That was because afton was trying to lure the kid so he can kill her. There was some lore but the movie dosen't really explore or dive too deep into it. Solid 7/10.",2023-10-28
"I give it an 8. My daughter who has played the online game for years would give it a 10. We both enjoyed the shock twist at the end - if you're a scary movie fan, you know. It was fun but also smart - some cool twists & much more than just a animatronic scary movie. I didn't really know much about the story but as the movie progressed, you realize the story is bigger than imagined. Josh H. Is impressive in everything he does but I was particularly surprised that he took the movie seriously & did a fantastic job. Matthew Lillard - well, he is such an underrated actor. I fall in love with him & his characters more and more. He's amazing.",2023-10-30
"Literally on my way home fresh out the Cinema, I liked it just under two hours of good entertainment, acting was good, visuals were great, jump factor was there, storyline was good, go see it, it's an easy watch, nothing too taxing, if you know the game I'm not sure if you'll be disappointed or not to be honest, I've seen the game being played and I was pretty impressed by how they have done the animatronic characters, they are pretty spot on. Good to see Lilliyard in a film again.The length of the film is perfect, they didn't stretch it out unnecessarily.It's never going to be a blockbuster hit, but enjoyable enough.I think 7/10 is fair.",2023-11-01
"Whilst the movie doesn't have the best script or the most frightening scares, it is absolutely entertaining and reminds me of old-school light slasher movies. It's a really fun watch with good pacing and great visuals.Jim Henson's Creature Shop did a brilliant job on the animatronics and I was really invested by the end, despite how silly some scenes would come across without context. I'd highly recommend this if you're interested, especially if you're a fan of the games. A lot of love was poured into this movie and I'd gladly watch a sequel.I'm still amazed that they managed to turn the lore into a coherent story. Great job!",2023-10-29
"I am a long-time FNAF fan and I really liked this film. Plot was meh, some of the performances were meh but the set design, cinematography and sound design were really good and the animatronics were incredible! It was fun seeing all the easter eggs and cameos on the big screen.The plot had some interesting and even unexpected elements and the pacing was good, so I was never bored during the film.This one is truly for the fans and if you are not one, you're not going to get much out of the film. The animatronics steal the show for me, they were really that well made. I hope this film gets a sequel and I think it deserves it.",2023-10-29
"The movie has been something most people had to wait for for around 8 years, and honestly, its been worth the wait. Contrary to what you would expect, it doesnt rely on jumpscares nearly as much as the games, and the ones found in the movie are pretty on point. The animatronics, suits, and the whole pizzeria look absolutely fantastic and exactly how they wanted it to look, and the actors do their job perfectly, especially the two protagonists, which convey the emotions of the characters really well.The plot, although much more simple than you would expect from Five nights at Freddy's, is still interesting and easily understandable once you watched the whole movie. It also has some twists that I personally didn't expect and caught me by surprise, leaving me with a much more exciting time while watching!I think its a movie worth the time spent and definitely better than i expected, even having lots of winks to the fans that don't interrupt the experience for people that havent been in the community! Absolutely recommend watching it and sharing your own experience after finishing.",2023-10-27
"This film was amazing. I couldn't have asked for anything more. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I don't know why everyone is complaining that there was no gore; it was explicitly stated that all the kills would be offscreen, and that there would be minimal gore. It was honestly an amazing experience. My friend and I both shed tears at the climax of the movie due to how intense it was, and how it signalled the end of our childhood. This film is like marmite - you either love it or hate it. Find out for yourself how good it is, and don't listen to everyone who says it's bad or good.",2023-10-27
"I love how the animatronics matched the game. People are quick to point out how ""different"" it is from the game, but forget how much the books vary too. I'm glad that they added new story lines to have me still being surprised after being a fan for 9 years.I love the book references and cameos. The way the story is built up really is building up the hype for the next two movies. If you don't mind light gore and a realisation that the animatronis are just helpless kids, it's the movie for you. The ""goofy"" momenrs just felt like the chikdren being happy to be around another child, especially since Abby is probably around their age. Even in the games, they only kill adultsThis is because they don't remember who killed them so they reach out. It was awesome to see the wholesome and the terrifying side of the animatronics. Red Eyes meaning Afton wasin control was a nice touch.",2023-10-26
"This movie is dedicated to the fans of Five Nights At Freddy's. You will end up seeing other people give a poor review/rating of this movie. This movie though contains Easter eggs which are small hints in details that only people that know about the games, the books, and now the movie. If you are trying to understand the lore of the movie you would have to understand the books and the games. Otherwise in my opinion you have no right to review or critique the movie if you are not interested in the backstory and the how and the why. To be fair there are some issues in writing but overall a great film.",2023-10-28
"I gave this a 10 but really it's a good 7.5 but I feel the 5.7/10 rating on it now is absurd. This was a genuinely good movie and I can't remember the last time I watched a decent box office film in years. This is definitely for the fans or at least those who know a bit about the Five Night's at Freddy's backstory and lore.Casting was an amazing choice, lots of hidden nods to the series and references in it. Enjoyed that they focused on the backstory more than doing cheap jumpscares. I came into this expecting it to be meh, but I was pleasantly surprised how enjoyable this was. Definitely recommended for anyone and especially those who have at-least watched a couple YouTube videos on the backstory or game because it is a fascinating and very unique horror story. Something refreshing for once in an era of reboots and sequels.",2023-10-31
"This movie was such a blast to watch in the theater because you could feel the excitement of the crowd. It was honestly so awesome. This movie had so many awesome moments that really gave the true fans what they wanted with great easter eggs and storyline! I couldn't love a movie more. If you're watching as a non-fan, i'm not sure if this is the right film for you but if you love the lore, it's rewarding! There were great moments that pay homage to the game and silly moments to break those up. Also, those animatronics are so cool, man. They look amazing and i had tears in my eyes seeing them on the screen for the first time. Couldn't recommend enough!",2023-10-29
"I actually really liked the movie, it was suspenseful, it had a good mystery, and some good laughs. If you're in FNAF I definitely recommend but I believe everyone is disappointed because it wasn't fully like the main game and markiplier wasn't in it. Although there was some good, cheesy parts in the movie, all movies have that kind of stuff so don't be too hard. I definitely think it was a well made movie and was super fun. There were all kind of easter eggs in there as well! But yeah this movie was actually really fun and it was definitely worth going, especially with friends! I rate it 8/10 because one, it stuck with the lore pretty well (although they made it a bit different) and 2 (the editing in some parts were OK) and finally the ending part was really dramatic lol.",2023-10-28
"I'm saying this right now, Scott never does anyone dirty. If you dislike this movie, you're either mad it doesn't have tons of gore or that the lore is inaccurate. The lore is bound to be inaccurate, the games, the book and the movie are all diifferent in lore. Sure, it's a little upsetting, but this movie was amazing. It had the horror elements, okay, it didn't have people drowning in blood, but why do you want that anyway? It had the horror and the thrill, which is more than enough for FNAF. The games aren't even completely scary anyway. Needless to say, this movie was amazing and Mike and Abby are the cutest siblings ever. It had every element needed and was a really amazing movie. One of my favourites.Plus, this might be spoilers, but Scott and his team really wanted people to enjoy it from every perspective, even bringing MatPat and CoryxKenshin into this movie. Get over it everyone, this was incredible.",2023-10-28
The only thing that I didn't really enjoy about my experience was the audience. I mean I get that everyone is really exited and whatnot but it was getting a bit excessive when someone threw a bag of popcorn on someone else almost hitting me. But as for the movie I think for PG-13 it's a bit dark but nothings fnaf fans can't handle lol. Even though people kind of thought that since it was PG-13 it wouldn't be scary it actually did give me a few scares while watching. If I were to give this movie a rating I would do age 10+. You should definitely go out with your family or friends to see this movie.,2023-10-29
"Let me put this disclaimer loud and clear. If you are looking for a terrifying movie, this isn't it. I have been a long time fan of the video game franchise and this movie represents them well. FNAF as it is often referred to online has never been a terrifying franchise, but one that makes you ask questions of mortality and morality. I think this movie would be much better categorized as a thriller than a horror movie. By marketing itself as horror it dealt itself a blow. Many people who are watching this to see if they like the IP for Horror are going to be disappointed and that is just the reality.",2023-10-29
"The film started off as ""together we are fnaf!"" type of stuff but actually became decent once the story unraveled, it was funny at a few moments but half the time it felt like marvel humour, i enjoyed myself but probably won't watch it again.There were quite a lot of lore references which i liked, most memorable were stuff from fnaf world and the books with things like posters from the original games.I don't think it should've been a 15, there was barely any gore included in it, all you saw was a shadow of gore, a tiny glimpse of gore, some blood, even the springlock scene wasn't even gory.Better than Willy's Wonderland and Banana Split's but still a low 7/10.",2023-10-26
"This movie is not what the fans really wanted. I expected to see more FNAF lore from the games,and even more easter eggs,but,instead they wanted to create a movie for everyone,not just for the fans.If you want to see a horror movie,then cancel your tickets for this one,because there were like 2 or 3 small jumpscares,that didn t scare anyone. If you are a fan of FNAF though,go with your friends and see for yourself that it was not such a great movie.The action is placed in a strange timeline,where the Freddy Fazbear restaurant is closed due to some investigations of children missing,and strange animatronics lurking around. This guy named Mike is the new night guard,but he is trully not liking his job.I liked that some characters from the games appeared,like Vanessa,from Security Breach,the souls of the dead children in Mike s dreams,and even William Afton,which you will later see who he really is.I hope you will have a fun time watching the movie!",2023-10-28
"Five Nights at Freddy's is a perfectly commercial film. I don't care about the game or the fidelity of the original story, but the film adaptation doesn't make a point of being good, much less being good in the horror genre.Blumhouse has reached the height of mediocrity, achieved thanks to the Hollywood formula for selling films more easily. Formula that makes me reflect on the future of art, and when it will stop being what it is and become a product.But going back to the film based on Scott Cawthon's game: it was barely saved, in short thanks to fanservice, because when you remove the fanservice from that, all that's left is the formula, which consists of supposedly primary horror, which mostly gives way to action and /or the comedy, and last but not least, the stuffing of references and fanservice, which are enough for fans who already had low expectations.In short, Five Nights at Freddy's is a film - nothing more and nothing less than - mediocre, which deserves a 6/10 due to the pleasures made to the fanbase during the film in the way that birds eat until they are full her belly - in little pieces -, and which has some notable visual elements.I conclude that the film is more afraid of the viewer than the spectator should be of the film, as it wastes the potential that a universe as rich as FNAF could offer to the big screen in a more worthy adaptation.",2023-10-29
"I thought this film was absolutely phenomenal, although not entirely satisfying (I think the spring locks should've been so much more dramatic than they were!! Like a silent zoom out of him in absolute agony or something , why can't Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix when his screaming is muted, or something like that)
Other than that, I think this film was absolutely outstanding, and what I thought it was going to be. The attention to detail was incredible. All the little references to other things in the franchise or fan, made things such as Sparky, Matpat, dream, theory, etc) I think references to the fans made the film feel a lot more personal and I think the directors did an amazing job!! I can't wait to see the fairies that come out of this, I think it probably is able to type quite a few loose ends in the series! Also glad that there's going to be a few more ;)",2023-10-28
"I watched it and I thought it was amazing! My friends and I enjoyed it. I think it holds up well. Now, I do suggest playing the first five games of the FnaF series before going. There is a lot of content that you may want to know and the story before going. But overall, it is a good horror movie! PARENTS: read this. The movie does contain some pretty violent graphic material. Of course, not bad because if it was bad, it would be R. But, it's still Brett bloody in places. So, maybe look on resources about children and this movie before letting them see it. I hope you enjoy it too! PS. Suggest it with friends.",2023-10-28
"As a Long-time Fan of the Franchise, Five Nights at Freddy's Delivered on So Many Levels! It's truly a Movie for the Fans.One Gripe I had with the Film however was its Story, Instead of one Linear Plot, it involves multiple Side-Plots converged into one which can often lead to some Confusing Moments.Another thing is the Horror, The Movie focuses way too much on the Relationship between One of the Protagonists, Abby, and the Animatronics. I feel like we Should have Gotten more Scenes of them Hunting down the Cast, as the Trailers Advertised.However, besides that, the Movie was an Amazing Watch! There were some Decent Kills here and there that were genuinely Fantastic and the Ending was Perfect.Overall, Five Nights at Freddy's is a Must-Watch for Fans of the Series but Needs to Up its Horror a Bit and Focus on telling a More Cohesive story!",2023-10-27
"As a film, FNAF is absolutely nothing. With lame pacing, irrelevant and unlikable characters, an uninteresting and tiring subplot involving family bureaucracy, and Vanessa's HORRIBLE writing, those who aren't fans of the game will definitely want to leave the theaters.Now, as the original game franchise was part of my childhood, I couldn't help but give the film an 8/10. The references to the original series, the main plot acknowledging the existence of the game's lore, and the chilling ending made my experience extremely positive and nostalgic. I feel like this is truly an important milestone in the history of the internet and indie games.",2023-10-30
I really liked the costume design and how much they actually looked like in the games. I really like the spring trap suit as it was cool but equally as scary. It was weird having a character that could predict things with drawings but hey it's FNAF so we can pass it. The acting was really good and they actually showed emotion. They acted like they were in the actual situation irl. Even though this movie is not really connected to the lore it's still really good for what it is. This is one of the best video game movies OAT. There are some aspects to be worked on like explaining each character a little more.,2023-10-28
"The story of this film is best explained as somewhat of a compromise between the fans and new viewers. Between those who enjoy thriller style horror and those who are seeking the underlying plot that runs through the film.I think the film works in achieving that pleasing everyone fan that I have met so far, and at the same time providing an entertaining watch for those who don't necessarily have any context for what they are watching.Seeing this film was fun and opened up a whole new world to many people. One of animatronics- puppetry!- complex set design. It felt like the return of theatre in film with plenty of attention given to characters backstory in a move away from the 'give scares- give action'.I will say as constructive criticism that it should have attempted to utilise more adult language and while it was focusing on attempting to highlight and imply gore and death.Perhaps going down the route many rogue five nights at Freddie's creators had gone which is focusing more on the uncanny nature of a kid friendly attraction long since closed, more withering. More long silences and heart beat raising emptiness- preceding scares driven by characters very real fear.Ultimately while a 4-5 out of 10 was expected. And a 6-7 is perfectly reasonable I give it an 8- not only did it come from a small single man enterprise but it delivered on bringing back that sense of practical film making and theatre that is honestly lost on many large scale productions.I hope to see more!",2023-10-27
"Definitely was expecting more horror, however I am really happy with how the film turned out. You have your average jumpscare here and there but it's not too scary. I was more disturbed by the murders happening than I was scared. And the mini Balloon Boy jumpscared me more than the Freddy crew did. I didnt feel scared of them honestly. And it was actually really funny! The comedy scenes hit really well. But they were unexpected in a film for a horror franchise. The scene where they are building the fort in the pizzeria was so wholesome, surprisingly.If you're a diehard FNAF fan like myself, you will immediately pick out all the hidden easter eggs and lore points. But for the average viewer it probably would seem kinda confusing. For example, the mention of ""Dream Theory"", something that does not happen in game but is from YouTuber MatPat from the Game Theory channel, and MatPat also makes an appearance which was a surprise.I do like how they combined a lot of different games into this one film, with references spanning across the entire franchise. However, I feel as though there was too much screentime inside Mike's house and not enough time at Freddy's. I would have loved if there was more shown of the animatronics themselves. They do get pushed aside a lot to make room for Mike's dreams about his brother being kidnapped.But either way, I highly recommend this film for those who prefer mild horror or just love FNAF.",2023-10-27
"It was an amazing experience, as long as you go in with an open mind, you'll enjoy it. It doesn't have the same lore as in the game, and it doesn't have to. Same deal as with the books. Still FNaF, but with a rewritten story. Some parts were definitely better than others and could've been changed a bit, and more action of the animatronics would've been awesome, the cupcake kinda did it all. The ending was good, nice plot twists, good acting, overall anything else was fine. It lacks some, but it also still delivers what it should. It's an amazing experience, especially if you like the games and the books. Treat it as its own thing, another universe if you might, not a 1:1 recreation of FNaF 1 and you'll definitely enjoy it.",2023-10-26
"I don't think its fair to give this a 1 star rating, it wasn't a masterpiece but it was enjoyable to watch. However, it seemed that the movie was too slow paced in the beginning and then by the end they tried to rush everything in a few minutes. It would be better if they made the beginning a bit shorter and simpler and focused more on the nights themselves, as they are what brings the fnaf feels that you get when you play the games.I enjoyed the acting from the main characters, although I would have liked Sppringtrap to have a bit more screentime.The highlight of the movie were for sure the animatronics and the collabs that they made with the theorists of the game. I also liked how they incorporated bits of the lore and eastereggs. I believe this is a movie for the fans.",2023-11-02
"The movie was entirely intended for fnaf fans to enjoy themselves. The plot was changed to prevent it from becoming predictable, and the movie itself gave a good understanding of how the games work,It's obvious that the movie may receive low scores, but that's due to the fact other critics have never even brought the game upon their attention.Waiting 9 years was most definitely worth it for fnaf fans, the movie depicts everything that's needed.The least you can do is appreciate the effort that was made, considering that scott cawthon is inexperienced with creating movies. Overal a 10/10 or 9/10 from me.",2023-10-28
"As a fan of the Five nights at Freddys franchise since its birth in 2014, this movie is all I ever wanted. Not only does it hugely appeal to fans, but I believe this still appeals to newcomers to the franchise. Through not complicating the story and still leaving massive references to the games. I'm no pro at writing reviews but this movie was truly emotional to see on the big screen finally. I will try not to spoil much because I am aware that Australians get it before Americans, but it definitely acknowledges the fan base through the use of memes. To popular quotes from the game's main villain to Foxy's creepy humming and the eeriness of the animatronics as you know they're not as they seem to even revealing something first seen as wholesome halfway through the movie to be very dark in intent. This movie in my opinion deserves 10 stars for its emotional value, epic and on edge scenes with tons of memes (and cameos) I definitely recommend you watch this and please don't yell ""WAS THAT THE BITE OF 87?"" like everyone in my cinema did. Lol.",2023-10-26
"Watched this with 5 other friends and we all laughed and creamed over this epic movie! The story could've been better but the way they put most of what they had to work with together really made something awesome!The references, background details, song choices, practical and special effects, acting, pacing, backstory, EVERYTHING was so well crafted by Scott Cawthon over the course of years.I do believe there were many things wrong as well. The reveal of ""Afton"", the explanation of the characters' motivations (although you can't really expect explanations from Scott tbh lol), and how Vanessa fit into all of it.I do truly think that what we are given is very good. And hopefully is just as good in the coming FNAF productions.",2023-10-30
"This movie is very spooky, scary and fantastic. The animatronics look so realistic. Matthew Lillard, who plays Steve Raglan, did such a great performance in this movie. I was actually waiting the entire movie for him to say ""Zoinks Scoob"" as he did play Shaggy in the 2002 Scooby-Doo Movie. It would be interesting to see Shaggy, Scooby, and the gang solving the mystery of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. My only complaint about this movie is that it made me hungry for pizza, as it does take place in a pizzeria. Anyway, 10 out of 10 stars, you should really go and watch this movie. Yes, a 4th wall break in a review.",2023-10-26
"It was accurate to the game, the story line was not the same , but it was really good. I don't understand why people are trying to kill the movie it wasn't bad. I would definitely watch it again. I would like to see another FNAF movie in the next few years. So everyone stop giving it bad reviews. It had some great actors in the movie and I loved it. It is at least a 7/10.Not sure why some people feel the need to give it a 1 star review. The overall rating should be higher than it is. People need to not get their feelings so hurt because it is not 100% the same as the games. Bottom line give this movie a chance.",2023-10-29
"This is the best movie i have watched in 2023 no question. Lots of people have been disappointed but i certainly wasn't. I went in with extremely highe expectations and i can confidently say that every single one was met. Not to mention the people in my cinema were amazing, just an overall great experience. The amount of references were amazing.SPOILERS!!!!!Some of my favourites was when William Afton (Matthew Lillard) said ""I always come back."" and then got springlocked. Practically everyone in the cinema cheered, including me. Some of my other favourite moments was MatPats's appearance and The Living Tombstone playing in the end credits.I would 110% watch this movie again and give it a 10/10 rating every time, if anyone wants to watch this movie while it's still in cinema's-i would because it is definitely worth it.",2023-10-26
"The FNAF movie is a hell of a good time. As a long time fan it was really enjoyable. The plot itself was well put together and not overly complicated for casual fans. But it was in the little details that you really found the attention that Scott and the team put into this film. As they said themselves, an ode to the fans. The plot was partly adapted from the game lore, but the differences were not so big that it became annoying or less fun for a fan like me. The animatronics looked fantastic. Truly a great achievement from Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Although the film has a 16+ rating in the Netherlands, I didn't find the film very scary. There were some good tense moments, but nothing to keep you awake at night. Discussing the violence and gore, they really didn't show that much. Still, I understand the 16+ rating, because the film does not feel suitable for a 12 year old. In my opinion, there could have been a little more violence though, such as in a specific scene at the end. However, the PG-13 rating in the US had to be considered of course. The background music was well chosen and always built up the tension nicely, with the highlight of the soundtrack being the credits. The acting was good. I didn't need to see anything more in this film than what was given. No Oscar worthy preformances but definitely more than enough for this film. No complains about that whatsoever. The funny moments in the film did not feel inappropriate and were used sparingly. The length of the film felt a little too short in my opinion. Especially the finale act felt a bit short. They could possibly have added some extra screen time in the final act to increase the tension and stakes for the 'real finale'.Overall, very good and entertaining film. As a FNAF-fan, I had a smile on my face throughout the entire movie. Really enjoyed what Scott and the team have created.",2023-10-26
"I loved it, i was waiting for something like this for so long. Its not based on the lore, its at the start of it. Even if you dont know the books or never played the game, you can understand a little. That was the whole point of the movie. It made my inner child so happy. It was such a hard work to get something like this done and it freaking ATE and left no crumbs. So im thanking scott and all of the people who contributed to get something like this done. I stopped feeling so alone knowing you did this for us. Thank you for helping me get through. Thank you Scott for always making us happy. I have so many theories about the movie and the lore. It looks like its based on some trilogy and i cant wait for the next movie to appear. Even if it ll take years, i ll remain loyal.",2023-10-29
"This Film Is An Excellent Adaptation Of The Five Nights At Freddy's Material, The Designs Of The Animatronics Are Flawless, Michels Story With His Sister And Missing Brother Is Amazing, The Cameos Of CoryxKenshin And Matpat Were Both Funny And Memorable And The Ending Was Excellent Done. The Easter Eggs Hidden Within It Are Excellently Placed And The Sequel Setup With Springtrap And Golden Freddy Is Done Perfectly. My Only Real Complaint With The Film Is The Lack Of Set Up When It Comes To William Acton/Springtrap But When He Does Show Up At The End His Performance Is Memorable And Well Acted. Overall This Film Was A Great Watch And I Will Be Watching It Again.",2023-10-26
"Review without hearing or seeing anything about it beforehandNo spoilers ahead besides vague mentions (for fort scene & William Afton)
Right when it starter i already knew it was going to be way better than i thought and way better than anyone else made it out to be. I can see why it would be 4/10 from a critics point of view, but i can also see people joining the hate bandwagon for no real reason.The start definitely itself kept me awake and hooked for the whole film and afterwards (for when i talked about it to my siblings who also joined me)
I'm not a huge fan of fnaf as of right now which will most likely change, but i did grow up with it and still listen to the song sometimes, because they're good and for nostalgia.I'd say i know enough about the story and while everyone said ""it didn't follow the story at all!"" and others saying it follows the books, I thought it was perfect in a way? If that makes sense. I haven't read the books, but the story suit the movie well.I couldn't have imagined a better fnaf movie before, (now could definitely nitpick) i went there fully expecting a 3/10. It's not something you'd make for 8 years or so obviously, but i think it was a perfect time to release it, especially when fnaf fans already range from 13+. Since i was in the cinema, i'd say it was 50/50 where people ranged from teens to full on adults and maybe a very few minority of -13 (not so 50/50?) either way i do think the +13 made sense from a movie maker way considering the fanbase, frankly i think it's kind of stupid people are THAT upset about the gore level, when they obviously wanted to cater it to a lot of fans all around, so it wouldn't make sense to take a whole lot of points off for that.But funnily enough i am gonna be hypocritical, because i do think that if the gore level was up, the ratings would be at least 25% more.The jumpscares were in my opinion good and enough, but people wanted to see even more of that, but it wouldn't have made sense, since not that many people died.The William Afton scene people thought was not enough, which i agree with, as in it went by fast. It did follow the books (in the book it was simple and short) so we could've expected just that anyway. Could've been better yes, but it's again not something that serious.Cinematography wise i liked it, as simple as that, everything else like acting, props were good as well, nothing much to say about that.The actors were perfect for their roles and they fit well, especially with their acting.I think a lot of people's expectations were something not attainable as of yet (as in, you'd need a whole lot more to do it, if you get what i mean. Not in a technical way.)Final answer is that no matter whether you're a kid or an adult (i'd say teens would love it the most) you should watch it in the cinemas EVEN THOUGH THE RATING IS LOW. We spent 28 euros all together and what can i say, it was worth it. I've always liked fnaf ever since i can remember so i was excited when i first heard of it, all thought i did hear faint mentions of it being bad (not full reviews or spoilers as the title says) so my expectations weren't that high already.In fact, my sister said: ""It's like barbie and fnaf were reversed, everyone hyped barbie up just for it to be overrated, but everyone downgraded fnaf just for it to be better.""
Not to bring these two into a fight, but i do think these two were great movies both (unlike my sister apparently).I hope reviews don't ruin any experience for others and they go to view it on their own accord. Most people you're asking are giving a rating based on the time it took and in a horror movie critic way (which many of us aren't so we can still enjoy it to the fullest, in a way)This might be a vague spoiler, but for the people who already watched it: the fort scene made sense, it's 50/50 as in, it showed that the animatronics were still just kids trapped with someone cruel controlling them or that they did all that to lure her in and make her into an animatronic.Probably better to watch with someone close to you though, because there was a group of friends (strangers) behind me and it was nice to hear their commentary. + my siblings, so we even got laughs.Honorable mention: there was a scene where we though the movie would end, but it didnt, so someone yelled out saying: ""will it end already ah"" (direct translation, was funnier in our native language) and the people did a quick laugh, including sincere maybe few ironic claps after, when it actually ended (which i didn't join, but it was fun to hear and watch).Not a scary movie at all (definitely PG13), but had some jumpscares where people genuinely jumped and laughed afterwards, us included.To give an idea, it would've definitely hit off more during literally anywhere from 2015-2019 year, standards were as of now too high, have fun! It's still definitely at least one time watch for everyone who's interested in fnaf.After writing i did discuss everything here with my brother (who rated it 4/10, because of no horror which he is a huge fan of) and other people including then reading reviews and i'd still stick by my rating and review, i think fnaf deserves at least a good 7 as its rating.",2023-10-28
"This movie is based on the popular fnaf games franchise, and this is my review on it:This is a masterpiece and we know that from the quality that Scott Cawthon gives to its games and books everything but it also features some things that I don't like one thing:
This isn't so scary. Every fnaf fan knows that fnaf should be scary ,especially the movie,but as seen, it doesn't have to much scary jumpscares that could actually make people be very scared.This movie is a very good choice for the fnaf fans because it gives lots of nostalgia.Special message:
Thank you ,Scott,for all the great things that you have made for us!",2023-10-26
"I was 6 when the first game released, 9 years of being a fan and 8 years of waiting for this to release, ive really enjoyed the film. It satified my inner child. I loved this film, the animatronics look amazing, the acting is well done by everyone, it stayed true to the games, while also being able to be followed by new viewers as well. I dont get all the hate. The robots were all impressive, adorable, but also horrorfying, with weirdly my favourite being the cupcake. Its so impressive to see robots be into reality, especially ones from a lot of peoples childhoods. Mathew Lillard plays the famous Man behind the slaughter so well, and i love the portrayal. Hucherson played the nightguard so well. They gave life to characters weve never even seen. Impressive acting, puppetry and robots. Only a slight down fall and that of the gore. I never expected guts and walls full of blood, but a little bit more blood splatter for a story about dead kids sounds right to me, however, i loved the kills in it, especially Max's death (the one killed by freddy), loved it over all, definitely worth a watch (or few!)",2023-10-28
"It's fantastic, I know why some fans won't like this movie, but as an og fan since FNAF 3 teasers, I enjoyed this movie even though it wasn't lining up to the games lore and Matthew patthew's theories but I enjoyed knowing who is who and what is what. It definitely gave me shocking moments like the bite of 97, the fazgang and Vanessa as ourple guys daughter (Wait a min, isn't that what MATPAT theorized in SB?!) aand it gave me a hint of nostalgia ofcourse, After all these 8 years, I've finally seen the FNAF movie, with my 2 own naked eyes, and it also feels like my childhood as officially ended... (I have to admit that I haven't beat every FNAF games night 6/7).",2023-10-28
"Every single scene in the Five Nights at Freddy's movie was perfect!!I especially loved when Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy and Mike and Abby and Vanessa all built a fort together using the chairs and tables!!!And Mikes tragic backstory was a perfect addition to the whole thing!!And my top favorite part has gotta be how Steve Raglan/William Afton was slowly crushed to death in the Springlock suit and than left to die!!This movie is absolutely perfect for all the FNAF Fans out there!!I can tell that they put lots of hard work into it all!!And the part where Mike was punching that guy in the fountain.",2023-10-28
"I really liked the film. Everything is extremely impeccable! Good references, the story follows almost in line with the lore of the games we know... Only a few things caught me, and that's why I'm only giving 8 stars:Vanessa is like that character in an RPG who is only there to give information, disappear, then save the character, you know? It's kind of thrown in there and when she says ""dad"" to William, everything we know gets a little confusing...Missing jumpscare. The film was not sold as the scariest of the year, as I saw some comments saying, but it did lack a good dose of scares. The biggest scares they had were just a Balloon Boy doll jumping on the screen.I missed Puppet (because of the song that was leaked a few days ago, which is a version of the famous song from her box set). She could have appeared in the post-credits, which, by the way, was very weak.Golden Freddy and Springbonnie could have more appearances. Self explanatory.There was no confirmation that Mike is really an Afton and that Garrett is really the Crying Child from FNaF 4, but this will probably be shown in other films.That's it, folks! I'm not going to praise the positive points out of sheer laziness, but know that it's VERY worth watching, especially if you're a fan of the franchise! My final score is, even with all the defects mentioned, 8.5/10, it was a REALLY good film!Have a good time at the theaters and I'll see you at FNaF 2!",2023-10-26
"Here are my thoughts on the long-awaited game adaptation.As an avid fan of the hit series, I found it hard to hate. Some bits were a bit corny and silly, but what can you expect? This movie is made like the games, available for all audiences.Fans who disliked the movie most likely went into it expecting an 18+ gore-fest.My main concern with the movie is the ending. It was too rushed and all happened in the wrong way.The long-awaited spring-lock failure seen was underwhelming. Why they didn't make it game accurate is beyond me. Considering all fnaf fans are fans from the games, not the books.Other then that however I found the movie brilliant and is 100% worth a watch for all five nights fans.",2023-10-28
"This is the kind of movie you need to know what you are getting before you watch. Firstly, I don't really understand the tone of this movie. It's way too dark and somber to be fun, yet way too cheesy and goofy to be scary. I mean, the cgi work and animatronic characters just look so goofy even compared to the games! The fact that there was blood, gore, and some light jumpscares must mean they're at least trying to make it scary, but failed hard. It's also filled with tons of horror movie cliches, like the character touching things they shouldn't for example.I did enjoy how this movie put certain things about the game's story into perspective and made it official. Although it's not exactly like the games, and doesn't explain everything. This movie is definitely something... if you're familiar with the games like I am, you would enjoy the context this movie gives. But it's not really good as a standalone horror movie.",2023-10-26
"Like the review title says, the FNAF movie is not bad nor is it particularly good, it's just decent.As someone who's been a fan of FNAF for over 9 years now I've been anticipating this movie ever since it was announced back in 2015, but as more and more information about the movie and its production had come out, I started to lower my expectations fearing that the movie wasn't going to be all that I'd wanted it to be. When I watched the movie last night I realized that my worries had kind of come true.The story of the movie does indeed take plot points from the games and makes its own story entirely, which is alright, the issue is that the way they connect these points together doesn't feel right, it feels like someone who had a base level of understanding of the story and fan theories made a horror movie based on that.As just a horror movie this would hold up a bit better, there are some good scares, tense moments and funny moments in the movie too, and I could definitely see myself enjoying this if I went in with only basic knowledge of the FNAF story.The reason this movie fumbled so badly is that it prides itself as being **THE** FNAF movie, but making multiple decisions that bring it away from what made FNAF originally scary and what made FNAF's story so interesting in the first place.My ultimate thought about the movie is this: if you want a decent horror movie experience, then do watch it, but if you want a good adaptation of FNAF, go watch some fanmade content, there's plenty of it out there, and the majority of it is good.",2023-10-28
"Of course this movie won't do good with critics. These critics (probably) don't know anything about Five Nights at Freddy's, and that's okay. I myself am a hardcore fnaf fan since 2014. I absolutely loved this movie. I understand how the movie may not be as incredible to someone who hasn't even heard of fnaf once in their lifetime. I also understand that this movie won't be the horror movie of the year. But it will be my favorite movie. Forever. Through and through. I cried 3 times just out of pure happiness. That being said, this movie can be enjoyed by everyone, even those who don't bathe in fnaf themed water. This movie doesn't take itself too seriously. It knows it's a funky story about haunted animatronics. It had some OUTSTANDING moments. Along with some other funny moments. It was, in my opinion, absolutely perfect. I will be watching it twice today. The vibe in the theater was really amazing, just a bunch of kids super excited to see something that they've been waiting ages for. It was such an amazing experience. Thank you for your time.",2023-10-26
"It was so good I cannot say anything the acting is great there are some stuff I did not expect like William having a spring lock failure at the end of the movie I like how mike was portrayed and many people did not expect mike go be a different character from Michael Afton I do not know why people say the movies bad everything is just perfect I mean I think they wanted scares but in the fnaf franchise the story matters news outlets and non-fnaf fans cant understand the only problem I have is they just didn't go with the fnaf lore in the games and also loved the part when matpat said ""its just a theory""",2023-10-30
"This movie was an amazing experience with stunning visuals,amazing acting and a good story line. It had action every minute in it from if Mike was fit to have Abby to Vanessa revealing that William is her father,every minute is shocking and awesome. Scott and Jason and Emma did amazing with this and I hope we can get this popular enough that we could possibly get a second movie. I hope that this isn't Scott's last project because he said that the 3rd movie would be his last so if we can't even get a second than Scott may never be able to finish this masterpiece. But still at the end of the day all of this is amazing and everyone from actors to music producers,they all did so good!",2023-10-26
"I stick with a 9/10 mainly because I am a huge fan of the games and books. There were so many references to them and the movie itself was really enjoyable. I wish there was more gore but i can't complain since there will be another 2 movies. I really wish Mathew had more screen time though. In the parts he was in he played it really well. The animatronics and props all looked amazing good job. This movie is very much for the fans so if your a fan you will probably enjoy it alot more than you would if u were just watching it as a normal movie not knowing anything about the games or books. The story line in the movie was simple and easy to follow not to confusing. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the movie.",2023-10-26
"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen! I enjoyed every single second of it. It captures the essence of what FNAF 1 and The Silver Eyes books are perfectly. Five Nights at Freddy's is a healthy mix of funny, adorable, yet horrifying, a little gory and creepy. The vibe of the movie is very mysterious and its plot twists are amazingly unpredictable. The choice of actors and actresses was magnificent and the animatronics look frightening!! The camera angles, set and visuals were absolutely stunning!!! Also, I immediately added the entire soundtrack to my spotify playlist. The music is just such a bop.I have enjoyed this movie so much. I simply cannot describe how straight up good this movie is. It is filled with so many references to the books, games and fan theories. Therefore, as a fan if you know the lore you will love this movie. I loved this experience a whole lot!After 8 years of waiting this healed my inner child.Thank you, Scott Cawthon <3.",2023-10-30
"I've seen this twice and the first time the experience was kind of bad, the audience was talking and laughing at certain scenes of the movie and so I thought the movie was a bit ridiculous and not really scary at all. I thought the characters were boring and I wasn't invested in their stories but then I went a second time and everything felt different to me. There were less people and they were all invested in the movie and it allowed me to see that it wasn't a movie that's barely holding it together but a movie that actually does so much so well.The scares scared me a few times and I'd already seen the movie. The characters struggle is actually really interesting and the conflict of the movie is kind of fun to watch. There's no plot holes just a solid script with pretty interesting characters. I also have to mention how much I love the animatronics and set designs, they went above and beyond to make the animatronics, they are so cute and fun and decently scary when they want to be and the set design is so colourful but also dirty with little Easter eggs lying around it was just amazing.If you're a hardcore fnaf fan you'll love it a lot more than others, there are so so so many Easter eggs that are really hard to catch unless you've got a really good knowledge of the series and there's one thing they do that makes me giddy because of how cool it is. If you're not a fnaf fan you might still really enjoy it, it's so accessible.8/10 love it and I think critics are too harsh and weird as usual.",2023-10-29
"Thought it would be great, at start would have rated it a solid 4 stars if it countinued being good but No. Bad actor police woman and No prober backstories or scared this derserve a remake by a prober produktion. Police woman should never be allowed act again! She Will ruin every piece of content ever made. Ruined halloween. Made No sense. Child actors were actually good, but the script was terrible. Little blonde boy was talented, dosent derserve to have to work in such terrible movies! Main actor was decent had nothing to work with though. No scare factor! The scariest thing about this movie is the police woman's acting. Im going to go Home and sit in a Dark room and Think about how ill never get the person i was before i watched this terrible movie back ever ahain. Dont waste your time on this, look at yourself in the mirror, it Will have a greater scare factor than this movie.",2023-10-31
"I loved this movie, there ate plot twist but not enough to spoil or ruin the other movies, I think that the five night at freddy's movie could be more gory, more blood, I think that it should be in pegi18, this would make it more inbreeding to watch, I think that the springlook seen could of been better, but I still enjoyed the movie, the people that are leaving bad rewiues don't know much about the fnaf lore, but the movie was based on for people that know the fnaf lore, I feel like the movie should of been longer, when the end was coming near, I felt like iv only been there for 40 minutes, although that may be a personal references.",2023-10-29
"Watched this movie with my older kids who have been fans of the game for years. After having seen the massive failure that the recent Resident Evil movie became, I did not have high hopes. Fortunately, I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. I would say that this is possibly one of the best adaptations from game to movie. Much like the game, it was fun, simple, and overall entertaining.Many movies focus on maximizing the gore factor, this one demonstrated once again that showing less is more. Especially with 7ft tall robots. I will enjoy watching this movie again and will add this one to my annual Halloween rundown.",2023-10-27

"The long-anticipated Five Nights at Freddy's movie has finally hit the big screen, and it's a rollercoaster of emotions. While the film certainly captures the essence of the source material and boasts impressive environments, it ultimately stumbles in its execution and leaves you wondering where it truly wants to belong.On the plus side, the movie does an excellent job at recreating the eerie and claustrophobic atmosphere of the FNAF games. The dimly lit pizzeria, the animatronics, and their lurking presence all contribute to the sense that the filmmakers genuinely understood the source material. However, the problem lies in the fact that the film seems torn between wanting to be a ""Saw"" style horror, a narrative-driven experience like ""Heavy Rain,"" or an interactive storytelling piece in the vein of ""Detroit: Become Human."" This identity crisis can be confusing for the audience, as it struggles to find its narrative footing.One of the significant shortcomings of the FNAF movie is its predictability. You can see the jump scares coming from a mile away, and the moments where characters come together for a ""friendship is magic"" showdown against the big bad evil guy feel incredibly cheesy and clichéd. Some scenes are overly dramatic and could have benefited from more subtlety.The character of the cop lady was particularly perplexing. Her failure to communicate critical information, which could potentially have prevented much of the chaos, left me scratching my head. It's a classic example of a plot device that feels forced and frustratingly artificial.One of the biggest pet peeves in horror movies is when characters seem to lose their common sense the moment they're in danger. In this film, the characters make incredibly illogical decisions, like willingly walking into the mouth of a giant animatronic with a neon sign saying ""GO IN HERE TO DIE."" It's hard not to scream at the screen, ""Just leave, for heaven's sake!""The theater experience didn't help either. The constant chatter, screams, and applause at unnecessary moments from fellow moviegoers can be distracting and take you out of the film.On a positive note, the cameo appearance of MatPat, a well-known figure in the FNAF fan community, was a tasteful nod to the franchise's dedicated fanbase.In the end, the FNAF movie offers a visually engaging and faithful representation of the source material. However, its identity crisis, predictability, and frustrating character decisions can leave you wishing for a more cohesive and well-executed horror experience. It's a decent attempt but falls short of being a standout entry in the horror genre.",2023-10-27
"This movie was a roller coaster.The start of the movie was fun, the starting credits were great(But a bit on the nose for any fan). The starting couple minutes of the movie were great. Seeing 'Phone Guy"" die in the 1st minutes was a great fright.Spoilers for FNAF(Willy)
I think the movie shouldn't have been so on the nose about William and what he's done. To many yellow Bonnie's around.The part with the burgers was fun and what I expected this movie to be. What I wasn't expecting was max getting ""Was that the bite of 87"" killThe middle of the movie was too long in my opinion,I think they got their point across well enough. But building a fort was too much. I do understand how they flipped the kindness on its head for the ending, and it did play out alright.First, I will state that all the grips have with the ending is mostly because of the middle being too long.The ending was a little shorter than I hoped for(should've shortened the middle). But it was pretty well done, seeing spring locks was great. Idk I think the ending was pretty good, it just needed more time for William to finally appear. I also would've liked William to destroy at least 1 of the animatronics(like in the FNAF 3 mini game) if he wasn't in the middle of the room, and the trick with the drawings, again, should've been drawn out more and more suspenseful as William chases Abby.Finding out Vanessa was Williams daughter was a suprise to be sure, but a welcome one, and explains a lot about her characterSeeing William getting springlocked was a dream come true, after all these years of animations doing the work we see it in ""real life""(Pg-13) it was great, plus him knowing he will be fine and saying ""I always come back"" was fantastic. Plus the parallel to the silver eyes was great.The movie should've had the door like in the game.MatPat and dream theory. What do I have to say they were great. Good surprise from MatPat plus his famous line, and dream theory finally is confirmed to be true (for the movie).Props to the movie and living tombstone for getting the song into the credits, Bravo.This movie though a tad too kid friendly and weird Middle. But, I say it is a great 1st movie for this franchise and I understand that too make it out of the gate being to violent would limit the people and money they could make.(Thus, less likely to make a 2nd or 3rd one.) Plus, as I see it because this movie made them enough money, they can get a little more drastic with what they present for the other 2. Like Springtrap should be worse.And finally, All I hope is that they make Scott's trilogy and make each movie get progressively more horrifying. I do understand that this isn't the best horror movie, but it's good enough to appease the fanbase....for a few years.But I tricked you
The real last thing to say is.Damn you balloon boy, you have tortured this fanbase for too long and even in the movie. Leave us alone.",2023-10-27
"Long time fan of the franchise, played the games read the books. The writing was excellent, the horror doesn't just rely on cheap jump scares (like the games do), Abby acted like a real child not just an accessory or a plot device, you really felt the stakes for Mike especially his indecision in keeping Abby, the animatronics were perfect-honestly the art department was brilliant, everything really emulated a lot of classic fnaf (aka first three games). Springtrap's entrance was a bit underwhelming (which is a shame, he's my favorite) but honestly that's on brand, everything he's in unless it's a mini game is underwhelming and that includes the movie and it's fun mini game scene in the beginning. The spring lock failure scene was also underwhelming, he should've been screaming in pain but instead he just was like ""I always come back"" (tho gotta admit love his line). I lost my mind seeing matpat, brought tears to my eyes. My sister who doesn't like fnaf came with me and she loved the movie too and now wants to play some games with me and was asking about the lore! I don't have the heart to tell her the movie lore is actually better than the game lore in my opinion. All around great movie I'll be watching again in a few days.",2023-10-27
"I've been a fnaf fan since 2014. I went into this movie with absolutely no expectations. I came out of the movie in awe. I think a lot of people were expecting an r rated movie that was bloody and gory and nasty. I don't think it needed to be r rated to be a good movie. The games themselves were never super bloody and I think that falls in line here. I absolutely will watch this movie more than once. The lore, the pacing, the cameos, THE END CREDITS! It was all so good. I think with no sort of previous five nights at freddy's knowledge it would still be a good movie at face value. My entire childhood and some of my closest friendships were built on fnaf. Lore accurate with incredible casting, 11/10.",2023-10-27

Every cloth, every detail, shows the love and professionalism of the crew.But, as a horror movie is not perfect, it was made for fans like me and it shows. Netherless, it has quality, not as a supreme or perfect film, but it's not a two dollar film.And the animatronics are so cute! Jim Henson's work shop are the best! They are frightening and cute at the same time. A dream come true, specially Bonnie and the cupcake, my favorites from the first game. I just love this movie.",2023-10-31
"I love fnaf, it is a masterpiece. The games are amazing. I did enjoy this movie, however I felt it lacked a lot of horror for a horror movie. It felt much more like a matpat episode than an official movie. Don't get me wrong, the story is amazing. The plot unraveling and twists that even I didn't expect. But it takes up too much of the movie. I am not saying I wanted more office scenes like the games, but a few more encounters with the Freddy's gang would be nice. It felt like Mike never had a horrifying encounter with them, as he only slept on the job. The only time the Freddy crew actually do anything is with the 4 victims trashing the place, when Mike appeared not even on his shift and at the end of the movie. Also that fort montage sucked, they murdered people then went all happy go lucky. So cheesy. Also the William actor was in my opinion not a good suit for me Afton. He lacks the classic British accent and looks nothing alike the book counterpart of William aka Dave miller. Also can they stick with one fake name for William, Dave miller is fine. Mike was great though and the children did well. I loved the dream sequences and for once having a character see the obvious connection and understand the children possess the animatronics. I am excited for the 2nd movie as it can fill in some of the gaps there were, like if Vanessa died and if Mike wins the case in court and what happened to the dead kids. Overall I enjoyed it but it felt lackluster, like as if it were the beginning of a larger movie and not an entire movie. I feel like all 3 (if true) movies will feel like one huge movie and this is just the boring introduction. Also I loved the sparky Easter egg with the restaurant and the animatronic in the back.",2023-10-28
"I was doubtful after seeing the rather horrible rating. In spite of that, I managed to get myself to watch it. And oh boy, it was truly worth my time.Having completely disregarded the existence of the entire franchise, this was truly a positive surprise. Not so much on the horror side, but the plot grew upon me, and the beautiful animatronics were just a cherry on top.We've all been told to not ""judge the book by its cover"", this stands as the greatest example yet for me personally. Horror in general is a genre I despise but the rather mild approach here was greatly fitting.I feel intrigued, time to dig deeper!",2023-10-29
"Spoiler warning. I have been waiting for this movie since 2015 that's 8 years and it was worth it. I really enjoyed how the animatronics were portrayed more as kids and not just lifeless murder robots. I liked all the YouTuber cameos and the characters are developed perfectly and are shown in all their colours. The opening scene with the security guard has a perfect effect of setting up the horror and making sure the audience knows this is a FNAF movie. The questions you are given just to be answered later in the story make you really feel connected to the characters. Things I didn't like were that William Afton didn't show up until the end, he is the main antagonist of the series and it felt like he was squeezed in.",2023-10-29
"I haven't played any of the games, but as a terminally-online person, I've obviously seen a lot of it through cultural osmosis and memes, etc. I enjoyed the movie. I thought it was fun and schlocky, but it damn well knew what it was. I get the impression that the script and direction was trying to be more comedic, but they were pushed to make it more ""serious"" at the request of someone (Scott? The execs?)Regardless, the props, set design, and puppetry - both animatronics and traditional - were absolutely fantastic, as well as the sound mixing and framing of the shots. I had no issues hearing things on my MDR-7506 headphones like I often do in horror movies, and it was a visual treat.The acting was pretty damn good given the unnatural way the characters talk in the script (again, probably due to the conflict tonally between being comedic and serious), and I appreciated the sister character, who I think may have been meant to be autistic (but obviously would likely not be diagnosed, as she was a girl in the early 2000s.)Also, I felt a surprising amount of empathy for the robots, and I'd be down with a movie where non-evil robots befriend a lonely little girl. I'm looking to see more directorial work from Emma Tammi!",2023-10-31
"I grew up on the games and I'm way to deep in the lore. I'm used to bad movie remakes (Percy Jackson) but this was, interesting to put it nicely. The actors were phenomenal. But mike schmidt isn't this random person who los his brother to William man. Mike schmidt is supposed to be Michael Afton's disguise (williams son) after he accidentally got CC (crying child, William youngest son) killed, and after William murdered Elizabeth. Vanessa doesn't even come into play til the whole pizza plex situation. It's definitely a move. All over the place for sure. A FNaF movie series or tv series would be a better fit for the complexity of the Five Nights At Freddy's lore. It's very sentimental, so 10 stars for that.",2023-10-29
"This movie is Truly amazing.Hope there was sequel.Absolutely accurate to a original game
even though i didn't play fnaf but i alway follow all a fanshice.-from a point and click game just made into a
entire horror flim.-i alway say this games is going to be a movie.And it's was true btw
some of people saying this movie is dumb but i think. They just don't known the actual lore in this fanshice and they didn't really seem to be familiar with some characters that appear in a first flim.I was like. Wow this truly amazing all though
it's getting realistic without electric door in actual game.I surprised that scott is actually took few years to made his fanshice turn into a flim.",2023-11-02
"I'm 12 years old in Ireland (in Ireland it's 15a so I was allowed in to watch the movie) I have been into fnaf since I was 7 ,While the movie isn't fully accurate to the very complicated lore it was still amazing i thought the story was an interesting spin on the story of the games still keeping the main story but making it different it was great I really enjoyed it hounstely i only have one complaint, why is bonnie blue he's purple he should be purple ,but I did love that they put chicas cupcake in the movie, it was kinda wierd to hear foxy talking though but it was pretty cool . Overall 10/10 I'm quite happy with it I can't wait till my friends watch it so I can talk to them about it :)",2023-10-28
"This movie is for FNAF fans and people who just want to see a silly fun horror movie. Critics are being idiots just because they can't enjoy a movie for just being fun. The lore is fun, there's plenty of game references for fans of the source material. You'll love it. Make sure to rate this movie highly so we get a sequel. People are unable to enjoy anything at face value anymore because it all has to be a deeper meaning or have some BS commentary on society. Just have some fun get some popcorn and enjoy the silly video game movie. You will have fun. Don't listen to the haters, this is a great movie.",2023-10-27
"I went to see the movie with not very high expectations, but I ended up being pleasantly surprised.It wasn't the scariest movie, although there were a few jumpscares that caught me together with some moments of suspense, but the lore, the animatronics and the soundracks were amazing. I know some might have found the animatronics quite goofy, especially in some scenes with Abby, but we don't have to forget that the animatronics are inhabited by souls of dead CHILDREN.I honesly would have apprieciated a bit more screenplay by Matthew Lillard and consequently more screenplay for Springbonnie, but it won't change the fact that for me, as someone who has played most of the games, it was a solid movie.",2023-11-01
"The movie was good but it didn't feel like a horror film, being PG13 I feel like it lost a lot opportunities but I still had a good time watching it and I hope they make a sequel of some sort. Some parts I found a bit strange like I'm not the biggest five nights at Freddy's fan but i still know more lore than the average person, I felt like they changed key moments that are apart of the franchise that would've made the movie better and more entertaining, I would've like to see flash backs of Freddy's when Vanessa was a child and how the kids where mudered, and the ending scene i think they could've made it a bit more dramatic or changed the way William Afton said ""I always comeback"" and made the actor say it slower but angry at the same time. Still the movie was good and the actors did great hope they make another in the future.",2023-10-28
"I gave this movie a 6/10... the fan service was there for sure, but I have to agree with what critics were saying about outsiders not being able to fully understand the film... I felt like some of the references and themes were a little too niche for standard movie goers.... for instance my girlfriend, who only knows about FNaF from Tik Tok, asked me why the owner of the pizzeria doesn't just watch the place himself... and she asked other questions, that to me, seemed so trivial because I knew the lore, so that throwaway line in the film made sense to me, but not to her. I will say that the main reasons this movie didn't score higher for me was the fort building scene and the ending... the fort building scene completely ruined the tension and suspense that they'd been building up in the first half of the movie... and then it's 3 minutes of this weird happy stuff... because right after that scene ended, it gets right back into the suspense and thrills... so I feel like that scene just completely disrupts the flow... intentional or not, it wasn't good... Another reason I think the movie tripped a little was the ending- I felt it was a bit rushed and they ran out of runtime but they needed to set things up for future installments... the same could be said for the cop character Vanessa, who is nothing more than an exposition tool, who just drops lore and story when necessary, and pushes the plot along, which completely disrupts her character: one second she's happy and introducing Mike to the animatronics, and the next second she's threatening Mike and lying to him about things just because the story needs Mike to ask certain questions and do certain things...This movie had me on the edge of my seat the entire time, even though I knew exactly what was going to happen.. and some of the REVEALS? Oh my word! While the one's about the police officer were expected, it still felt satisfying to hear it said out loud.. although the delivery was a bit corny... The cameos made my entire theater stand and erupt in cheers, and I couldn't help but cheer along. I have to say, I think a lot of the emotions I felt came from the fact that I was seeing Freddy Fazbear on the big screen after YEARS of waiting... that was a surreal experience. All in all, good movie, faz-tastic set design and animatronic work, and I cannot wait for the next movie... it can only get better...",2023-10-28
"It's truly extraordinary that a good film from a game is indeed a beautiful work. I would like to thank the FNAF fans for making a film as cool as this. After a long time I was waiting for this film and when this film was shown in cinemas I immediately rushed to buy tickets and watch this film. Even though sometimes there are some scenes that are less interesting, the horror of this film really stands out. Maybe some people say that the visual effects, CGI and several other things in this film are still lacking. Maybe they don't understand how difficult it is to make a film like this. Anyway, this film is cool, my rating if possible is 1000000/10.",2023-10-27
"JOSH HUTCHERSON WAS SO FINE OMG 😻😻😻 ANDD MATTHEW LILLARD LIKE OMFG. Also this girl got like bit in half but i dont feel bad abt that 💀💀💀 Abby was adorable and cool ig. Also did i mention Josh and Matthew were absolutely stunning?? Bc oml 😻😻😻 uhhh hor hor hor uhmmm i liked the plot twist at yhe end omg also r.i.p. Vanessa soz for anyone who hasnt seen that part ig 😭😭 i liked the red eyes like that was so cool like how do you even do that 🙀🙀🙀🙀 minus one star cuz people were loud at my theater but yeah good movie lol 👍👍 ive read the books, played the games, and watched Markiplier play and watched MatPats theories 😗",2023-10-29
"Everything truly was amazing. Yeah, there were some parts that maybe tuned you out a bit or made you go ""what?"" but it was so exciting and thrilling and will DEFINITELY be memorable so it makes up for it! Definitely not as scary as I'd hoped, there isn't really any jump-scares more ""Oh my god did you see that?!"" The ending was especially amazing because we got the TWO things us fans were wanting: A Living Tombstone song AND a spring lock failure scene!! Along with MANY Easter eggs. This is a movie that I will keep so close to my heart. I'm so glad I got the privilege to see it and I hope we get a sequel.",2023-10-27
"Five nights at Freddy's was a new take on a unique genre which brought a culmination of a decades worth of games, lore and theories together. Even though the plot and characters had their short comings (a thin sub-plot solely designed to be a filler), that was quickly masked by the creative exploitation of the genre, with incredibly detailed props and sets. Many critics walked into the theatre expecting a one-for-one interpretation of the game, which explains their negative reviews. The movie gave the franchise a new perspective and finally stitched up the array of theories and queries surrounding the lore, drawing allusions from most of the games - such as the clever interpretation of the ""dream"" motif from fnaf 4 which formed the basis of the film. I believe a lot of the negative reviews stem from the more canny, natural behaviour of the animatronics, giving them more personality; which explained their homicidal motives in a way the fans have not seen before. Unfortunately, these critics have not understood the films true purpose and are the reason why iMDB ratings have plummeted. User reviews show a much more promising, true representation of the film. Overall, this film was a refreshing take on a long standing genre, a clever, and new perspective on a decade old story that was well executed and well made. Despite the bad publicity from non-lore knowing critics, Five nights at Freddy's ha exceeded the fan bases expectations, happily drawing an ""end"" to a decade long franchise.",2023-10-27
There was a lot of goofy parts in the movie but I just thought they were funny (considering the fact the animatronics are children). For all the people wanting more gore- stop. This movie is pg13 don't expect a bloodshed. The game is made for a pretty young audience so I wasn't expecting any of the scenes in the movie to be THAT gory...If your a fan of the game you will definitely enjoy this...seeing the familiar faces and classic lines that they say it brings back memories. The music they used was REALLY nostalgic. AND THAT BOP IN THE BEGINNING??? Honestly listen to the soundtrack it's so good.,2023-10-30
"I went into this thinking ""it's a movie based on five nights at Freddy's that is only PG-13 how good can it be?"" But I was wrong it was extremely well done and was probably the best movie to release this year apart from the super Mario Brothers movie. Though I loved the movie I think it does poorly as a horror movie but as long as you don't go in expecting to be crapping your pants you will have a great time. I loved the mattpat cameo I wish it was more lore accurate and Michael affton looked a little goofy in that suit but overall I would say this is a great movie that every FNAF fan should see.",2023-10-28
"I just came out of the cinema, and as soon as i got home i started writing this review. The movie didn't disappoint me that much, the visuals were good, the characters were good, and the plot was good. I was a bit disappointed with the springlock scene as i thought it would be really brutal considering how brutal it was in the game, even tho in the game it was showed in pixels. The movie was rated PG-13 which disappointed me, considering the fact that here in our theater in Croatia, the movie is rated PG-15, but thats why i understand that the movie couldn't be really brutal. The movie wasn't ""scary"" it had a few jumpscares now and then, but i wouldn't say you will be scared if you decide to watch it. The movie's atmosphere wasnt that scary, it just didn't give off that scary vibe. The visuals did not disappoint. I absolutely loved the way they designed the rooms, and how well they made the animatronics, the interior of the freddys pizzeria was also well designed, the colors, the details. The costumes for the animatronics were also very detailed, and on point to the original animatronics from the video game. The story overall did not disappoint, it covered the first 2 Five Nights At Freddy's games, so it is expected if another movie releases that its gonna cover the third Five Nights At Freddy's game. The story was kinda expected, and it wasn't really that hard to predict what would happen. I didn't really like the part where they built the fort, it really didnt add up to the scary parts that horror movies have to offer. I loved the movie's story, as i absolutely loved the fnaf story. The movies story is a bit changed than the original Five Nights At Freddy's movie, in the original we end up knowing that the nightguard is William Aftons son, but in the fnaf movie we see that Vanessa is William Aftons daughter, they probably made it so that it would be unexpected, or else pepole will know the story from the fnaf games. The dialogues of the movie weren't bad, but they could've been better, the acting of the movie was really good. Josh Hutcherson really played the role of mike excellent. Overall the movie did not disappoint, the movie had a few jumpscares, but it wasnt scary at all. The people who are not fans of the Five Nights At Freddy's franchise would probably find this movie a bit boring, but the fans of the franchise would love it. I definitely recommend it. 9/10.",2023-10-31
The movie was great the deaths where even better but the ending was kinda anti climactic but still the springlock scene I was not expecting and the goriest part really was the part where Freddy bit Max in half they also messed up the lore because William Afton is supposed to have 3 kids yet he only has Vanessa in this movie none the less I still loved the movie and as a diehard fan I've been waiting for months so I was surprised to not see Markiplier but matpat did surprise me anyway grat movie more of a thriller and not a horror but still a must watch for all fnaf fans. This is to fill in the remaining characters.,2023-10-28
"I took my kids to see this movie last night (ages 12 & 15). They have both grown up playing the games and they were very excited to see this movie. They absolutely loved the movie. They were very engaged and definitely jumped out of their seat a few times (seeing it in the movie theaters with the extremely loud sounds attached to the jump scares definitely packed more punch to those jump scares in the movie).Myself knowing very little about the franchise I was a little skeptical at first. But I really enjoyed the movie as well. I'm a big fan of the horror genre and though it wasn't a rated R movie, it was definitely a good kids horror movie (which I think was the audience the video games were geared to anyways).I've heard some more adult critics criticize the movie because of it not being rated R. Some people want to see the blood and violence that comes with the rated R ratings but I feel as though there's enough horror movies out there that can appease that appetite.I like the fact that this movie was PG-13 and it toned down the violence a little so it can reach a younger audience. Some of my favorite horror movies are movies that aren't overly produced and have a lower rating.The animatronics in this movie were put together by the Jim Henson's Creature Shop and that was amazing. The animatronics looked great and definitely gave out those creepy vibes.I feel as though the professional critics (if that's even a thing) bashed this movie because they had different expectations. This movie was supposed to be a youthful fun/creepy movie for the current younger generations to enjoy and I feel like this movie accomplished that.I had a great family experience watching this movie. Well done.",2023-10-27
This movie was amazing and so thrilling in my book but you need to know the lore to watch it. People saying this movie was bad either don't know anything about the game or don't understand that they can't make this a 5 hour movie. People need to realize they can't add every little detail into this movie and that they most likely aren't going to make another movie or another one for a long time. Another thing is you can turn a movie into a game but it's very hard to turn a game into a movie so I give a lot of props to the film producers... I think that for this being a movie and not a series they had a good input of the game into it.,2023-10-29
It's quite different from the game but still is based on it with similar lore. It could've been a bit more scary but the games aren't that gory or scary so I get why the movie wasn't. It was cool to see all the animatronics come to life. The set for the pizzeria looked really good and close to the game. Foxy was one of my favourites in the movie and when you watch it you'll see why! The start of the movie was very good and made you want to keep watching so it was a good way to start the movie I'd say. I recommend you watch it as soon as you can and don't listen to the negative stuff going round watch it for yourself and then you can decide whether it was good or bad.,2023-10-27
"This was an amazing movie but Abby was very annoying. The jump scares were not super scary but the animatronics were cool looking with an unsettling feeling to them. Again, great movie but the lore was completely different which was confusing to me at first. I know all of the lore so I told my friends all about it before we watched it. When we found it was completely different it was very confusing. We then understood it was different half way through then did not think about the actual lore. It was an amazing movie overall. I liked the plot twist were Vanessa was Aftons' daughter. 8/10 would recommend.",2023-10-31
"Okay, I'll dive into this.The movie was ""alright"", I went to see it today with my mates and afterwards we talked about what we thought, we all agreed that it wasn't that good in our opinion. For example, Animatronics have almost no jump scares (0 good ones at least). They're all predictable. One of my friends said that he didn't like how they incorporated the Springlock scene (A scene where William Afton is 'killed' inside his half Animatronic, half human suit). Whilst it did include some gore (you can see the metal ribs stab into his chest), it didn't have the same feel to it as the game, especially when William starts laughing instead of shouting in pain and agony, we all agreed that it would've been better if he was in pain, and not enjoying himself so much.I'd also like to add this on top, a majority of the movie was spent trying to keep the kid touch to it. Like when there is a literal montage of the animatronics building a fort with Mike S. And Vanessa (Cop. Won't give spoilers on her) with Mike's younger sister who is now friends with them all? I get kid's friendliness, but I would've liked to see it as if she sees them as regular kids (instead of just snippets), and others see them as the animatronics or smth.Now, I can't shout down at the 'kiddish features' because don't get me wrong there was a sweet ounce of solid GORE in this movie. Like the messed up face of the intruder who was killed by Chica's cupcake, as well as a AWESOME kill scene were a woman is lifted into Freddy's mouth a completely cut in half (everyone of the boys LOVED that). But obviously it was only seen in a shadow.1 final thing that is on my nerves, they decided to keep the kid *that after went too far with* at the main front...but I WISHED it was the crying child. Just to have a live action crying child in the hallway like that would've been top tier.Anyway, don't get me wrong. I'd watch it again and I kinda do hope they make another one because it would be cool to see all the rest of the animatronics in a live-action movie. I just hope next time, they try to add just MORE from the games, and not let's say...build a fort?(Don't think I won't forget about MatPat's appearance and how furious he must be with how his timeline doesn't even make sense with this new movie)...",2023-10-28
"This is a movie which has been in development for so long, and if you're a fan of the video game series then you've been anticipating it's release for many years.As a fan myself i can say i'm very happy with the result. You can tell everyone who worked on this movie but a lot of effort in to please the fanbase.However if you're an average movie goer then there is not that much for you here. You could enjoy it, but it's not something you'll recommend to your friends.Things that were great: The music, The acting, The animatronics & The ending.The script works, however it feels a bit rushed at times.Overall the fans will enjoy this movie, but if you're going in without knowing the source material you shouldn't expect too much.",2023-10-29
"Good, but they could've done better. They stick a lot more to the comic series lore instead of the video games which i believe they should've stuck with the video games lore. They didnt stay too accurate to the games, they stay more towards the comic series which im not a big fan of. The springlock scene could've been so much better, not enough screaming or blood. Not enough gore or jumpscares like in the original games.Overall, great movie. Good acting. The animatronics were fabulous. Definitely good on realistic features. Awesome, but they could've added more or made it more accurate, still a great movie. Definitely recommend a watch.",2023-10-28
"Or or or or or!!! ""together we are fnaf"" wasn't included which was a DISAPPOINTMENT but actually amazing, critics suck i don't want to hear you haters saying it's bad, obvi you don't understand the LOREEEE. Major plot twist that was lowkey a surprise but like i love a little family drama. Everyone saying it wasn't scary doesn't understand the audience like... hello this is for cringey teens and the friends we drag along. Fnights at frieaddysss that's where i wanna be, fnights at frieaddys!!!!! You but basically if you are some random person who has no clue about anything fnaf you'll prob hate the movie but if you're a nerd you'll love it!!!!!!!!!",2023-10-31
"As a fan of fnaf franchiase. As a fan of the FNaF franchise since 2015, I honestly really liked the film, but at the end of the film it has its ""3rd act"" which is a bit rushed and with much more emphasis on Mike's life (before the ""3rd act"") and his relationship with Abby; Vanessa was a surprising piece in this film.The references this film has are well thought out and very well placed.I wouldn't consider the film to be children's (as some people do) and there is an amount of gore in one part or another that is a bit shocking.As a fan I give it 9/10 and with my critical sense I give it 7.5/10.",2023-10-30

Really well done to the creator's work I reccomend to watch this movie well detailed and very interesting to catch up on. I'll give 10 stars movie was so perfect I was waiting quite a while now it was all worth the wait for thank you Scott really appreciate the effort you put into these and I wish the best for you happy Halloween and hopefully I can't wait to see more future updates you will add I'll be here waiting this is honestly the best movie I came across to and please no matter how much hate there is out there I know you will still put in the work Scott and again thank you for my childhood love the work.,2023-10-30
"To start off, if you are going into this movie thinking it's going to be a mainstream, gory, blood-filled slasher style horror movie, you'll be disappointed.However, if you love and appreciate the lore, are familiar with the games, and you're looking for a great movie that gives you everything you love about the lore, the games, and even some comedy thrown in, you will absolutely love this movie!!I will say, upon first watch, I thought the beginning was a little slow. It takes a good 30-45 minutes for it to really get started. But after that, once it starts going, it hits the ground running.All of the actors and actresses did a PHENOMENAL job with their characters.The animatronics are unbelievably real. The Jim Henson Creature Shop did an amazing job bringing the animatronics to life!There are 5 photo cameos in the movie, and 1 in-person cameo (who actually interacts with some of the characters and has a few lines)
I would classify this movie as more of a kids horror movie. Most adults probably wouldn't find it scary. I found it to be more creepy and intense than anything else, but there are still some pretty good jumpscares.In closing, I'll always come back to this one. 😁",2023-10-30
"AMAZING! I know people say it's not accurate to the lore but to be fair there never was an official accurate lore, so honestly I didn't mind the changes. The movie overall was an amazing movie. It's not a good scary movie but it's a great fnaf movie. I feel like it's still enjoyable to people who aren't familiar with the fnaf games because my older family members loved the movie. THE DETAILS WERE EXCELLENT!!! I know you have to be a fnaf lover to understand the small details and eastereggs within the movie but they executed all of them so well. From balloon boy to the ""It's me"" written on the mirror to even foxy singing his little song! I also love the scream/ghostface reference they had Mathew Lillard do since he was in the scream movie! Overall it was an amazing movie and I can't wait to see others they make! I also can't wait to see Markiplier in future movies hehe I was so happy to see Matpat and Coryxkenshin!!",2023-10-29
"Did well:
1. The Animatronics are designed realistically, keeping true to the original.2. The setting of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza is faithfully recreated, showing a scene of a pizza shop in the 80s.Not well:
1. The plot is relatively okay. But it is shown in a sketchy way. Sometimes, it causes confusion for viewers. Sometimes it's too fast, sometimes it's absurdly slow. If a person does not know the main plot through the previous game of the same name, it will be difficult to follow the story line.2. The film crew could not maintain the dark, creepy atmosphere of the original game. That is the feeling that even if there is no animatronic, when standing in a space like that we still feel scared and insecure.",2023-11-01
"Despite the rough criticism resulting in this film's almost 2 hour runtime, the movie itself isn't as bad as critics depict it to be. Is it amazing? No. But it's not horrible either. Scott Cawthon took a simple concept of his hit horror game and experimented with the source material - which is quite faithful.The movie can feel dragged out at times with questionable decisions and desire for a lackful story, but with such a simple concept, you can tell that there may have been some struggling when it came down to horror and comedy.Is this film enjoyable? Absolutely. Depending on the audience, you can genuinely have an amazing time with this film if you enjoy the franchise; however, if you haven't heard of 'Five Nights at Freddy's ' chances are you may not have the same great time.",2023-10-28
"This movie is awesome but if you want to understand the quotes and references in the movie you probably have to be a fan of the series. This movie did not deserve the hate and the pacing is really good it is never too slow or too fast. The way characters are introduced will keep you wondering who is next.(SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!!)
This movie does not lack in creativity and excitement.It may be corny at time but this does not bring down the pace or feeling of the movie. The way they introduce Mat Pat and Coryxkenshin is immaculate.The way they lead up to the reveal of William Afton is very well done.Also how they introduce the springlock scene and the iconic quote ""I always come back"" is awesome.",2023-10-29
"I thought the movie was good but it was not at all a horror movie. The animatronics and sets were remarkable, along with the cinematography. The biggest flaw about this movie is that it's PG which watered down all horror aspects of the film. With that said though, the casting was done really well and the acting was solid. This would be a perfect family horror movie as its no more scary than a goosebumps episode. The sets and animatronics make the movie worth watching for the nostalgia alone and the decent pacing make it feel like a much shorter movie than it is. I really wanted to give this movie a higher rating but it just wasn't scary enough to be a fnaf movie.",2023-10-27
"Five Nights At Freddy's The movie is AMAZING, and although for the story it had it could have lasted, a little longer, like 2 hours 10 minutes, it is not longer than what it actually lasts but this would have given us more answers to the story , although it is the same as video games leaving many open questions and other topics unanswered, such as: What happened in the end with Vannesa?, or What did Mike do when he got home and saw his aunt? The movie has several ups and downs, like any other horror movie, if I said which is the best BlumHouse horror movie. The film is entertaining and if you don't expect it you may get a little scared, for me to be able to enjoy it you must experience it in the cinema.",2023-10-29
"I've been a fan of fnaf since it first came out and this movie knocked my socks off. It's an incredible thriller/horror movie with incredible character development and a giant plot twist. It's better than most movies and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the franchise. They did so good designing the animatronics and pizzeria. I was expecting your regular boring run-of-the-mill movie, but I got horror gore and much, much more. In conclusion, this movie is great and you should watch it if you are a fan of fnaf, gore, horror, violence, or just looking for a laugh, go watch it. You will be amazed.",2023-10-29
From my perspective there was nothing you could do to show all lore but there is some things I wish was shown but over all great movie with some comedy some horror and I movie I think any fan would like or love. A few things though is I wish Golden Freddy was in it and maybe showed more of him in the room and closing the doors when too close another thing is well not most people might agree but I miss phone guy. Over all nice movie for fans and needs more movies for all the lore if you are fans like that if not it would just be fun to enjoy and experience these last moments before Scott retires.,2023-10-29
"The film focuses majorly on pleasing fans, by either having a story in tune with the games, or by simple fanservice. Important gameplay mechanics of the Five Nights At Freddy's games are key elements to the film, as well as some nice touches in the form of references and easter eggs scattered throughout the old restaurant. When it came to the animatronics, they looked so impressively built, designed and controlled that you would think they were CGI or at least partly, but it wasn't the case. They are some of the best practical effects I've ever seen in film.Story wise, Five Nights At Freddy's started off strong with some pleasing horror elements and a surprising amount of gore, such as someone's face being torn into, a women being bitten in half and a substantial amount of blood being shown -- A relief to many as there was a fear the film would cater too much for children, and it wasn't the case.However it was followed by some blatant cliches that can often be found in most PG-13 or under horror films, where children feature prominently in the cast. The animatronics which were at first shown to be brutal and unrelenting were then shown to be understanding, emotive in body and facial expression, and playful to the cast. A decision that makes no sense in my opinion, as it takes any fear from the animatronics away. Yes, it's weirdly wholesome and a nice change of pace, but not for someone who was expecting a mostly horror-themed film. The choice of narrative explaining the change in the nature of animatronics is cliched, and then immediately gets subverted with a plot point introduced at the very end of the film, where it is revealed the overarching antagonist (Matthew Lillard) controls them. The reason how is completely brushed aside, specifically by Vanessa (Elizabeth Lail), a rather unwanted character responsible for most of the silly and convoluted exposition.As it happens, the emotive facial expressions, such as the frowning of eyes or showing of teeth is a complete contrast to the blank, emotionless animatronics that feature in the games, making them far more human and far less unnerving. This doesn't help their case when they have already been subverted to be friendly at a certain point in the film when the movie should have been entirely, if not majorly, horror/thriller.This was definitely the weakest part of the film, the rushed plot. Matthew Lillard's talents were completely underutilised, with him only appearing for around 5 minutes in a 1hr 50 minute film, and several vital plot points, such as the ghost children being manipulated by William Afton (Lillard) and their reliance on hand-drawn pictures for general understanding was brought up last second, leaving us little room to really grasp the conclusive finale the film was laying out for us. Instead, the animatronics are dealt with in simple fashion, Afton is defeated suddenly, and is then promptly brushed aside where he will no doubt heavily feature in the inventible sequel.Although it feels I am heavily scrutinising the film, these narrative weaknesses were already expected by me and a great many other people. The direction of the film was excellent, and it looked visually stunning. The lead protagonist (Josh Hutcherson) had a good amount of depth, and felt very human, not to mention had a very good performance, a very real performance. In other words, the film was better than it had any right to be. You'd find it to be very enjoyable and it does well to pay homage to the original games and the fans. Passion is clearly present in the filmmaking and I would recommend a watch.",2023-10-26
"I've watched this film a week ago and as guy, who know FNAF franchise for 8 years, i like. No, i really like it. It's not a masterpiece, it's not looks like a scary movie, it's a good comedy-triller-mildhorror for a good evening. And whatever what ctitics says about this film and whatever that movie isn't accurate with lore at all, IT'S A GREAT FILM! But this movie is created for fans and for people, like me, who know that full franchise for a long time. So if you didn't know something about the franchise early, you may don't like this film. But if you're sUpErFnAf-critic, you're 90% gonna HATE this film. Anyway, i like it so much and i think that probably in some time i'm gonna see it again)",2023-11-02
"I really love the FNAF game series so I was excited to see this. It did not disappoint, despite a lot of mixed reviews. However, that's understandable, as this is a movie stemming from a kid's horror indie horror game. I am also a huge fan of the lore from the FNAF series so coming into this movie, I knew that Scott Cathwon is unpredictable when it comes to the ""story"" of the games. So what I was given, I was happy with. Now, there were some iffy things like some of the lore being mixed up and changed, the lead female protagonist being a little strange and it felt like there was more they could have done. I do know that this is not the last movie as there will be at least a sequel to this one. All I can say is that it was a bit of a rough start but the potential is there to get the lore and story to more than just the fans of the game.",2023-10-29
"I don't know why but I LOVED this movie. As a fan of the franchise for around six years now, this was incredibly nostalgic. I'd like to get the bad things off of my chest first before diving into why the movie was great.First, the cons. The major con of this movie was that Afton, while played by a good actor, was only in the movie for ten minutes. It was a missed target by the creators and honestly it's a bit sad because Matthew Lillard is a good actor and did a good job playing him, even if he was only in the movie for a little bit.That was my main concern. The rest of these are minor. The runtime of the movie was a little long, but that's not a big deal. The big 'party' they had was unexpected at first and honestly kind of funny, but it got a little too long for my liking. Finally, the overuse of the kidnapping scene was an annoyance, however that kid with the bleeding eyes gave me a good scare when it appeared.Now for the goods. Kudos to the creators of the animatronics, they looked excellent and very few CGI was needed. The story, while a bit rocky at points, was actually pretty good for a lower-budget movie. The actors did a good job. All the little Easter eggs were just awesome, and the cameos from Matpat and Coryxkenshin were both amazing as well. Added to that, the scares (when there were some) were actually pretty scary, and the balloon boy that kept appearing was clearly Scott trolling us on a larger scale.Overall, the movie gets an 8/10. -1 for less Afton, -.5 for the long party, -.5 for the overused camping scene. I was impressed, as the bar had been set really low. Great job and can't wait for the sequel!",2023-11-01
"It's a good movie, although, yes, I admit that it falters in some parts, most of the movie I loved (I clarify that I'm a big fan of fnaf), the appearance and background I liked, the appearance of William Afton and the murders were beautiful, I liked the scene of how they played to gain Abby's trust, in general very good and with good scares, highly recommended. Some very good examples of what I'm talking about are the multiple references to the community that occur, such as the animatronics trying to stuff Mike into a Freddy suit when they capture him, the aggressiveness and fear that you get from seeing William Afton with the SprongBonnie suit, the many cameos to the books, the jokes that are not tiresome but very good, although some parts are kind of bad, like the appearance of Golden Freddy where he appeared and left very quickly and almost without utility, but in general the good moments are most of the movie, the bad moments only last about 7 minutes.",2023-10-28
"Being a fan of the franchise since I was a kid, it was almost surreal to see an otherwise ambiguous set of characters, locations and plots come to life. Watching this film took me back to the days of the first game instalment, when this seemingly small indie game took the internet by storm. To say the least, this film gives time to the franchises long-running narrative into a more concise telling that most fans will enjoy.However, that just may be its problem. The film, although appealing to myself and many others, seems to be for the fans entirely. Anyone outside of the fandom will suffer through this film as something without substance given no prior context. This would be my only gripe with the film. Moving the series into a new medium of storytelling that prioritises live action aspects, should've been made more inclusive for more than fans.I want a sequel, and hopeful the plans for a trilogy are able to proceed. But is it likely to happen? Questionable.",2023-10-28
"After the nine year wait, this seems to be the best they're able to create. The movie lacked any real FNaF references and had very very simple connections to the games without being too in depth. It was disappointing to see that movie is only rated M (PG-13) since that showed that there wouldn't have been much action. That was right. There could've been so much more gore and throat gaggling scenes to make it better. They did get me with every balloon boy figurine so haha funny. The animatronics looked absolutely amazing. There was so much attention to detail applied to them, which I'm guessing is where most the budget went. The movie seems to be quite distant from the lore that's been building up over the based decade. The springlock scene did not exceed expectations, actually that was probably the most distant thing from the games and the lore. That could've been so much better and had so much gore applied to it. He will always come back so I guess that's a good thing. The doors in the office aren't the same as the first game, and the place was called ""Freddy Fazbears Pizza Place"", which are both little details that don't matter but would've been nice to see if the movie location is meant to be based on the first game location. There was zero jumpscares at all, unless you count the Ballon boys. Jumpscares are very centric for the games, and should've been incorporated into the movie at least once or twice. Vanessa (The police officer) mentioned the place having a cutting edge security system, which seemed like the animatronics from the second game, but in the models from the first game. Having a few animatronic point of views, during glitches, scanning or looking at hostile people, either the ones that broke in, or during the final few scenes, would've added to the atmosphere alot more. Personally, I enjoyed the movie. I wasn't too deep in the lore to be disappointed where I just bluntly hated it, but I'm also not, not into the lore a little where things could've been done better. If you're watching after coming from only the first few games, it is a really really good movie. However if you're coming from playing all the games, reading all the books and short stories, watching fan movies or YouTube videos about the lore, then you might not find it enjoyable, since it is set distant from the popular lore. It sucks that Markiplier wasn't in this film (not even ending credits), but he is sure gonna be in the next one. MatPat (Game Theory) having a cameo and saying his iconic ""it's just a theory"" settles the mix-matched atmosphere of the film. For the budget they had, in the time they produced it, I can forgive the rating and the minimal gore. All in all, I'd say it's a good movie, but not the best. I'm excited to see what they put together for the second and third films in this series.",2023-10-27
"The fnaf movie is literally almost perfect. I don't get why critics are being idiots and giving it the lowest scores possible when it was literally a masterpiece. I guess it's the Mario movie situation all over again. The only complaints I have are the fort scene because of how just... childish it is, the fact that the movie isn't even a horror movie at all, it's totally more of a thriller, and that William Afton rushed the ""I always come back"" at the end. I guess it could've been corny if he didn't, but whatever. Other then that I love the mystery aspect too and the casting. W movie 10/10........",2023-10-29
"I am a fan of the FNAF franchise and I loved it. The characters were great, there was just enough suspense and horror/gore, the storyline was pretty spot on and the the aesthetics were of quality and true. I don't understand why there are so many bad reviews. It's a kids game turned movie so it's not going to be some super horror film or have some complex storyline - people are way to critical. I hope they come out with other films/projects so we can see more characters. My family and I had fun watching this at home to celebrate the Halloween season. My favorite animatronic shown in the film would definitely be foxy.",2023-10-28
"I have been a FNAF fan since day one. Hardcore Bonnie fan. I know all the convoluted lore with the games, participated with the fandom for years, and know mOST of the books. Okay so here we go..I was so excited and I enjoyed it! And..
I DONT GET THE HATE. WHAT WERE YALL EXPECTING?? Did people expect the past 8 years of lore to be explored and made to a T exactly how it was portrayed in other media? Most of the lore wasn't even directly IN the games it was hinted at. The ""wasn't scary"" criticism doesn't really make sense because FNAF isn't a particularly scary game.A lot of what made the five nights at Freddy's series interesting was uncovering the lore and thinking about the mystery behind it. A lot of it was the psychological aspect of the animatronics and the child's souls. I feel like it's unfair to say that the game had to be super scary like some of the fan made content. The actual game did not directly have a lot of this stuff that it was made into online. I feel like this movie portrays the lore not only in a simpler light, but takes the important parts and builds a cohesive narrative that's enjoyable and doesn't take forever to understand.Could it have been better? Maybe. Could it have been SO much worse? Absolutely. Read the 9 original script ideas Scott posted. This is the best one. It was executed quite well. The beginning was a lil slow but it was worth it.It has FAR simpler lore while humanizing the souls of the children, giving us characters to care about, and producing an absolute nostalgia trip. The sound design and cinematography was great. The animatronics genuinely look really awesome and the artistry that went into it is on display very well. It's obviously made for the fans and I appreciate that with my whole heart. I will die on this hill and defend this film because people are getting way too mad because they didn't get an R rated gorefest. I understand it would've been cool but at the same time I feel like after a while of seeing animatronics rip people apart and staring at cameras for two hours it would've gotten boring pretty quick.People seem to not like the fort scene but, once again, it humanizes the children and reminds you that they are indeed... just children. It's wholesome yet tragic. Even if they were trying to manipulate Mike and Abby it still is very effective at making us like them. I do think the spring lock scene could've been a little bit more dramatic but I actually really enjoyed it. I loved seeing William. This is a very important film to me. I need more. Seriously. I beg.",2023-10-28
"It has kept up with the storyline that the game has, and I have to say that the film was fantastic, I think Scoot can be proud of what he has done, and you can say that it is a film you have to see, it must be said that it is perhaps lazy should have been for 18+, as it is a bit creepy due to the things that happen in the film, as I don't think a child of 7-8 years will be too scared by it, and also because you can see that it ACTUALLY made the character from played by, instead of the 3D thing models that other studios use, so Blumhouse has really been creative, and also because you can also feel that more has been made of the film than the others, so 10/10 :)",2023-10-27
"This movie has been made for all those fans for years, and in my words it was simply perfect, managing to recreate my favorite video game on the big screen, I simply fell in love with it,In addition to the fact that the film is full of references to games The performances are good, and not to mention the animatronics, they seem like they were taken from the game itself! The plot was good, especially when the animatronics seemed to act ""friendly or good"" but were only trying to gain trust and then reveal their true intentions in all that time.In my opinion, it is a film that satisfied my great fanaticism for the franchise :')",2023-10-28
"It was cool to see a bunch of different aspects from the other games alongside the books and the involvement of cupcake was just beautiful. The easter eggs are cool but i feel like you have to be actively around the community from the beginning or dedicating alot of time to the theory portion of the fanbase to truly understand it but its still enjoyable to people who dont catch all of them, odd but still okay as a movie adaptation. Even my boyfriend who doesnt really know alot about fnaf besides the bits and pieces hes learned through me and a few of his exs watching thought it was pretty okay considering its based off of a simple game and was entertaining. It was overall just cool to see it actually professionally brought to life.",2023-10-28
"Let's start with what I liked. I liked when matpat showed up for 30 seconds, and I liked the ending credits songs. Now to what I didn't like. I didn't like the fact that this is a movie, based off of a horror video game, and made by a company that specializes in horror movies, was not in the slightest bit scary. There were maybe a few attempts to be scary, like the start with the security guard and the part where the animatronics kill the guys who broke in, but there wasn't a single time where I was actually scared. It was unbelievably predictable in every way, and at one point I almost asleep. The acting was okay for the most part, and the visuals were alright, but I just wish there was more... horror...",2023-10-27
"As a diehard fnaf fan I will accept my bias in this review and rating but what I will say is, as Scott said. It is made for the fans, hense why the critics score is so low.In terms of references and easter eggs linking back to the games it perfectly handles this, just like the Mario movie the major misconception is that it will uphold a major Hollywood story and cinematics. As a video game adaptation it scores almost all the key points which makes it perfect. This is why as a general movie, it's mediocre realistically, but for a movie that is based of the video games and is for the fans it is near perfect.There are a few moments, like the ""fort scene"" which rubbed off me the wrong way, and later on it makes sense but I feel the execution was a bit cheesy. Another segment was the ending. Matthew Lillard aced his role bringing his character to life. However, I do believe that his screentime was too short and therefore strained him of the potential for a more powerful ending. Visually it's a great ending but there is no doubt some more minutes could've greatly saved the ending.Another point was Vanessa's connection to William Afton, I do understand that the film doesn't follow exactly like the games and thinking that it would is a bad way to look at video game adaptations, but I do believe the story there was a bit scrappy and full of plotholes.I loved a particular persons cameo as it was hoped by many that he would be in.Overall it is an AMAZING video game adaptation and as far as movies go it nails it well.From my personal opinion I do think that if you are a fan of the franchise you will definitely enjoy it. Just don't expect the movie to be exactly like the games!8/10.",2023-10-27
"The movie itself was amazing, great casting and special effects. For any fans of the game, you'll probably like this movie. It's not the gore-fest that some people may have been looking for, but it's still great. The only thing that I didn't like was the movie felt slow at some parts and one of the plot twists completely disregards the lore of the game itself. While I do wish it was a little more graphic and more tuned to the lore of the games, overall it was a fantastic watch. Definitely would watch again, and I loved all the cameos from different people involved in the actual FNAF community. Looking forward to a sequel, just maybe with an R rating.",2023-10-27
"Despite the slow start, and the weird looks of the animations in photos, this movie was absolutely amazing! References to both the games and books, amazing story and excellent execution! I am nothing short of amazed with this, and I hope the next 2 bring just as much joy, and excitement, as this one has. Great job Blumhouse, amazing job to the actors, good job Jim Hensons Creature Shop,band thank you Scott!This movie had me second guessing a lot about the main timeline us theorists have all agreed on so far. If you haven't seen it yet, you need to, and theorists, get those brain gears turning, it's theory time!!!!",2023-10-29
"As a long time fan of the games and a lover of anything Matthew Lillard, this film hit all the marks for me. The critics couldn't be more wrong.There was nothing about this movie to really hate or even dislike. At the end of the film, my overall thoughts were, ""I wish there was another hour of this film."" Acting was amazing and I found myself watching even the side characters closely to see how they would react to certain scenes. The visuals were phenomenal and beautifully made and designed. And let's not forget the animatronics. Each animatronic was characterized in a way that made the ghost kids inside them feel like...well, kids.The reveals of this movie were well done too. I felt myself feeling attached to Mike and Vanessa even from the first scenes of the screening. Both actors did outstanding in their roles and created such captivating scenes where all you could do as the audience is just sit in awe or suspense as their characters revealed more and more about what Freddys truly holds inside.As someone who enjoys the FNAF lore (No matter how insane it might be) this movie had me grinning from ear to ear the entire time. Even for its PG13 rating, there were some scenes where I felt my jaw drop and just watched in shock as characters were cut in half or completely mauled to death. This age rating gave plenty of room to explore that previously stated lore and build upon it in a new way that was both unique and similar to the games.All in all, If your a fan who's been waiting for this movie since 2016, or even a new fan who joined through Security Breach and are here for the ride, you'll love this movie. Go give it a watch, you wont be disappointed.",2023-10-27
"The Five Nights at Freddy's movie was incredible since it has very good special effects, also the characters are well made like the animatronics and the story is very related to what video games would be. This movie is a great gift for would-be fans of Five Nights at Freddy's. The movie is 80 percent recommended. Bit the movie is not addapted to many people because some critics are not going to understand well what the story would be and the plot will seem a bit strange to them. For me the movie was acceptable and what would be very enjoyable. I love this movie like the people that are fanatic of the game saga.",2023-10-27
"I saw this movie with my 16year old son. This is his review: (mine below his)
""Solid movie very close to the original games. Great cast for roles and solid acting. I also enjoyed seeing Matpat in the movie with a an iconic line! (and the other influencers that took part in the history). I would 100% recommend it for any FNAF fans. I hope for a sequel! ""Fathers review 7/10: I saw the movie without any prior knowledge about the history of the game. There is a clear buildup of the storyline and intro to the characters. It's a 'feel good horror movies' with not much surprise/ scares. But I enjoyed the movie (surprisingly) and the story drew me in. Great to get into the head of the main character Mike and his dreams. Well played!",2023-10-26
"If Scott had known that Fnaf would be as big as it is and had the story planned from the beginning, this movie is exactly what the first game would've been.The movie isn't perfect, I could only nitpick, but I think quite a lot of the hate it gets is very undeserved. Granted, if you were just a casual fan of the game or you just wanted a movie to watch, most people would say it's okay.The movie was a great start to a movie franchise that could be incredibly well made and enjoyable.On another note though, I think there should've been more scare. I like the happy fun vibe (lack of a better term) it put out, but there should've been more contrast to it.A note on that, there is some contrast, but it doesn't carry much to it. It does move the plot though.A lot of people expect the source material to get a lot more darker when it's put to another medium for some strange reason, I think this movie being put as PG-13 is perfectly fine. The games were never rated M, they were rated at worst 12+.To clarify on that, there should've been more jumpscare and suspense horror than gore horror.",2023-10-30
"This is a good movie if you don't 100 percent know the lore behind five nights at Freddy's or just want to go watch a scary movie, but for all the 5 nights at Freddy's fans out there, it was a little bit of a disappointment because they didn't follow the real storyline behind 5 nights at Freddy's very well there's a few scenes in the movie that did follow the lore behind it, but overall, they didn't really put much more into it, and some of the characters names we're not the same as the real names in the books and games and the bite of 87 was not really there and it didn't happen to Mike's younger brother.",2023-10-28
"This is actually a really good movie! Has some flaws but honestly it makes me want to keep watching it more and see what I have missed! I think it did miss on a few horror aspects and also maybe some but more blood or gore but honestly its really good. I even brought someone who doesn't know much about the franchise and he understood everything that was happening! Does this movie have flaws? Yes it does but honestly it's still good. Really hoping for the second film and be better! There's definitely potential! I also like the cameos too. The music, the casting, the story and among other things is really good.",2023-11-02
"So in my honest opinion after just watching this movie. The only complaint I have is the movie was a little to dark in most parts but after all it is in the horror genre so im fine with the extream darkness, but I dont see why people are hating on the movie as bad as they are doing? Do everyone not realize its PG-13? Hints the hard cuts from the deaths and the little language they have. Obviously the movie was directed toward younger people that was a fan of the movies back in the day. I was 17 when the first game released i am 26 now. The movie is directed and made just like every PG-13 movie that is in the horror genre. The fact everyone is hating on it clearly dont know what PG-13 movies are like cause they are either to old by this point. Its very sad how people ask for the movie and they got what they ask for just to talk bad about it. The guy spent all that money to have the movie made and as a person that doesnt play the FNAF games often or watch gameplay anymore I honestly really enjoyed the movie. Actually hope there might possibly a 2nd FNAF movie sometime in the future. Great work on the movie!Overall in as a fan of the horror genre I really enjoyed this movie. Dont get me wrong it wont be something i come back to over and over again but i will eventually most likely watch it again later in the future just not as often as most horror movies i've watched over the years but like i said, really enjoyed the movie and if you dont know the FNAF lore this is a great way to get a better understanding of the lore for the FNAF games. Myself i already knew the lore but this was a better way of reminding me and see how it actually would play out as a motion picture presentation than just reading about it on the internet.",2023-10-30
"I can assure you the movie is good, it actually had some super good cameos we were expecting/unexpected. It mightve seemed a bit odd but knowing the context of the Games, I'd say the outcome was actually decent! They had some infamous scenes, they had gore but not alot (because it's PG 13) and I think thats why it's getting low ratings. People were mad it wasn't like super bloody and death like but that's not what it needed, it needed context, to follow the games, and be accurate to the lore which they actually made it that way. Very solid 7-8/10. Hoping for more movies on the other games, especially more on the marionette backstory, something with golden freddy more, and if we're lucky we'll get something for every (or most) of the fnaf games.TL;DR: Was super overjudged, was a good watch, is kid friendly for the most part, gave some lore explanation/Made it easy to follow along for a newcomer, had good cameos, and was overall just a good piece of work for the game. Hope to see more movies some day! :)",2023-10-28
"What a blast!!! Can't believe they kept the lore from the game and made it so cinematic and scary. Director Emma Tammi continues her winning streak after her striking debut movie The Wind (now on Kanopy) with her signature visual flair and building sense of dread. The monsters are great and look FANTASTIC on the big screen. If you are a fan of the show or just fun horror movies in general this is a can't miss. Josh Hutcherson does a great job solidifying the horror and drama, glad to see him back on the big screen again. Look out for tons of fun cameos as well. Also make sure to stick around for the post credits scene.",2023-10-26
"If you are a fan of the games like I was in 2014 and on you will love this movie, it brought many aspects from the games and built on it in an amazing way. I really enjoyed this movie I could change a bit of the movie but it was amazing none the less. There are a few jumpscares in this film like the games and character design is amazing and spot on, they look like they came straight out of the games. If there would be one thing I could change it would be the length of the movie it definitely could have added an extra 20 minutes of film and still have me begging for more. Hopefully they make a sequel with more lore for this universe of the story. This film pushed the limits of PG-13 with the kills there were some off-screen kills but it was a perfect film for the fans of the games.",2023-10-28
"First of all, it is worth saying that my childhood is closely connected with FNAF. This movie allowed me to feel like a little girl again who was scared by animatronics for at least 2 hours. Actually, the movie is not worth 10 stars. But it doesn't deserve such hate either! The film, in my opinion, is somewhere on an 8. There is nothing ""Wow"" about it, but it is difficult to call it bad either.But, sitting in the cinema, I realized that I would definitely give it a 10. I've been waiting for it for several years and it simply amazed me. Yes, it doesn't fit the exact plot of the game (it's hard to believe that a film that has been in work for a long time will follow a plot that was sealed relatively recently). But I'm ready to dive into the new version of the FNAF universe. So, as a summary: the movie just blew me away. Hate is very undeserving.",2023-10-30
"Ever since I heard of this movie happening back in 2017 (that's the year I got into FNaF) I was asking myself ""when does it come out?"" Now, my inner 7-8 year old is very satisfied, this is what a horror movie should be, right amount of blood, scares, horror and almost everything about it was good. The only small thing I don't really like is some of the pacing, and when Vanessa was revealing Willian Afton, she never really got to the point. But other than that, this movie was near perfect, I especially like the part where Bonnie fell when they finished the fort, I thought that was funny, but yeah this movie is amazing with minor things like some pacing, but yeah. Definitely go watch it, one of the best Video Game adaptations out there.",2023-10-29
"I don't know why people hate this movie so much. I waited 5 whole years for this movie and the 5 years was worth it. The story, Plot was amazing in my opinion. If you have not watched the FNAF movie your missing out. But i do have to warn the people who have never played the games or just don't know the lore. Please watch some YouTube videos on the lore, that way where you wont have to be so confused. When i arrived at the theater i didn't expect much, This for me was the best movie of the year, And i know you may not think that, but just watch the movie if i had to promote the movie i would spend millions of dollars on billboards.",2023-10-29
Never really played the game but was always fascinated by the lore. The animatronics looked so good that's one thing I'll give them. Seeing Josh Hutcherson play as Mike was also nice. It's been a while since I seen him on the big screen but he played the role good. The directors also did a good job of staying true to the lore and incorporating the game theorist from YouTube who did a good job collecting all the lore and summarizing it in his videos. Looking forward to a potential sequel and prequel. One thing I will say so I would've liked to hear them talk about the bite of 87. That's one thing I was waiting to hear from them but besides that it was good. Wish it had insane jump scares but they can always add them to the next movies.,2023-10-28
"If this film was 3hours and if there was more fight with afton when trapped, it would be great but no great if great i put 1 stars but no vreat and i put 8 stars, Abi was really hot but why no put 3 hours film??? If 3 hours everyone would put 10 stars but no 10 stars, make fnaf 2 next year pls, if no fnaf 2 next year i kill myself, im being serious 😡, so with duzno postovanje duvaj te ga, again make 3 hour fnaf 2 pls. Goodbye cory was majestic tho but make 3 hour film or i kill myself, ok? Film was ok tho but make 3 hour next time, everyone was yelling CORY becusse CoryXKenshin was inna movie if you didint know. So make 3 hour film. Vladimir pantic ok...?",2023-10-27
"I loved the games, so I had high expectations. The atmosphere was definitely the best part of the movie and I'm impressed that CGI wasn't used.The biggest downside though is the acting and how all over the place the story is. It felt like the acting was a bit poorly delivered and I think it was partly due to the script.Was it a good watch? I mean a tad boring, if the acting felt more real and raw then I'd probably be more into it. But a lot of the acting was so off-putting to me. Some of the characters were randomly thrown in too which felt out of place.Atmosphere and the animatronics were the best part of the film, everything else was definitely mediocre.",2023-10-28
"It is a film that is well produced and has good filmography. What I did not like about this film is that it is not like Five Nights at Freddys. There are scenes that I did not like as much. I would have liked there to be more horror like any fnaf. It is also very well designed, the animatronic suits are very good. There is little action in this movie, I would have liked there to be more action scenes. If they had put more terror and they would have removed the scene where they play with the animatronics and brought out more of the childishness of this film. It would be a very good movie but I hope that for the next one they add more terror and less childishness as it is. All in all, the movie was very good, I loved everything, I just had doubts. 8/10.",2023-10-29
"This movie did have it's ups and it's downs but it was still overall enjoyable. The biggest problem in the movie I believe would be how certain things are paced/balanced, there are some moments that could have been cut shorter, brought in at another time, extended, or cut completely. The cast was great and all of the actors were perfect for their roles, cameos weren't overdone and their roles were done nicely.Now for the actually story and how it connects to the games is something that i've seen people complain about the most but in all honesty it was done well. They kept some of the most important characters and their personalities but there were some changes for their roles compared to the game which made it so that there were still some unexpected moments for fans who already know the games story. The relationships between the characters is probably one of the highlights of the movie for me however I wont go into it because that would contain spoilers. The animatronics look absolutely amazing but I felt they needed some more aggression as we had more cute moments with them than seeing them as they are in the game.And now for how the movie is for fnaf fans vs non fans. If you already know the games story and mainly like the franchise for that then you will like this movie, some iconic moments from the games are in the movie and you will see more of the characters than you ever have in game. If you don't know the games story than you might feel that certain parts are missing something, that there should have been more attention given to fleshing out those parts. Fans already know the story and the history behind these characters so it gives them a much stronger understanding where as the characters and dynamics may almost fall flat for non fans.For a critical rating I would give the movie a 5/10 for non fans and a 7/10 for those who are fans.I personally really enjoyed it and if you are someone who doesn't look at movies in much of a critical lense then you probably will enjoy it a lot as well.",2023-10-28
"It was really good for the amount of time it had in production and the amount of rewrites! I think the story was an interesting take on the lore of Five Nights at Freddy's. Was it super scary? No. Did I get startled a few times? Yes. Was it a cool concept? Obviously! We've been waiting for this movie for so long and we finally got it, which made my heart happy. We even got cameos from matpat and CoryxKenshin. If you're upset that Markiplier didn't make a cameo, he wasn't able to because he's filming for Iron Lung right now. Blumhouse and SteelWool have both expressed that they will try to get him in the next movie. That's why I'm reviewing, because I want this movie to have a good reception so we can see our favorite king in action in a new Five Nights at Freddy's experience. Please, I'm begging you all, leave a good review, even if it wasn't your favorite. Keep in mind that the movie isn't going to be ""lore accurate,"" no lore was really ever confirmed and the novels are the same way. Sure, it wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, but it was pretty darn good for what we have.",2023-10-27
"This movie is effectively exactly what most of the community was worried about when the movie was first suggested. This movie isn't scary, but it does follow an interesting part of the story. For starters, Abby is in interesting girl who is your average horror movie idiotic child. She does the exact wrong thing. The ""ghosts"" of the stolen kids want Abby, and Abby isn't even opposed to it. Vanessa (the police officer) is also ""important"" as in the fact that she literally knows EVERYTHING about this place but refuses to tell Mike anything until it's too late. This also follows the controversial ""dream theory"" that is widely debated amongst the FNaF community. Mike dreams about his brother who was lost several years ago on a camping trip. Vanessa tells Mike to eventually let it go. Mike, during the movie, took the security guard job to fight for custody of his sister, who is Abby. Vanessa threatens Mike saying that she will ""shoot him"" if he returns with Abby.To skip past the boredom, the movie ends with an (epic?) scene that involves Vanessa seeing her dad William Afton inside the animatronic costume. It was a heartwarming ending where all the animatronics come together to want to ""fight"" Afton.This basically proves that there will, in fact, be another movie in this series. When? I don't know. But the story is incomplete. It doesn't specifically imply there will be one, but it just makes sense, and Scott has been leaking it around.I give this movie a 6/10 as it looks great. The attention to detail is SUPERB. But beyond that, it's not scary, and it's evident that they were forced to the PG-13 rating due to the small amount of ""blood"" in the movie. Apart from 1 gory scene, it's evident this movie is made for children, and it should be viewed as such. If you're looking for a good cinematic experience, this is absolutely for you. I recommend watching it, but absolutely don't delve into the plot because you will be thoroughly disappointed.",2023-10-30
"I've been a Five Nights At Freddy's fan since I was 14. And the movie adaptation was good, the office where the player stays is designed differently compared to the first game. The movie starts out as Mike as a security officer at a mall, which made me think of Five Nights At Freddy's Security Breach, but if the pizzaplex was a Shopping Mall. Mike sees a boy standing in the middle of a busy mall and sees a man taking the boy, Mike runs over to the man and tackles him into the fountain and starts punching the man, the boy yells out ""daddy!"" Which draws a crowd and eventually leads to Mike being let go by the security company that he was working for. He visits the unemployment officer who turns out to be William Afton, but Mike doesn't know that his unemployment officer is a murderer and recommends Mike a job At Freddy's, Mike turns down the offer butt was given a card in case he changed his mind, that is all I will spoil of the movie.",2023-10-29
"I thought this movie would be dumb and bad but it was surprisingly really good. I'm not to big about five nights at Freddy's but I've played the first game and security breach and never really watched the lore and theory's despite that I didn't know much about the game in the story, but I thought the movie was amazing. Regardless, I would definitely recommend it and I think I might like it more than other people so I would overall as a community and citizen give it a seven out of 10 but out of my opinion I give it a nine I really recommend five nights at Freddy's it's at it's on Peacock for two dollars.",2023-10-29
"Definitely recommend if you're a FNAF fan and have a good understanding of the lore! I feel like it would be a better fit for new watchers if it started from the very beginning of the lore; when the pizzeria opened in the 80s. Also, almost every horror movie that starts in the 80s ends up being pretty good for the most part.When it comes to the gore I was honestly surprised we even got an ounce of gore in the movie. After seeing some reviews, you'd expect there to be absolutely nothing but there was a good amount to satisfy that.On another note, I really loved the performance of all of the characters. No bad acting in the film also really exciting to see Matthew Lillard!Such a fun watch, recommend the movie for the fans and recommend new watchers to watch a short lore video beforehand if you really want to get an understanding of the background of the movie!",2023-10-28
"The new Five Nights at Freddy's movie took me on an emotional journey that touched my heart and brought back memories of my childhood. It was a truly sentimental experience that left my inner child feeling like I was there with Freddy.This movie definitely brought the games to life on the big screen. The cast did such an amazing job too! And props to Jim Henson for making Freddy and the gang feel so real and cute!!!!Now, some parts of the plot left me a bit confused, but they also made me oddly understand the games a bit more.As the credits rolled, I couldn't help but get excited for what's next for movies. This movie really hit me in the feels and did some much needed healing for my inner child. 2014 year old me is so jumping for joy right now.If you are a fan of this franchise in anyway, please see this movie. I promise you will enjoy it.",2023-10-28
"I have been waiting for this movie genuinely for YEARS and it delivered amazingly. From the lore drops to the tiny easter eggs in the background and the twists, this is certainly a film that I will be watching multiple times!The plot was everything that I wanted out of a FNAF movie, slightly complex and rather heartbreaking. The constant theme of loss and guilt really made every single scene about Garratt hit even harder.The only issue I really have with it is the short length, but I don't see that as a reason to take it down a star!I also must mention the beautiful set design and builds of the animatronics - it made it all feel so real.10/10.",2023-10-27
"Gave it a 10 because it's genuinely a good movie...Not super scary but good twists...This movie was a simple story told well...Moves at a good pace, flows flawlessly, well acted...For those of us not familiar with the game, me, the nostalgia from a certain mouse with the last name of Cheese and his companions is enough to keep our attention...You love those machines yet they're creepy enough to freak you out...I enjoyed getting lost in the plot as it twisted frequently..Instead of actively trying to figure out the who or what, it kept my attention towards the what's next .. Would definitely watch this again!!!",2023-10-27
"After the 9-year wait for the FNAF movie, the reviews are in, the critics are mad, and the fans are disappointed, but before you go cancel your tickets to the movie, I will go through the positives. Matthew Lillard was great as William Afton, and the acting was great. The animatronics looked cool and accurate for the games, and the movie was very fun. Overall, it is great to watch if you are a FNAF fan, but for me, I had problems with it. The movie always talks down to its audience, even though they will dissect anything to understand. And I had so much story, but there was no conclusion to it, and it all amounted to nothing. But while the animatronics were cool, they felt too robotic, and it missed the uncanny valley part that made it scary. So now that we have all that out of the way, it's time for me to tell you how Blumhouse can learn from their mistakes, but first let me tell you how the second FNAF movie should start. After William afton was dragged away and left to die he turns his head to a tray of purple fluid trapped in a glass vile he reaches his hand out to grab the mysterious purple fluid and he injects it into himself then he cracks out a laugh before crack he grabs his neck gasping for air while the spring lock closes in on his neck then the spring locks start to close in on more areas and then he falls to the floor and blood starts to stain the suit he was in before he finally falls on the floor and dies then the animatronics walk back to the positions they were in with each step becoming more human like and unpredictable than before then they blink and what was one robotic eyes became a void with a white dot in the middle of it showing how the ghost kids have taken full control of the animatronics and now there lives are like the mysterious purple fluid trapped in a small jar and locked away from the real world meanwhile a new guy with the name of Jeremy Fitzgerald ended up in the hospital with bandages around his head but he constantly kept getting flashbacks of him trying to stop the animatronics but there main weakness didn't work on it that time a then he starred at the bright speck left over in the dark void in cupcake and Chickas eyes before cupcake launched at him and biting him damaging his frontal lobe then Michael afton gets introduced and after accidentally being the cause of the death of his younger brother he needs seeks to find redemption for his brother. But with William Afton out of the picture, Henery Emily interviewed Michael Afton, and he got the job. Now, Mike Schmidt Jeremy Fitzgerald and Michael Afton have to find a way to stop the animatronics while also uncovering the mysteries behind Freddy Fazzbear's pizzaria's Michael Afton tries to survive the next 5 nights at Freddy's. And that is how I think the FNAF 2 movie could improve on its predecessor.",2023-10-28
"As a longtime fan of the FNaF franchise, from way back when the first game came out, I can say I truly enjoyed this take of the story. Yes, it is a modified version of the story we know so far from the games, but it had me interested throughout, and left me wanting an immediate continuation.The connection between Mike and Abby felt real and seeing Mike's struggles was rough, the acting from Josh Hutcherson for that role is incredible, and so is the acting from Matthew Lillard in the role of ""Steve Raglan""The animatronics were absolutely done justice, they are implemented so well into this movie.Their designs are perfect, and the set design for the pizzeria is incredible.If you are a fan of the franchise, there will be something extra for you in this movie, from obscure references of old FNaF hoaxes to nods towards certain theories, to references to more current FNaF media, etc etc.I believe that as long as you go in not expecting a 1:1 retelling of the story as we believe it to be from the games, as a fan, you will love this movie!",2023-10-27
"The movie is amazing, the reviews of the people saying the movie is trash is absolutely wrong! They're just mad because they want to always say something negative about everything. Don't listen to them!!! The movie is great and it is perfect where it is and I recommend it! I love it and it's one of the best movies I've ever watched, I'm hoping for more the ending does look like a sequel but I love everything about it so much! Thanks fnaf! Keep up the great work and for those who are reading this remember those bad star reviews are totally wrong don't listen to them, trust me this movie will be one of your favorites.",2023-10-30
"I just finished this movie and I gotta say, they hit the nail on the head with the fan service! So many references and some cameos that make you go, ""They did that? Yes!"" If you're a fan of this the FNAF series, you gotta check it out. If you not, you can still expect a well executed horror movie that I think even a kid could watch if they already watch/read stuff like Goosebumps. The acting was good, especially by the younger actors. Nothing felt forced. It leaves you feeling like you got what you wanted and now you want more. This movie was made by fans, for fans, and with help from the creator from the source material (which is hard to find).",2023-10-31
"Gets the important things right. The animatronic characters are very well realized by the Jim Henson Creature Shop and the emotional beats of the story hit the mark.The back story has its charms and the transfer to film is accomplished smoothly. Some characters lack depth (notably the primary antagonist). This is accentuated by some infrequent moments of clumsy writing... but these flaws can be forgiven as it never strays from being sincere and entertaining.Josh Hutcherson delivers an engaging performance as the protagonist. The supporting cast are decent. We can probably chalk the odd weak line delivery up to production schedules.Given its moderate budget and considering the extent to which it achieves its ambitions, it punches above its weight. Most importantly... it was just bloody good fun. 8/10.",2023-10-27
"If the movie had been longer and featured more interesting plot points (like more William Afton moments or dead kids), it would have been better. The animatronics look good, but too manicured after all these years. The music is good, especially pleased with The Living Tombstone in the movie credits. The pizzeria itself looks atmospheric, capturing the atmosphere of the pizzerias of the time quite well. Along with that, though, comes the question of the time frame. It's unclear how much time has passed since the pizzeria closed. But that's a quibble. The movie itself is not super scary, in some moments even funny (the moment where animatronics helped to build a fortress to the sister of the main character). In general, the movie is more fanatical and purely for fans, with a lot of references and moments from the original games and books. If I could, I'd give it a 6.5, but so a strained 7.",2023-10-27
"I have finally watched the five nights at Freddy's movie! And... it could have been better. The story wasn't very strong, they should have brought Spring Bonnie sooner and established him as the villain. Sure, it was fun in some parts, but it's five nights at Freddy's movie. But I did like a lot of the little easter eggs in it and Mat Pat being in the film was crazy! I loved that part.The animatronics looked very good, and the pizzeria also looked very good. Production wise it's great. But it wasn't scary at all, I wish there was 10 min more of William Afton, and the acting was meh. Also, there are quite a few plot holes. But overall a 7/10.",2023-10-28
"This movie is clearly a love letter to the fans of this franchise. As an original member of the fandom I've been waiting for this movie for about nine years, so to say I was excited is an understatement-- but I was also terrified. If it wasn't good, I wasn't sure how I was going to react. But it was everything I could have hoped for. It was just the right amount of gore, easter eggs, existing lore, and new story that made it feel so well done! It was also an overall entertaining story and the performances were stellar! I may not know much from a technical standpoint, but from the point of view of a fan of the franchise it was absolutely worth the wait!",2023-10-27
"9 years in the making, and it is here! There's a lot of pros and cons mixed in together.Pros: The set is so colorful and lively, the costumes are straight from the games, and actors are really solid and feel natural in the world.Cons: The screenplay is okay, Scott is better at writing stories in his games (despite it being a mess of a lore that was solved by a few people) and the books. The human characters were boring at some points, and scenes felt longer than they needed to be.It felt like he was in a deadline and he tried his best. Everything about this movie is solid. It is separated from the video games lore, and it is meh at some points, and the jump scares are jump scares, the horror elements aren't too bad, but would've been better. This movie is really good, and I believe Scott will have the time to make the second movie better if this one ends up being successful. (Which it will)",2023-10-27
I honestly thought this movie was very good and it surprised me on how much I liked it because of the sheer amount of disapproval it was getting and if you ask me it really just depends on if your a five nights at Freddy's fan. (I'm not a five night at Freddy's fan but I understand the back story) This movie had some good plot twists and unexpected moments like for example when it was revealed that Vanessa was Williams daughter. But apart from the people giving it bad reviews and saying it was a disappointment I really think it's worth giving a go if your a horror movie fan and enjoy that spooky feeling and sitting on the edge of your seat vibe.,2023-10-28
"This is a great movie to watch with friends and definitely has a weird and interesting plot twist. It is important to note that the movie is not canon to the games and wraps a lot of the games into the movie. We have the fnaf 1 characters, golden freddy as the fnaf 2 design, and Vanessa. There are a lot of great easter eggs such as the Ella doll and matpat. There were some predictable moments such as hiw everyone knew the movie was going to end with the springlock failure and the springlocks are simplified with just being around the stomach. Other than this, it was a great way to pay tribute to the games and I can't wait for the next two movies.",2023-11-01
"Listen the movie itself hyped me up to watch it since it's fnaf and I have been playing the games since I was a kid, yes the game lore and book lore are different but they had an opportunity to put the game lore into a cinematic masterpiece where we could of seen william killing the kids or a more Brutual springlock scene, I'd even want to see the bite of 83 because it is truly iconic and alot of people really like Michael afton as a character and I feel like we should of been introduced to Michael afton, not an entirely rip off Michael who isn't even Michael afton yet looks and has so many parallels to him and don't get me started on Vanessa? I LOVED her in the movie but the one thing that didn't make sense is her being Williams daughter, the movie was a solid 7/10 I'd say I enjoyed it but I really hope they bring more to the table in fnaf movie 2 if that's even being made....",2023-10-29
"I've been a huge fnaf fan since the games came out and have kept up on all the lore, so you can take a guess on how disappointed I was when I learned how much of the lore they changed. The storyline made no sense honestly and was paper-thin. The best scenes to me were with Matpat and Cory honestly. I was so hyped for this movie, I didn't even watch the trailer because I wanted to be completely blind.If you wanna see this movie, go ahead. I don't recommend watching it in theaters though because it would be a massive waste of hard earned money.Overall, could have been worse but definitely not as good as I expected nor as some people are making it out to be.",2023-10-29
"I love the movie, and please rate this as a higher, just ignore the peoples that they don't like it, just watch and enjoy it, and i really wish this will get a higher rate and the audience will love it i hope this will be like what the rate of the Super Maria, lower on the rotten tomato but higher on the audience, so please rate it, don't rate it lower, don't make the fans sad or disappointed for the rate even me, so please and enjoy the movie, hope you have a good day and by the way I ALWAYS COME BACK, i hope there will be more FNAF Movies like fnaf 2, fnaf 3, fnaf 4, fnaf sl, fnaf 6, and more hehe.",2023-10-27
"The Fnaf movie was a movie that I had been anticipating for a long time and I'm happy to say it did not disappoint, either than a few small plot holes the Fnaf movie delivers a faithful adaptation of the games so many people fell in love with and has plenty of Easter eggs and little detailed that fans will adore, though if you are not familiar with the games or the convoluted lore surrounding them you may find this movie slightly confusing and random at some points, although this movie wasn't made for people unfamiliar with the source material, this is clearly and truly a film made for the fans of the original games.",2023-10-27
"As someone who has been a fan since the very start, this movie was very satisfactory. Noticing all the details and getting the references was amazing. The antagonists weren't very compelling, but the protagonists luckily were. The twist at the end didn't hit quite as hard as it should've, and the plot doesn't come together well in the end. The beginning was fun and interesting, and the connection between Mike and Abby is genuine and great to see. I loved the conversations between Mike and Vanessa as they were deep, revealed more about the characters, but didn't reveal too much. The horror wasn't scream-inducing, but some moments were filled with tension and genuinely terrifying. The balloon boy jumpscares were my favourite. Realising Abby was in danger because of the same animatronics she thought were her friends was interesting.I think all FNAF fans should watch this movie, but non-fans should wait till it's out of theatres.",2023-10-26
"I'm glad to say that this film had my attention on every scene, this film was a lover letter to fans and hopefully got to people who would understand the film itself. And I feel Josh, Elizabeth, and Piper did really well portraying the characters they were cast, especially Mathew Lillard.The animatronics were one-to-one recreations of the originals from the games and I would like to thank Jim Henson's creature shop for that. But I will probably say that the only criticism that I have for this film is that the pacing felt a bit off at times and felt that some of the characters should've been more fleshed out if the Movie's runtime was longer. Kat Conner and Christian Stokes I felt had more potential if their characters had more screen time. But the story written/directed by Emma Tammi and Scott Cawthon was phenomenal, from the character interactions and cinematography was really well done.Overall I think this movie is really good, and I recommend this to fans.",2023-10-28
"This movie was incredible, I went to see it on the 26th with a group of friends (one of them I've known since 4th grade) and we had an absolute blast!! This is definitely a movie for the fans, you also need to understand that it is completely different lore from the books and games. Yes, it does have book lore, but it's it's own thing. Like how Vanessa was the daughter of William Afton, there is bound to be something with that, and they'll most likely expand on it in the second and third films, go into this movie with an open mind and have an amazing time!My only critique is that the ""I always come back"" felt a bit rushed, and I wished that it kept most of the scenes and didn't have open plot holes. Hopefully they fix it in the second movie!!",2023-10-29
"This movie was absolutely incredible.It was so faithful to the games, with references to the books, the games, with amazing plot twists, and unexpected changes that left fans like myself shocked too! This movie changes some of the lore in big ways, but does it in a wonderful way that feels like it was meant to be. The movie has wholesome parts, childish scenes, organic family drama, wonderful scary moments, and mysteries we have to wait for the sequels to see! And for fans of the series, with a close eye, you can see huge revelations to come hidden right underneath your noses! Scott did a wonderful job, and the acting was incredible. There's also many references to the YouTube's and influencers that made this series so successful in the first place. I loved this movie.",2023-10-28
"Not a perfect movie but still enjoyable. The movie isn't lore accurate (like the part when Vanessa reveals she's William's daughter) but I wasn't expecting it to be.Most of the visuals and little details in the movie are brilliant and it's great fun for fans of FNAF to look out for and I myself had some fun spotting them.Unfortunately this movie was lacking in the horror aspect and the movie felt more like I was watching a thriller. Too few gore and bloody scenes and It could have had more of William Afton in the movie. I also wish there was a better backstory for most of the characters like the missing children and Mike. Overall, it's a decent movie but I certainly wouldn't call it a horror movie as it's not scary in the least.My favourite part was when the Living Tombstone song was in the end credits. I don't understand why this movie has such a high rating in the UK.5.3 stars.",2023-10-29
"Despite the fact that calling this movie, a "" horror"" movie was a lie, it's still a great piece of film! It's a fantastic tribute to original game and book series with a bunch of Easter eggs for fans. The movie is not lore accurate in the slightest, however from what I've gathered, it's a great option to introduce new people to the series. You can see the rise of popularity of games, and movies after the movie came out, people are onto fnaf again! I personally enjoyed the film quite a bit ( I may be biased, I was interested in the series since 2016). The dynamic between characters is wery well done, same goes for the looks of abandoned pizzeria itself, and the infamous animatronics. Overall I recommend giving it a watch, even if you are not a fan of the series.",2023-10-29
"Personally the movie was kinda fast paced and it felt like they were trying to cram a lot of stuff in with a short amount of time, It was kinda lacking emotion and wasn't as scary as I thought it would be but I didn't expect to much because the Fnaf game is mostly jumpscares and doesn't have to much horror in it besides the story of the animatronics. I did still enjoy watching the movie with my friend and liked the twists in it aswell as how good the pizzeria looked, the twist of Vanessa being William aftons daughter was pretty shocking to me and my friend aswell as the job employer being William afton.",2023-10-30
"Soo good, I love this movie. The intro was amazing too. This is definitely for the fnaf fans, others can still watch it, but the fans would definitely enjoy it more.There are scenes that will shock you, some that are a bit corny but I still love them. If you are a die hard fnaf fan PLEASE WATCH THIS MOVIE!!This is definitely one of my favourites, it has many jump scares(like the game) but not much gore. It isn't EXTREMELY scary but it definitely gives you some frights! I would do anything to see this movie for the first time again. The wait was worth it, I'm so happy that this movie was created and I would definitely recommend it! Hopefully we will get a second or even more movies.",2023-10-28
"This movie was great! Clearly its made for the fans of the series, but I still think others can have a somewhat fun time with it. I think Mike, Vanessa, and Abby were amazing! The design's of the animatronics and the practical effects were amazing! The set designs were top tier pared with the lighting! The cameos and easter eggs are just amazing! I do think nostalgia and cameos might have been over used but honestly I don't mind, Matpat, Cory, Sparky, , Balloon Boy, and Dream Theory were just some of the amazing details fan will love. This movie is far from perfect though, Matthew Lillard was done extremely dirty with the amount of screen time he had, but when he was on screen he was just amazing! The movie also wasn't to scary, there were some parts here and there (Spring Bonnie) but for the majority it was kinda underwhelming. The actual lore of the franchise was actualy pretty accurate, I wish the Afton Family part of FNaF wasn't just totally abandoned. A big thing I do like is, believe it or not, the animatronics being nice (a lot of peoples biggest complaint is when the animatronics were nice) is actually completely canon to the lore. In The Forth Closet ( the third book in the novel trilogy) a lot of the stuff with the animatronics being nice happens in the book, including how they defeat William. I loved the opening scene with the 8-bit and the credits with the original FNaF song by The Living Tombstone. This movie is an absolutely amazing movie in my eyes even if it wasn't totally perfect. I love FNaF and think this was a great start to a new beginning for the franchise.",2023-10-28
"""Five Nights at Freddy's is an awesome movie, totally catering to the fans, but if you're not into FNAF, it might leave you a bit lost. It's basically a big hug to FNAF lovers, and I was totally wowed by how they brought those animatronics to life! Thank you Scott and the whole Production Team! <3. The film is a testament to the immense love poured into it. The storyline, while slightly confusing, was exceptionally well-written and performed. The abundance of visual and audiovisual Easter eggs added an extra layer of excitement. The casting was spot-on, and the actors' performances were outstanding. However, I was a bit disappointed that Freddy's song, which was featured in the trailers, was missing.""",2023-10-27
"8/10. It's a good movie, it wasn't perfect, I admit that as a FNAF fan, but it was entertaining and fun to watch. Everyone can see that the crew, Blumhouse & Scott Cawthon put a lot of hard work into this movie and even used actually robots designed by the Jim Henson company. Looks of course aren't the only things I look for in media. The story was pretty nice, the lore in tbis movie had a few changes that differed from the game lore but at least it still felt like FNAF. There were no tonal whiplashes, the villain felt realistic, and of course, the characters and settings were lovely to witness. I have just a few nitpicky criticisms here and there but nonetheless I think the pros outweigh the cons in this movie. Perhaps a bit more screentime with William Afton & a few more horror elements would have me rate this 10/10, but hey, nothing's perfect and I'm fine with it. Lots of easter eggs and cameos fans will love to enjoy. There were some scenes that genuinely scared me and even a twist that even I didn't expect. I would definitely watch it many more times. I especially loved the dream sequences Mike has in the movie, these I feel really made the movie stand out. I can't wait to see if they do better in the second and third movie. Either way, everyone has their own opinion and I've learned not to let other people dictate what I like or shouldn't like because it's up to ourselves to figure that out. (Screw the critics). Have a Faz-errific day!",2023-10-28
"I wasn't going in thinking this was going to be anything that special, but it ended up being a genuine good movie. It is underwhelming and 100% could've been alot scarier but i really enjoyed the story and the cast did a really good job acting. The designs of the characters are also really good, There were moments where you were not too sure if the animatronics were about to slice Smitcht's head off and the portrayal of having a kid in the movie makes you really worry if the kids about to get hurt whenever she goes off and does something really stupid. It really plays with your feelings and its wonderful, and the reveal of afew things made the whole movie story make alot of sense, especially with the movie probably being pretty accurate with the law, even though the movie is a whole separate story, its just nice to see that they atleast put some attention to detail.The animatronics are obviously based of the original FNAF. But the actual setting, looks alot closer to a original FNAF mixed in the FNAF 3 with the 1 door and the vent. I think i would have enjoyed seeing it alot closer to the original FNAF design but having it like this probably makes it alot better anyways.But yeah i really enjoyed this movie and i would recommend it to you if you knew anything about the franchise.Also the reaction from people in the movie theatres makes it 10x more worth it, youd have people screaming and cheering, theres no one left out.",2023-10-27
"Good for fans, probably better for new fans that dont know the lore. The animatronics were spot on, i think the problem was the game lore didnt match the movie and because of that people expected more horror, if there was a second movie i think the age rating should go up and make it more similar to the games then it would appeal more to the people that grew up with fnaf. The story itself was okay but as stated before it strayed away from the original plot of the games by mixing characters and changing their backstories , for example venessa . This movie seemed to be primarily based on fnaf 1, and vanessa from security breach was in it? And was also aftons daughter? Just a weird change in my opinion thats why it is probably better for new fans that arent hoping for accurate lore.",2023-10-27
"The biggest complaint I hear about this movie is the level of gore featured in the film. But you gotta remember it's a ""kids"" movie, and the games are really all jumpscares. At one point a girl's body gets chomped in half which was more than I was expecting! The usual body horror was mostly just blood & off screen killings.Lots of little lore easter eggs which was fun to try and find, and I'm glad it featured other animatronic suits instead of just the main 4.Matthew Lillard does a great job at playing the villian as per usual! And I'm happy the animatronics had a consistent look that followed the style of the first game. I loved that they were also practical effects instead of making them out of CGI. CGI is way overused nowadays, it should be used as an enhancement or for the little details.Overall, we were pretty happy with the film and how it turned out! Very fun and enjoyable, would definitely watch a sequal if they decide to make one.The only complaint I have is the red eyes when the animatronics get quirky. At least they gave the ""white dot"" eyes to springtrap. It made his character scarier.",2023-10-28
"The movie felt nostalgic, it was amazing, maybe not the best cinematic masterpiece but the feeling of it was amazing, was it scary? A little, it has some chilling scenes like the one with max, it has a lot of funny moments and it just felt too wholesome seeing our favorite fnaf YouTubers in the movies not to mention the credit music being the fnaf song by the living tombstone, this movie was made with love, and the Vanessa twist was really something, I hope it gets the recognition it deserves, we might get a second movie who knows? In the end a great movie but I gotta admit that the foxy kid jumpscare was kinda lame, it didn't hit me.",2023-10-28
"Ok so I watched this on the day of release in the UK and I'm gonna be honest, it wasn't that good in my opinion. 😭The acting was really good. Josh, Piper and Elizabeth did an amazing job. I would have liked to see more of Matthew, but oh well. Loved the cameos too. The animatronics are absolutely gorgeous as well. But I don't know, they just weren't scary at all. They seemed pretty cuddly 💀Erm, the story was ok? I was a bit bored half the time. It was a pretty generic story and any plot twists could be seen from a mile away.I think sentimental fans will like it more than people that are like really invested in the lore and such. If you go into the movie expecting a really well-crafted, scary, gorey movie, then you'll be disappointed. But if you keep your expectations low or are just happy to finally get the movie we've been waiting so long for, you'll probably like it 💪 (that sounds so bad omg).If you aren't a fan of horror, I think you'll probably enjoy it more than someone that regularly consumes the genre. It's not scary at all. 💀 Though, I suppose that's to be expected when the age rating is 15/16. Still, I think even that is pushing it. Would've been fine as a 12/13+ imo.",2023-10-27
"Well I'm fan FNAF game series from 2014 begin until now my opinions about movie show after watched.For me this is a nice movie show, I understand concept about the movie but not actually I'm expected some plots is changes from the original stories and times line explaining a little bitMy personal preference this show is not too scary but still got goosebump mood sometimes.Likes - The casters is really good Matthew Lillard is the great actor,
I liked when Springtrap show up the move the way he acting it's was really good.Soundtracks is thing I liked in this movie the animatronics parts sound OUH that's really nice.Creatives is the almost accurate thing the places and colors shade or tone is good that make you feel the true FNAF vibe.Disliked - Um I don't want to talk much longer, I've list of my opinions1. Times line
2. Fast
3. Need more time to explains and show more of story line.That's all of my opinions about Five Night At Freddy's Movie.",2023-10-28
"Amount of detail, the designs and story is very good overall. It was funny and was very much like the Fazber Pizzeria Simulator if we talk about vibe. So many ealster eggs and easy to understand plot. I don't understand people who expected gore and constant jumpscares. It's FNAF. The games themselves were never brutal, but they made up for it with the atmosphere and atmosphere that made them feel dangerous. The movie knew when to be funny and when to maintain suspense. The camera shots were wonderful and it's clear that the game creator himself considers this film a congratulations to his fans. And very well. Not every movie has to appeal to everyone to be good (e.g. Marriage Story is an example of a movie that didn't impress everyone but is very good). Overall, a good adventure film with horror elements. If I had to complain about something, it would be that it was marketed as very dark horror film.",2023-10-28
"I saw the movie yesterday AND I LOVED IT!! I've been waiting for it since 2015, when I was 7 and I cannot say that I am disappointed AT ALL. It's everything I was hoping for. People who say, that this movie is horrible, to me, are just delusional, but that's their opinion. I think it was fantastic, the animatronics, the storyline, the props etc were all what I was hoping for and more, especially the animatronics! They looked perfect. I especially loved the springlock scene. I think it had the right amount of gore, if we are being realistic, William's line was said perfectly and the whole build up and tention was ideal. Good job Scott!! 👏👏",2023-10-28
"Fun movie overall, the hensen company knocked the animatronics out of the park perfectThe only big issue i had with the movie, was it tried to be 2 different plots and had no real chance to finish any of them off satisfyingly enough, 1. Family drama 2. Horror, as far as the horror aspect goes it was terrible basically dropped it halfway through.Hiding the gore and the attacks besides one or two was such a bad move, we see a kid constantly act like william but wasnt one of the animatronics but wait he's foxy, oh wait he's not without a single explanation?I mean person chopped in half then family fort building shortly after that was such a weird choice, i get what IGN meant by too much plot the animatronics were not important to a movie based on them, too much mike and his issues he fears kidnapping but fall's asleep with his kid behind him, in a sketchy broken down building made no sense for his apparent vigilant caring character up until that point.William afton arguably the single big bad shows up in the last 20 minutes of a near 2hr movieKid ghosts can somehow manipulate dreams, doors and electricity but get controlled by a human dude who killed them, what sense doe's that make?.Not a terrible watch but 15 minutes feels like 30 in this.",2023-10-28
"If you're an old fnaf fan such as myself you may feel less inclined to enjoy this movie. The lore was off and I believe it resonated more with the books than the games. But it's beautifully crafted, great acting, great sets and a good and insightful plot. I think how different it is opens it to new opportunities, I would recommend it especially for new viewers. It's not too grotesque or full of gore, which some may find good or bad - but there are definitely a few scenes with some good death if that's what you're into. There is definitely room for improvement but otherwise it's a good movie I think.",2023-10-28
"I don't know what I was thinking
Leaving my child behind
Now I suffer the curse and now I am blind
With all this anger, guilt and sadness
Coming to haunt me forever
I can't wait for the cliff at the end of the river
Is this revenge I am seeking?Or seeking someone to avenge me?Stuck in my own paradox, I wanna set myself free
Maybe I should chase and find
Before they'll try to stop it
It won't be long before I'll become a puppet
It's been so long
Since I last have seen my son lost to this monster
To the man behind the slaughter
Since you've been gone
I've been singing this stupid song so I could ponder
The sanity of your mother
I wish I lived in the present
With the gift of my past mistakes
But the future keeps luring in like a pack of snakes
Your sweet little eyes, your little smile is all I remember
Those fuzzy memories mess with my temper
Justification is killing me
But killing isn't justified
What happened to my son? I'm terrified
It lingers in my mind
And the thought keeps on getting bigger
I'm sorry my sweet baby, I wish I've been there
It's been so long
Since I last have seen my son lost to this monster
To the man behind the slaughter
Since you've been gone
I've been singing this stupid song so I could ponder
The sanity of your mother.",2023-10-28
"As a life long fan, this movie is everything i had wanted. Obviously its not lore accurate and isnt an easy watch for someone whos never seen the franchise before. The anamatronics look amazing and the acting was mostly spot on (with the odd slightly cringey line)Honestly id recommend watching this to pretty much anyone as long as you understand its NOT LORE ACCURARE. If you understand this before watching you will at the very least enjoy the expereince that this mobie has to offer.Im more than happy to see tbis movie honour the legacy of this great series and treat it with the respect it deserves.",2023-10-28
"I personally loved the Five Nights at Freddy's movie. Everything was fantastic, and there are tiny details that fans (like myself) definitely are going to enjoy. The animatronics were definitely my favorite part, with how expensive and fluid as a robot with their movements can get. Also there's thankfully no ""We are FNaF"" scene so if anyone is worried about that you need to worry no more. My two only complaints are that when Mike gets attacked by Cupcake that it's very cheesy looking but I guess that happens when you m use zero CGI in a movie, and that the Springlock Failure scene lasted a bit longer and had a smidgin more gore. But besides those two complaints, this movie is all around the best movie and definitely what the fans asked for. Go watch the movie it was definitely worth the eight year wait!",2023-10-27
"Big FNAF Fan here. Just watched the movie and all I can say is that it's alright. Video games turned into movies usually suck but this was not so bad. I just dislike the fact that it was kind of rushed, especially at the end. I really loved the cameos and Easter eggs though.This movie was more like a gift to us, FNAF Fans. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone that wants to watch a ""scary"", ""gorey"" movie. The best I can describe this is that it's a movie that you watch for fun and then forget about it instantly. Actually, as weird as this sounds, I'd like to see a sequel. Maybe a sequel could fix everything and not only explain the lore further but also add some more scary scenes. Not bad but could've been better.",2023-10-28
"It was a really fun movie, but i kinda wish it followed the FNAF lore a little more and got character names right like Afton's daughter and other kids etc. I also really loved how the animatronics were 100% real animatronics or costumes, no computer generated effects were added in terms of them. (Except for im assuming scenes were cupcake starts jumping around) The acting and characters were all great!! The soundtrack was wonderful as well, infact the first intro of the movie sounds almost exactly like the tetris theme song from the 80's. (Freddy Fazbear's Pizzaria was popular in that same time, so its a cool little detail.)
But yes everything was great!! Its a really fun movie, fnaf fan or not (although it might be helpful to gain a little bit of context on the animatronics and william afton etc)",2023-11-02
"This movie was its own genre, really. I watched it, and let me say..It was GREAT. As a fan of the series, it really did a good job at explaining the lore that at one period of my life took three weeks to understand, and this sums it up in 3 sentences. Really great movie, acting really good, and the story is amazing. I suggest you watch it. It isn't so much scary, although at some parts it made me jump, but is more funny and almost suspenseful. It. I really loved the character design and the animatronics are really well designed. Great movie, and at least a 9.3 stars. So get up, buy tickets, and watch it. Like right now.",2023-10-28
"Personally I loved the theme and the way they presented the story, with so much community refences, I can't forget about the ballon boy scenes that just scared me, the whole plot between Mike and the animatronics made a very good combination with Afton controlling the animatronics, the post credits song of the living tombstone made everything even better, bringing up so much nostalgic memories of every game.I still think Scott Cawthon made a very good job to that franchise, and blumhouse addapted perfectly for a movie, maintaining a lot of the concistency of the games and lore while still bringing a lot of funny and cool scenes.",2023-10-28
"Ive loved fnaf since 2014 when it came out when i was just 10 years old in the fourth grade, i remember hearing about sparky for the first time ever, then seeing him referenced onscreen is amazing! I remember when it was just a rumor on the playground at school that a movie was being made, then it finally officially was announced, and after years of waiting we ACTUALLY got a movie! And not to mention freddy and the gang look absolutely fantastic! I love the way they look and i wouldnt change a thing about the movie as it is, i love the games and i love the scares but whats been left out mostly of all the games was the story this whole time, and im thrilled to get to see it get pieced together in real time in this movie! I hope we get a fnaf 2 and 3, it would be amazing. I think the gore was just perfect and im really surprised they were able to get away with so much for a pg13 rating! Its for sure this movie is a love letter to its dedicated fans of the games/books. Thank you scott for making my childhood 🙏",2023-10-28
"I didn't displease the film itself, I admit that I expected a little more, being a fan of the video game series literally since the release of the first Five Nights at Freddy's. I absolutely wasn't expecting a slapdash copy of the first game, actually being a film in my opinion it's right to make everything more cinematic.Overall the characters have good characterization, the protagonist is the one who stands out the most, Josh Hutcherson gave us a good performance, but in general the whole cast.What worried me most about this film was perhaps that the ""magic"" of Fnaf was being lost, what made Fnaf unique in its genre, and in my opinion that happened a little.To explain better I would have to go into detail but since the film was released a few days ago I don't want to give spoilers.Speaking more on the technical side, he has good direction and you can see that he had fun creating the right setting, also for the various Eastern eggs, the music, etc.I found the photography particularly bright except in the dark moments.What can I say about the animatronics, in my opinion they are really well made and faithful to the game.Basically promoted film.I recommend everyone go and see it, even those who don't know or have never played video games, the film is absolutely understandable even without it.",2023-10-29
"Well the movie was solid, some moments were really cool, appreciate that the animatronics are made to be big and heavy. But it does mess with the ground understanding of the canon, but I personally separate it from the games.It really lacks the R-rating for the gory-ness, and because of that some scenes just weren't as powerful.Either way it sets up a really good following and I'm hoping that the movies will meet a bigger narrative.And If the movies are following games, then the next one should be setting up for fazbear fright and that'd be cool by itself.Solidly good watch, but it's not perfect.",2023-10-27
"The film doesn't take itself too seriously but can get spooky when needs be, filled with easter eggs for the long time fans, who remembers sparky?. Not as scary as I'd thought but still a delight to experience the pizzareia in full glory.The movie itself stuck to core lore eg the five kids, what animatronics would do in game, for example chica in the kitchen, foxy bolting down the hall and bonnie in the janitors closet, but mixed it up with new story elements and some scenes that closely resembled the books.Overall I found the movie to be a delight, definitely not what I was expecting but great non the less, would recommend watching to experience for yourself.Can't wait to see where the next movie will take us, after all, He always comes back....",2023-10-28
"The writers and directors had a big challenge taking such a huge franchise and turning it into a movie but they definitely did they research and understood what they had to do. The FNAF games have never had a consistent plot and things that are understood to be fact are later proven wrong in a later installment. There also multiple instances of parallel story telling with almost the same story but different characters. This allows for deep theorizing for the fans. I love that the movie doesn't follow the plot established in the games or the books. It builds a new world for us to explore the same characters we love. If it was just a re-creation of the games, it would have finalized certain theories and invalidated others. Part of the fun of FNAF is never truly knowing what's happening. It let all of the fans experience being surprised when watching the movie!",2023-10-31
"The movie itself was pretty good, though the reason I decided to give it a 6/10 is due to the fact that I was wishing it to be more bloody or just a bit more gore because the video game and lore kinda explains how much blood there is too happen. Secondly I found some of the scenes a little cringey, or I could say ""kid friendly"" for a horror movie, it was a bit unexpected; Not what I was looking for being a 2016 fnaf fanatic. But I do think they were great with the set design, the costumes, etc.Now, I have seen many videos of people saying what age you should be able to see it. In my personal opinion I would say 13 or 14+ would be best due to some scenes that can be a little gruesome but not horrible.Overall, this movie is not exactly my expectations, but I did have a blast seeing it!",2023-10-30
"Overall an enjoyable movie. The start of the movie was kinda meh but still okay. It takes a bit too long to get to the action. When the action starts it wasnt as good as people expected, of course we cannot ask for as good quality of action as in the lore or games what not. Chrachters were good and good acting was also a big plus. Animatronics got a little too little screentime. The biggest letdown of the movie that we didnt see purple guy aka William Afton or ""springtrap"". The legendary I always come back was a bit of a letdown but definetly not as bad then it could have been. The movie was a bit confusing but at the halfway the plot was clear. A bit boring at times but overall not a bad movie. The movie received too much of negative reviews. The movie is amazing for the fans for the ""pro"" people not so good. I hope this review helps out even a little.",2023-10-28
"I'm sort of annoyed at the movie, the lore was not like the game or book lore. What happend to the acting family? Why is Chris's name garret and where is Elizabeth also puppet!? I dressed up like her and she wasent even in the movie. Also why was Vanessa now Williams daughter and why wasent William all mangled up when he was shown? Also the animitronics are ment to try and kill Mike? The movie was all over the place aswell what was up with Mike's flash backs? The family is nothing like the Canon one he is the only one with half of his name right and the bite of 83? That never happend well I guess we now have the bite of 2000 but that was just boring.",2023-10-27

"The ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" film successfully translated the key elements of the beloved game into a cinematic experience. The storyline was engaging and managed to capture the essence of the game, which would undoubtedly bring back memories for those who had played it in the past. However, it's worth noting that while the film maintained the game's atmosphere, it didn't quite deliver the same level of fear and suspense that players often experienced while navigating the virtual pizzeria filled with animatronic horrors.One area where the film excelled was in its casting and visual design. The actors' performances were commendable, and they managed to bring life to the characters from the game. The visual aesthetics were also impressive, as they faithfully recreated the eerie and unsettling ambiance of the original source material. The filmmakers clearly put effort into ensuring that the film felt like an authentic extension of the ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" universe.That said, it's undeniable that the film could have pushed the boundaries further when it comes to delivering spine-tingling scares. While it did maintain a level of tension, some viewers might have been left wanting more intense and frightening moments to truly immerse them in the horror.In conclusion, the ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" film is a must-see for fans of the game, as it effectively brings the game's world to the big screen with a compelling story, strong performances, and faithful visual design. While it might not be the scariest horror film out there, it offers an enjoyable cinematic experience for those who have a soft spot for the iconic animatronics and dark lore of the series.",2023-10-29
"I wasn't expecting much after seeing poor reviews. The movie was good for what it was. It did not drag on and had a good story line. They did a decent job of explaining the characters and what not. I wouldn't say this is a must see, however it's worth a watch. From what the trailer showed I thought there would be too much blood and gore for my child to watch it but there was really only once or two scenes that were gory. All in all it was better than I expected and I am glad I watched it. I think the poor reviews were a bit harsh as this was a decent movie. It is definitely worth a watch go ahead and see.",2023-10-28
"You can tell when a studio really respects the source material of a film they are working on. Blumhouse did not disappoint when it came to adapting Five Nights at Freddy's.The atmosphere of this film is perfect; it legit feels like that you are in the first game. The animatronics are amazing! They came off as very menacing but also were eerily adorable in certain scenes.The protagonist was flawed but decent. The antagonist was a bit of a disappointment to me but I am curious to see how they are handled in future movies.Overall, this movie was very enjoyable. I am looking forward to more!",2023-10-29
"I'm a huge fan of fnaf, having been part of the fandom since the first game came out. I honestly can't understand why critics are hating this movie, it's wonderful! Everything i could have hoped for!! There's literally only one scene I would change and that would just be making the springlock scene a bit more gory. I understand why they didn't, and even if it's not as jerky or exaggerated as the game scene, it is still horrifying if you let it be. It's really cool, honestly, and I'm so happy to just see it.God, and the Easter eggs? If you're a FNAF fan you will ADORE this movie, it's perfect. References to the first two games, to the books, even to the newer games. I'm just absolutely living for this. And it's funny too! Seriously perfect.",2023-10-27
"I gave this a full ten stars because I think it needs a higher overall rating. In my opinion it was one of the year, and it deserves a high rating.I loved all the references! As a lover of the games, it made me very happy to see all of the little easter eggs. The storyline was fun... although bits of it weren't quite clear, I guess that's part of the mystery aspect... The movie was not scary though... it is supposed to be a horror film, but it's not much more than a thriller... and barely that... while it can be a little bit gory, it's not much creepier than The Gremlins... but I loved it anyway!",2023-10-28
"Man, did I love watching this movie.I've been a FNAF fan for ages, ever since the first game came out, and the attention to detail is just amazing! From the springlocks to the animatronics nearly everything was spot on.Not to mention that there were no corny jokes as many people were expecting there to be.Whilst there may be some things that aren't totally accurate to the lore of the game, it still felt authentic. (Partly because Scott Cawthon did work on it.)In conclusion, any dedicated Five Nights at Freddy's fan, or even a casual horror player should take some time out of their day to watch this movie. They will definitely enjoy the cameos and credits.",2023-10-28
"I watched the movie on opening day, I would say it is the best movie I have seen all year, the suspense is incredible, with plenty of great heart-pounding moments but kinda dissappointed with the lack of good jumpscares. The storyline was very well done, and faithful to the games. As I said in the headline, the visuals are awesome, they are very well-done, and gives a while new depth to the iconic franchise. The animatronics themselves look great, even the small details, like the TVs, lighting, and other technology really fits the setting.I would say it is the type of movie that you would not listen to the critics.",2023-10-28
"Well it's a good movie but not perfect but very good.My favorite part is when willam Afton said I always come back. And the credits with the living tombstone song wow and cory and I think u should go and watch it its a good movie so that's all for I can't wait for the second movie and il he will come back
He will more times than I can count
And when cory saw balloon boy he screamed
As also I have nothing else to say that's all from me
So I'll be here next movie make sure u all have a good next few years and hope I enjoy the movie as much as I did and I will see you all next time byeeeeeeeee!",2023-10-28
"I will preface this by saying I have been a fan since the first game came out. I am truly astonished and my expectations have been beyond met. While this movie didn't follow the lore 100%, it did add some fun surprises which kept the fans who knew the lore on the edge of their seats.I felt as though Abby's character wasn't necessary, her character wasn't poorly betrayed by any means but I am confused as to why the character was written in the first place. Her character just felt thrown in and really out of place, however the actress was so loveable on screen.As for the scare factor of this movie, I was not scared at all! I have played every game that has released so the initial scare factor had warn off long ago, but this isn't a negative at all. If you are a fan and have been for a while, you probably will not find this scary.The references to the games are amazing, I will not say them to prevent spoilers, but my cinema went WILD and it was such an amazing experience. If you are not a fan, the movie will definitely be a bit confusing to you. It's amazing to see what it did to my community opening night, Im so glad fans across the world can share that same enjoyment!Some are saying that the movie isn't as climatic as we were anticipating, and I do agree. The first game was not climatic compared to the other games where the lines start connecting, and I do believe that was the intention for this first movie as it has been confirmed 3 will be released in total.To sum up this poorly written review, this was the perfect tone to set for the beginning of this movie series. My 12 year old self is beyond happy, the 9 year wait for this movie was well beyond worth it. Even if you aren't a fan, I would suggest seeing this.",2023-10-29
"So, I am a pretty big FNaF fan, I may not know a whole lot, but I think that with enough effort, it can be pretty creepy or scary, especially some of the fan stuff(nonexistent video by Battington, etc). I just saw the movie on opening night, and my friend and I went and saw it with his Dad as well, and his Dad doesn't know much about the franchise except for the basic premise, like the springlock suits, William Afton, you play as a security guard in the OG point and click game, but he still thought the movie was pretty good for a movie based off of a video game, which isn't always the case(OG Super Mario Bros. Movie, for example). I don't personally think it deserves to be titled a horror movie, more of a thriller, like my friend found it pretty scary, like when Max gets pulled into Freddy's mouth and bit in half, or Foxy's first jumpscare. But, I won't subtract it nit being very scary from my overall review, because it was still really well made and is based off of something I like. I would also like to point out that you are most likely to enjoy it more if you understand the references, the actors, the songs and stuff like that. It is also entirely possible that you will get a loud theatre, like mine had a lot of clapping and cheering at various points throughout the movie.",2023-10-28
Rlly good movie if I have to be honest.. I'm just so happy that they actually made a movie abt fnaf so ye Wish the springlock scene was more bloody or how I'm. Gonna say it but still loved the movie (I swear if ppl aren't grateful for the movie after hard works...) I really hope that they are gonna continue with the fnaf movies and if I'm right they are now maybe officially already making fnaf2 movie right now idk if it's true but I think it is. If they're making more movies then it will definitely improve the scary stuff etc. I would definitely watch it again. Recommend watching it atleast 1 time.,2023-10-28
"Part of me was expecting for it to follow the game exactly, but was not surprised that they went their own way. It was a pretty good movie. Can't complain, good plot and story. Hopefully it gets a sequel. Fun for the family. Not gonna have any spoilers. If you like the game and the books, dont go in there expecting it to follow. Go in there was an open mind. Its gonna be like the mcu or dcu they are not gonna follow the comics exactly they are gonna have changes to try and make them more entertaining. Gonna continue to watch the movie on peacock and see if i can find any more easter eggs from the source material.",2023-10-30
So much hate and not enough appreciation for the lore I wish it could be 100% accurate to the games but for what it's worth I would love to see a sequel. If you appreciate the games this film is worth a watch if you want to watch a random scary movie it may not be your cup of tea as it has a lot more lore than horror. I feel too many are displeased that it wasn't loaded with jumpscares or gore when the point of the movie to tell a story of the games with horror elements. In the 1 hour and 40 minutes timeframe I can say it painted an amazing picture and really allows people to go down the FNAF rabbit hole of lore.,2023-10-28
"I really liked it, but I'm heavily biased. You could tell Scott Cawthon had oversight over everything that happened in this film and the story is very faithful to the games, just altered for a new audience. If you've played the games or are very familiar with them, you will most likely enjoy this film, like I did. If you're not familiar with the games, I can understand if you are left confused and possibly disinterested and that's okay, it's not going to be for everyone.I will admit that the acting was hit or miss. Josh Hutcherson and Piper Rubio did a great job as their respective characters throughout the film, though it was a little iffy at the very end. Matthew Lillard was just okay, but I can see how Afton would be a difficult character to act. Elizabeth Lail's performance as Vanessa was honestly not very convincing to me, but to be honest her character isn't even that fleshed out in the games either, so maybe there wasn't much to work off of.The production and set/costume design was really great in my opinion and should be appreciated. They really made the world of Freddy's feel real and dynamic. I also loved the cameo appearances!",2023-10-28
"The look of the movie was amazing, but when it came to the actual story it was inaccurate and poorly written. I feel like the movie could have been much better if it was actually scary and less kid friendly.I do hope they make a 2nd one and listen to these user reviews the movie could come out much better if it actually followed the storyline correctly and was actually scary.The look of the movie was amazing I just think the writing/story is what ruined it. Overall decent movie and I would be glad if they made another, but just tweeked it to actually follow the storyline and make the movie less kid friendly, I don't think they understand most of the targeted audience is grown now.",2023-10-29
"Of course it has such a terrible rating for film critics, you have to have knowledge of most if not all of the games and know minimal about the books. Unfortunately, that's challenging for reviewers who put no heart or soul into reviewing something people actually care about. If you're a fan, you will enjoy it. It's goofy and just about what I would expect from a Hollywood adaptation of the FNAF series.It's not terribly scary, as it's 13+, and I don't even know who expected it to be. You simply can't make robotic fuzzy animals too terrifying. Those genre's don't mix unless you're talking about the games, and even after they lose their charm too.This movie isn't lore accurate either, but it doesn't need to be. I'm just glad that instead of repackaging the same story over and over again, they came up with something new.TLDR: get informed before you review something.",2023-10-28

"It was a good film, I liked the references to games, but I felt something was missing. The film had scenes that I found unnecessary and others that were boring.Spoilers ahead.Why scenes focused on building a fort for the robots?It could have more horror and suspense scenes, like the scene with the animatronics vs the intruders. There was very little focus on Matthew Lillard who was supposed to be The villain.And on a more sentimental side, I missed having an exceptional character in the FNAF games, Michael Afton, I think it would have been more interesting to focus on him as the protagonist. In the scene where Vanessa (If there is a second film I hope to understand more about her being Wiliam's daughter, because...well...it wasn't a good surprise) vs William I left the cinema imagining William vs his eldest son michael afton.All that aside, it was a 6/10 movie for me.PS: I loved the ending playing The Living Tombstone. It's good to hear music created by fans, I hope to hear more references like this.",2023-10-28
"I understand that critics wanted it to be rated R, but you think about it this game came out when we were pre-teen and this generation is learning about this game that brought joy into our lives if Scott never made Fnaf, we would never have this movie. I have been a fan since 2014 and played all the games, to see this movie in the theater, I cried, it brought so many memories and joy into my life. I didn't care if there was no stuffing involved, there was a cheesy jump scare or famous YouTube. They got the lore right! To the kids missing, the design of the restaurant the characters, and most importantly the main killer.Thank you for your time.",2023-10-31
"Holy moly my mind is blown.This movie is an absolute thriller/horror movie. The acting was superb, the story line had to many great twists and turns and for me being a FNAF fan, many of the storyline elements from the games timelines are in this movie and the cross-overs between game and film timelines are perfect.The jump scares were chilling and unexpected (especially a few of them) but not scary. The environments were absolutely incredibly well done.The acting with Josh Hutcherson as Mike was incredible he did a wonderful job. All of the actors did a wonderful job.The animatronics were flipping incredibility done and they had their own personality when they were mean, nice, and ready to kill.The ending was something I wasn't expecting and it will be a movie I want to watch again.",2023-10-29
"This movie was very interesting for me, the story was pretty good, the design was flawless and the acting was really good.The only problem for me was that I just did not understand why the MC did not inform police or anyone else of anything that was happening during this film. Find out the murderer of the children and where they are put, dont call police, find 3 bodies and get slashed by ghost 7 foot animatronics, dont call police. And its like the bodies just dont even exist, the 3 bodies were last seen entering the establishment, no one searches it or questions the security guard working there. The aunt gets killed by freddy in his home and then we just completely forget about her, the police dont question why there is a dead body in his house? How do they explain? * Oh a ghost robot came into my home and killed her! My 5 year old sister who has imaginary friends saw it!. Also the fact that there are security camaras in the building with possible recording functions make it make less sense. And what happened to that first security guard? He died and turned into an animatronic? Did no one check to see what happened to him at his work? SO much more whys. I know its for kids and what not but I just was so annoyed at this. ALSO what happened to this guys parents? It was never mentioned, what they just left there son alone to fend for himself and deal with the tragedies alone?Other than that It was actually pretty good, the music, cinemetography, the acting, tension was decent and overall 7/10 (needs more jumpscares)",2023-10-28
"The movie has a simple premise, for the most part it is created to simplify a story that has been building since the original game was released, which was years ago.Inspired by the first game, ignoring the built story, the Five Nights at Freddy's movie meets the expectation that existed only in the year in which the first game was released, in this, the story was simple and concise, allowing you to enjoy a little else, especially for all audiences.Some performances have problems, but the selectivity that existed when choosing the cast is concise and above all correct. There are great scenes that remind us of the true meaning of this saga, and the actors did a great job when filming these.From a fan's point of view, I hope to see the rest of the movies soon!",2023-10-28
This was the best movie of the year and if it doesn't get 10 stars I'm actually gonna kms. Along with that this movie had so many secrets in it and I don't get why anyone would like to considering that the writers of this movies did so much research so that they could add so much details from the game into the movie. They also made some of the characters have the same words from the game which made it feel like I was reliving a moment from the games. Along with that I love how accurate they got the animatronics and think that they deserve to get the best horror movie of the year and don't get why it wouldn't be 10 stars.,2023-10-29
"When me and my friends saw the opening I thought it was going to be a good movie... Then I saw matpat. I started to edge nobody realized then I started getting excited so I got naked... I got close every jumpscare but I stood strong. Then I saw him. CoryXKenshin. This made me blow like Al qaeda. I shot my load 4 seats infront of me EVERYONE LOOKED AT ME. I panicked and got scared I can't believe people were watching.. I never thought this would happen. Freddy, Chica, Foxy and Bonnie looked at me through the screen in disbelief and disgust. I felt so bad for the kids watching the movie. Why did I even watch this movie. Good movie though.",2023-10-29
"The best movie, its ending and character development is very good, there is almost no filler and little development, the animation is very good and continues with its stories in the games. It has a lot of references that are easy to understand for a person who doesn't know anything about his history in the games. The characters are some very good at acting, if all the characters are good at acting, the ending is beautiful and interesting and gives us a good image of the saga and of the entire story. The animation is very good, it looks very realistic, its story is very realistic but not as realistic as murderous animatronics but its story is realistic, I hope they make more movies.",2023-10-30
"This movie is perfect it started off quite similar to FNAF (the first game) and the silvers and and was a perfect concoction of both and the Vanessa plot twist was perfect, the various reference to small things such as Sparky, Fetch ""Its me"" Cory and Matpat kept me similing the entire time and William Lillard was perfect for William Afton and despite the movie being for younger audiences it still had some gore aspect such as Freddy chomping the lady whole upper body off and the Freddy machine thing at the beginning of the movie the only small thing that was kinda underwhelming (for me at least) was the springlock failure scene as it wasnt as brutal as it was depicted in the books and the games but other then that this movie is perfect and the ending with the animatronic carrying William was such a fantastic callback to the books this movie was perfect and it did not fail to disappoint me.",2023-10-28
"The only reason fans hate this movie is because they were expecting the movie had something to do with the lore or at least similar with, they also expected the animatronics to act original as within the games via very scary jumpscares. The acting was decent, animatronics were slow and cloggy but design is hard work. Hardcore and day 1 fans should not be setting expectations for something being waited for 8 years, rather expect a sequel and a day in the life type movie. There were references which I liked, Coryxkenshin and Springtrap's catchphrase. My expectations were high, but it's just a bread with nutella movie. So to summarize, it has nothing to do with lore, it's all new, the animatronics aren't what you're expecting, no scary jumpscares, it isn't a horror movie, Minimum age rating is 13 via not good comedy. 5-6/10. Writing isn't that bad, action is decent, plot is below average, no featured game originality. And yes there are post credits of coryxkenshin, and a secret message at the very end of the movie so you need to stay till the credits finish as well. The set was good but it isn't really necessary to watch this movie in actual theatres, it will make you leave disappointed since people who book the movie in theatres had high expectations. I hope the next sequels will be better than this, I don't really know what to expect for the next sequels because of the new plot So I'm probably expecting something new and hopefully the producers, direcotrs amd actors improve and learn their mistakes.",2023-10-28
"The amount of attention of detail within this movie is absolutely astounding. The animatronics were amazingly well made and looked so realistic. This movie was packed with everything the fans wanted. Horror, cute moments with the characters we adore so much, long awaited scenes and even music that the entire fanbase was hoping to see. The mix of horror and comedy truly made the movie come to life and feel unique. I loved the Easter eggs poured into the scenes, and the acting was brilliant. I'm so glad I watched this movie and want to watch it a thousand times over. I give this movie my full recommendation for the FNAF fans out there and I hope to see more sequels.",2023-10-28
"I absolutely loved this film. Even though I'm a fan that doesn't mean I'd love this film no matter what. I went into this with hopes of it being good but didn't expect much, this film had me on the edge of my seat in excitement, I felt like the game was brought to life, I loved how they interacted with everyone and still can't get over how amazing they looked !, the easier eggs was fun ! The intro was breathtaking. I'm sad that I can't make a Freddy costume in time for Halloween.I haven't been the the cinema in years and this was the first time I've gone out to watch a film and I'm not disappointed.",2023-10-28
Growing up Fnaf was a big part of my childhood. I've waited 8 years for this movie and was blown away. The fan service was there and i felt like a kid again. Don't listen to the critics they will crap on anything with potential. For the diehard fans that have been here since the beginning this was everything. The casting is amazing and very crucial for the story! The PG-13 Rating will throw people off but gore and blood isn't just all its story. There is layers to the story and i feel the rating was implemented well. It was very interesting seeing how Scott would retell the story and the lore and i hope that we get a series leading more into the lore of Fnaf. Thank you Scott for this gift and for a good 8 years!,2023-10-28
"What's with all the hate? The costume and set desgin are amazing and the story was interesting to follow, Yes i also wish the gore could be added up and more jumpscares but for the rating it was at, I enjoyed it!.The fort building scene actually made me a little emoinal seeing them act like kids again and wanting friends with Amy.The acting from Matthew also was amazing when he said his line 'I always come back"" It was mostly everything little me wanted to see so glad i got to see it and be apart of its golden age as a kid! :) Would recommend if you want a nice time or like the series!! :D.",2023-10-28
"I don't think the movie was that bad but was also not prefect it a fun bad thriller film. It could've been better if they didn't make the animatronics look like they just did a smoking weed session when they are about to kill someone. The if they just replaced the red eyes for dark with white pupls eyes this movie could have been more scary. And the ending and spoiler warning why was the pizzeria collapsing. It doesn't make any sense but I would say this is a film for the fan base it not a film for people that are not familiar with franchise I enjoyed the film and also this movie had a lot of Easter eggs. Is a 7/10 film for me. This gaming franchise is my childhood when I was four years old my cousin show me extraordinary horror game named five nights at freddy's I play it for hours and get killed by the animatronics named freddy bonnie chica and foxy. And after that I was like wow that was scary then I watched matpat markiplier jacksepticeye coryxkenshin dawko 8 bit Ryan and fusion for hours. 6 years later I am still a fnaf fan I still support scott Cawthon. 1 year later Scott decided to retire everyone was upset that year. And 2 years later he decided to go out of retirement and make this movie it's gonna to be the last project that scott will do and who knows after these last 2 movie if they get made then what, well we just wait for something to happen in the future. And thank you Scott for making a lovelbe gaming franchise.",2023-10-30
"I was unsure what to expect as I hadn't played the games but the storyline seemed to be seriously lacking and all over. There was a few gaps in it as well, certain things just didn't add up or make sense.I wouldn't necessarily call it a gory/horror movie either it wasn't particular gruesome or scary in any way. There was a couple of parts where my girlfriend thought she best look away but it didn't show anything anyways.I think they've left it open to bring out another one but if they did then I wouldn't watch it unless there was absolutely nothing else I wanted to do.Overall I was quite dissapointed.",2023-10-31
"As a lifelong fan of the FNAF games, I was SO excited to see this film. The production design, cinematography and MOST of the acting was fantastic. But that screenplay was insulting if you're a diehard fan.Sure it was nice to see everything come to life, and the references led to some great moments, but after the first initial ""horror scene"" it becomes a joke of a film. I wanted to see the dark story of William Afton and the grizzly murders that took place... not a watered down kindergarten rip off. You'd almost expect this to be made by Disney.See it for the sake of seeing it and form your own opinion, but don't expect a coherent story that is true to the lore.",2023-10-29
"The beginning was pretty good, felt like another Scott Cawthon game, references to the game were good, cupcake actions were great, good decision, got cute moments that I could hug (if I wasn't an adult) , I loved how the acting of the actors was, especially Matthew Lillard's was very spectacular, the movie had fanservice and that was very pleasant, the story seems something simple but enjoyable for these Halloween dates 🎃, I saw it with my mom and after watching it I asked him how the movie was (It should be clarified that he is not a fan of FNAF) she told me that it was good, that the style seemed very eighties, like going back to the future, for example, which I didn't understand because everything seemed to be like that, and the only eighties thing I caught was the pizzeria hahaha, I may be from 2003 but that's fine hahaha, I was also able to enjoy how the animatronics act, they have expressive movements and I liked that and it made me laugh a little in one scene, but the expressions were good, my heart didn't stop beating throughout the movie because that 12-year-old boy who waited so long was really happy, and I can say that it was worth the wait, I hope the sequel doesn't take another 8 years hahaha Maybe some were expecting something more terrifying, but most FNAF fans are happy for this movie, including me, I love you Scott Cawthon 🐻🐰🐥🦊",2023-10-28
"It's not that scary, and FNAF isn't supposed to be that scary! The tension is good, the characters are likeable and enjoyable, and the movie is loyal to the franchise.This is a Mystery/Thriller/Horror movie targeted at younger teens, and it's exactly how a movie like that should be! It's engaging, interesting and keeps you wondering.My favorite thing about the movie was probably how dedicated it was to the franchise. I'd say, out of everything in the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise, it's the most loyal to the themes of the story.Children who didn't deserve any of this? Check.Some guy being a jerk and ruining everything for everyone just because he's a horrible person? Check.Mike trying his best? Check.It's genuine. This movie has so much heart, for a horror movie. It loves it's characters, which makes you love it's characters. It lets you enjoy the deaths, and makes you scared for the main characters' safety.Needless to say, I love this movie so much. It's everything it should be, and everything I wanted.I expected to hate this movie, but I came out shaking with joy. I spent several minutes shouting with glee after a certain part.",2023-10-28
"This is very good movie silly Willy har har harhar har movie and Freddy fazbear gets so crazy that he says ""It's fazzing time"" and fazzes all over the place! This absolute amazing movie deserves more love as people are mad it's not a great horror movie it's more for the fans that have loved fnaf from the beginning and the critics are wrong as they usually are. Rotten tomatoes has the worst critics I've ever seen. This movie is just like the Mario and Sonic movie, seemed bad at first bd from the critics but it was actually a good movie. People are putting too much hate to it and I'm definitely not a biased fnaf fan.",2023-10-28
"YASSSS THE MOVIE WAS decent.A LIL disappointed honestly cuz I was expecting a bit of things and it just didn't deliver at ALL. So many references to FNAF 1, 2, 3, AND 4 with FNAF 1 being the main setting and plot line. I didn't like how that literally made for all the different scenes because if we're gonna go for FNAF 1, I feel like we should stick to said game. Not go all around and do many allusions. The greatest example is the sentient cupcake. That was in FNAF 4 whenever it was possible to get ragged on by the thing. Why is it in the FNAF 1 storyline? Plus why is the cupcake doing A LOT more than the actual animatronics? Like that makes no sense.Obviously all love to Blumhouse for the designing of the characters. They NEVER miss each time they collaborate on a project. Such fabulous work and will always appreciate what they do. Well, tbh they should've put Golden's eyes both to be broken so then it wouldn't have been confusing to the patrons except me that it was Golden the first go around until the end.All in all, enjoyed the visuals through and through (again thank you Blumhouse), but hated the story writing. So much of the game packed into one 2 hour movie was not the movie AT ALL.",2023-11-01
"I loved this movie and I think the people who didn't either weren't fans of five nights at freddys, overanalyzed everything or just let ever little bit mess with them, this is a must watch for true fans who understand that these animatronics are children too yes they may kill but in the books william said ""the dead forget"" and speaking of that alot of this movie came from the books like sparky and ella but if you don't get any of this I don't think you would exactly be into it unless you have an open mind but in the end this is an amazing movie and doesn't deserve all the hate it should have a much higher rating than it does.",2023-10-29
"I must say I'm a big fan of the series, I haven't played every single game but I know its lore pretty well. I really liked the easter eggs and details, and I appreciate the love for the fandom.I didn't expect this movie to be a gory horror film, so I wasn't dissappointed by that. I gotta admit I was hoping for an interesting story like the one from the games, and not a violence spectacle. And even though, that was what they gave me, it didn't quite get me.I really enjoyed the first half of the movie. The main character's problems, their traumas and the missing brother. It creates a nice mistery atmosphere that plays really well. Once they start connecting the dreams with the missing kids, it starts to feel a bit forced.It's like the main character's plot doesn't fit nice into the FNAF story. And how they solve the kidnap enigma does not feel organic at all, it's a poor explanation to a really good setup.Talking about poor things, the dialogue wasn't the best. Not only not the best. But it falls short in many scenes, and there is a lot of overexplaining.Overall: could've been way more.",2023-11-01
"I actually really did like this one but if you didn't like it, it's okay cause for some people they won't like it as much as everyone else even though Scott took many years just to get it perfect for his fans. But I get that some people wouldn't like it since it isn't following the lore of the game but following the lore of the book. Like for instance Vanny also known as Vanessa is William Aftons daughter in the movie instead of there being 3 afton kids. And there isn't a bite of 83' so that was what made me sad about the movie but other then that the movie was amazing even balloon boy scared me a couple times even though he was like a statue and at first I thought puppet wasn't in it but I found that she was hiding in random places behind chica so that made it better.",2023-11-01
"I didn't know the movie was
About the books at the first, I initially thought it was about the game But it was very cinematic and the quality, acting, animatronics, and filming was great in my opinion! I also loved how they included content creators who played the game in the movie! It was a nice surprise and the other easter eggs were fun and interesting if you pay attention. I would watch it again and recommend it to anyone who enjoys scary and fun movies. And I also really loved the choice for actors I wouldn't be able to choose anyone better for the roles and the child actors were amazing!",2023-10-31
"After over 4 years of waiting for this movie to release and finally being able to view this franchise on the big screen, I can say that this movie was worth the wait and then some, everything from the matpat cameo to the springlock failure, every small unneeded detail was just perfection, I loved the idea of a wall of drawings dictating what the animatronics thought as a way for William to control them. This movie is just perfection, screw the critics, they do not know what they are talking about with this one, thank you Scott, for everything you have brought to this world, your franchise is my childhood.",2023-10-29
"This is a really great movie, & must watch if you're a diehard fan of the series. I have been a fan of the Five Nights at Freddy's series for years, the movie was really good I can't wait for the second installment. The original planned of the movie was 2014. Unfortunately the movie was pushed back & delayed multiple times throughout the years, & instead of going with the original thought, Warner Bros. A lot of the fans have been excited for the movie to officially release in theaters & streaming platform/s. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD/Blu-Ray if that I'm ever intends to happen in the next few months.",2023-10-29
"Personally, I enjoyed the movie not only because I have been waiting for this movie since I was in elementary school (I'm 21), because it covered everything. People will say the movie wasn't good but I think that there is a different group of people who went to go see the movie.One who loves the games and other one who loves the lore, I am both but mostly on the lore side. The lore is what makes the movie more interesting and emotional. The game makes the movie somewhat scary but it wasn't because Scott mainly focused on lore and I believe that's why people were disappointed.I advise anyone to watch a Youtube video of the lore before watching the movie in order to actually understand and learn about FNAF.",2023-10-31
"Generally, the movie was pretty good for a PG-13 horror movie. There were things that could have been done better but for those who are deep in the lore that is specifically in the books, it's a good watch. It's not really ""scary"" but it did creep me out at certain points. The biggest issue I had was the cupcake. The way it moved took me out of the movie and I was hoping for a little more gore especially with the first 4 murders and at the end when Spring bronnie was impaling Afton I expected a lot more blood and pain from Afton.Hopefully in the next movie, Scott and Blumhouse will give us more for the gore and scare element.",2023-10-29
"Im a die hard fnaf fan and this was so good, watching it again soon. I recomend it!!! People who said it was bad clearly hasnt been a fnaf fan/for long. Even if u have still this has lived up to expectations. Personally people who said it was bad are dulusional. Scott worked very hard and this and did so well, when i was watching this i was so happy because after all these years a movie has been made. Im going to watch it again because it was that good to me. The people who played the characters were so good. They were on point! Mike looked almost exactly how i imagin him and michael was just on point! Same as vanessa! I was so happy when i saw cory and matpat in the movie!!! Thank you for reading and please, watch and enjoy the movie!",2023-10-29
"Honestly I had a great time watching this movie. All the memorable lines, characters, youtuber cameos, and Josh Hutchison. The theatre I was in had a great audience and being there with friends was a great time. I will say it is definitely not a movie for people who don't know any of the lore. I would say it depends on a lot of the lore and doesn't contain a lot of jump scares o relatively scary scene. It leans a lot more into storytelling. Although it is lore heavy I wouldn't say that there isn't anything in there that isn't in the original games or lore. I honestly enjoyed the new elements they added and overall again think it's worth the watch and is generally fun.",2023-10-29
"I'll try not to spoil anything, personally I think this is a solid movie for anyone familiar with the first few FNAF games or the lore, though there was a few moments a little too goofy for me personally. The animatronic designs were spot on, the story was clear for anyone paying attention, and there were a few easter eggs for eagle-eyed viewers. There was at least one change to the lore that bothered me a little, and I honestly think that the PG-13 rating hurt the movie at times, but overall the movie was a really good experience for those who are familiar with the games and lore like I am. Solid 8/10.",2023-10-29
"Okay, so, i really don't understand the amount of criticism in this movie. First of all, the soundtrack and the scenes were spotless! It was amazing and i don't know why people are complaining about the springlock scene. If you've read the books, you'd see that it's extremely similar. ""The i always come back was too early!"" Sure, it might be a little to early but his vocal cords literally got destroyed. William wouldn't be able to talk after that.Secondly, the building of the poillow fort scene. All of you have to remember that the animatronics are possessed by ghost CHILDREN. Sure, it might look a little cringy at first bit if you REALLY think about it then makes sense!Thirdly, i've heard people say that there should have been more gore and voilence in the movie, as well as people saying that the movie should not have been PG 13. As a fan from 2017 myself, you have to remember that children want to watch it too. You were a child when you liked FNAF, so why can't you let other children in this generation enjoy it as much as you did too? ""Theyre going to scream in the theatre and cry!"" Have you seen the amount of children that likes horror these days? If they were scared, they wouldn't even be watching the movie anyway! Scott made sure the animatronics looked disturbing enough to make children feel scared, even adults! I'm sure atleast some of you were too. The theatre i went to had children and they were really enjoying the movie. Can't some of you just let the next generation have fun and welcome them? It's making me embarrassed to be in the fandom, honestly.And too add on, fans are saying that the movie wasn't scary enough. You also have to understand that the animatronics are made for CHILDREN TO PLAY WITH. They can't look SO scary, can't they? The jumpscares by thr animatronics, sure, wasn't so scary. But I'm sure that balloon boy got to most of us! Okay, the animatronics weren't SO scary, but i'm sure that we all agree that they made them look very disturbing!Overall, i think this movie was AMAZING. It was really worth the wait. Unfortunately, Markiplier wasn't able to be in the movie since he is currently fliming ""IRON LUNG"" but i'm very happy that youtubers like Coryxkenshin, Matpat and Dawko were able to be in it. Matpat did really fool us all. The soundtrack gave me a feeling full of nostalgia. It really brought me back. The plot was interesting and i'm happy to see the fans that are actually appreciating the effort put into this movie. Scott rewrote the script twice, if i'm not mistaken, to get the movie right, JUST FOR US. Thank you scott, for everything you've given us. Hopefully, we will get more wonderful works by Steelwool studios!",2023-10-29
"I don't want to spoil it, I will just say that the movie was incredible, an experience, something that I've missed with all of the super hero movies. Much like the Mario Movie earlier this year FNAF was truly a good time, the critics are wrong because they don't understand what the general public wants and we want more movies like this, a fun time, no over the top CGI just a fun time. It was also great that my kid is old enough now that he has played the original FNAF (And the sequels) so we bonded over how great and fun this was. Truly one of the best experiences we have had out at the movies ever. Thank you for making this, while it's not a master piece it's pure fun and that's what movies are about, escaping and having a bit of fun just being lost in the magic of the movie for a few hours.",2023-10-29
The fnaf movie was a true show of Scott's work and dedication to this franchise over the last 9 years it was filled whit everything a hardcore fnaf fan would love and like from the realistic animatronics to cameos this movie has it all the animatronics specificity where brilliant in every aspect to the designs to the way they moved and how they acted as actual children even the main character and side characters have amazing screen time and Mike is such a compelling character and you can see why he does what he does which is why I think that this is a 10 out of 10 and a movie that's made for the fans of the games and community.,2023-10-31
"I'm a long term fan of the game series, and have been since it came out. I personally found the movie extremely enjoyable and so did my friends who are also die hard fans. The movie isn't exactly like the games, nor the lore, but things add up and it allowed us to come up with theories for the movie franchise. The visuals were amazing, the easter eggs were intertwining, and the storyline itself left me impressed and wanting for more. I understand some people might be disappointed that it wasn't exactly like the game lore, but I can understand why. When it comes to filming, things are harder to recreate, when in code and game development, it's practically in your hands to mold. The movie storyline wasn't going to exactly like the game storyline regardless. I loved how there were parts from the game but also the books included in this movie, it felt like i was seeing the franchise from a whole new perspective. I think some people are too hard on this movie, it was amazing to watch, and i'm so glad that i've finally gotten to see it after so many years. I recommend this movie to fans, and also people new to franchise! It's capable of being enjoyed by all people, in my opinion!",2023-10-29
"Five Nights at Freddy's is almost as good as Morbius.My favorite part was when Freddy said, ""It's Freddin' time,"" and Fredded all over the place.Truly a masterpiece of cinema. An experience rivaled only by that of Morbius.Go watch this for yourself, I'm serious. Don't listen to the snobby and gross critics (ew), this is the people's movie.Also, I don't know why there were kids in my theatre, but there were. It was kinda funny when one of them started crying, but I more just felt bad. Still, there were some kids that were more than ecstatic to watch the movie, calling out the animatronics by name. Wild.Good movie though; 10/10 would watch again.",2023-10-29
"For a movie about a game about sitting in an office and closing doors, I think they did the best that could be done with this. It had a lot of callbacks to the games along with the same creepy atmosphere that the games give off and I think they did a great job for the first movie in the franchise. Do they have things they need to work on, yes, obviously, but I think they have a good thing going and could make some more movies with the improvements they think of from this movie. I thought the acting was good and for most of the movie, I didn't really know what was going to happen. I feel like if you go into this movie, you need to go into it with the knowledge about whether you want a movie along these lines or just a movie about a man sitting in an office and getting scared by watching some cameras.",2023-10-29
"I personally waited 5 years as a fnaf fan for this movie. And I will tell you. It was good. But me and my friend were just making some jokes about vanessa, cops, and some other stuff like that. Great movie overall. But me and my friend messing around seeing that movie was amazing. One of the best movies we joked around in. Making jokes about the meme, and people showing up. Only bad part were the basic white girls screaming when a youtuber came up. But all around. Great funs and laughs. Now for the actual movie. I wish it just showed some gore or bleeding. I'm sure scott and blumhouse are planning on making atleast 2 more in another 5 years hopefully. But this one was just fun to mess around in. Personally. It was my friends birthday and we just wanted to flip around. So we decided why not use this as the movie. Nothing bad but like throwing stuff at a screen, and some other stuff. Nothing annoying that nobody could hear. Just some whispering of jokes and that. Sold 8.5/10, the balloon boy jumpscare got me though. And the part where mike and the animatronics made stuff was confusing, but after they got mad and almost killed his sister. Was more better.",2023-10-29
"For starters, this movie is made for the fans which a lot of people should have seen coming with how the Super Mario Bros movie was made. A good portion of the reviews are critiquing the story but as somebody who has followed up on everything that has come from this series played a lot of the games read some of the books, I understood it very well and while it does differentiate some parts of the story from the original I still found the story very intriguing and the movie pretty good. Some of the scenes were a bit odd and I did question the writer's choice but for the most part if you have played the games you'll probably get the gist of it. If they make more of the movies (which I really hope they do) I think eventually the overarching story could make more sense for those who don't have the prior knowledge, but for now I'd say this is a pretty good film but don't go into it looking to be scared. This movie is hardly scary at all. It caught me off guard like twice but other than that this movie was just fun and the acting, cinematography, and soundtrack we're all really good, however I would say if you're just going into this with no prior knowledge of the games or story, you're going to have a hard time understanding it. But to say this is movie is bad I would say is a bit harsh, it has some really good parts and overall it's just solid 7.8/10 movie. Would recommend!",2023-10-29

"I didn't know anything about the game when I first saw the trailer for this movie. I ended up doing a little reading up on it just so I had an idea of what it was about.The movie started out slow, like for the first half of the movie. I get it was building up a backstory, but it took much longer than needed. It wasn't a scary movie by any means - no jump scenes, limited violence, no blood or gore. It was kinda cheesy overall, but in a fun way I guess. The ""plot twist"" was quite predictable, and the ending was rather dull.Would I watch it again? No. Was it worth watching once though? Yes...",2023-10-29
"I really enjoyed watching the animatronic characters on the big screen it feels really good to finally watch this film in cinemas. If you are a fan of the games you will definitely want to see this movie but it kinda doesn't follow the game accurate lore and try's to do its own thing witch kinda works but the story is a bit, meh. The cinematography in some of these scenes are amazing and most of these scenes as a fan will put a smile on your face. The movies props and practical effects are amazing and the animatronics are really cool to see on the big screen. The five nights at Freddy's film is a fun film and worth watching if your a fan, but don't be too impressed if u expected it to be gory.",2023-10-29
"I'm glad I saw this movie, I don't know what other people don't like about it. Scott has been working on this for years and it doesn't matter if new fnaf fans or someone who doesn't know fnaf don't like it, Scott did it for his fans and he succeeded. The movie has several secrets and I'm looking forward to everyone solving them, but most of all I'm looking forward to the next fnaf movies, I'd prefer if they were all released a long time ago and I could just watch them and enjoy them all as much as this one. Thank you Scott for everything and I'm looking forward to your next movies and I hope you don't change them just because of people who expected too many bloody scenes and didn't watch the main thing.",2023-10-29
"It's good. The film promised what I would give. The scenario and the tense investigation atmosphere were good. The only thing missing was a little more of the story behind the film and more scares. For example, there was a lack of: More references, more characters, less cute scenes and more horror. However, the production only gave the basis of what Fnaf is. So we needed to add more information about the origin of this fiction. I congratulate the production team for the effort they put into making the film and thank them for bringing the nostalgic game to the big screen, that's it for FNAF, Thanks.",2023-10-31
Its very unique interesting and i defineatly was entertained through the entire movie. I think it maybe should have dove in to William aftons lore a bit more and thats one of my biggest complaints. I would have wanted it to be darker and more gory but it would of course not be the best move since a lot of 15 to 13 even 12 and 11 year olds are gonna wanna watch this movie. A pretty big amount of there core audience are in this age span. The lore of fnaf is really really dark and wicked and i want the movies to follow that and maybe include some of the famous horrible and dark and sad moments from the lore in the movies. I hope they dive in to backstories of the kids in the main animatronics and also about William aftons children and theyre and his backstory with their own take on its since Mike isnt his child here obviously.,2023-10-29
"Pretty much everything I wanted. Me and everyone else in the theater were screaming and pointing things out the entire time. The effort they put in making the animatronics and the entire restaurant and they way they included YouTubers and people from the community was so great I was so happy the whole time it felt like they cared about what they were making and not just capitalizing on something popular.when matpat showed up it was over for every other movie ever. Also springbonnie. I can see why someone who isn't a fan or isn't familiar with the lore would be kinda confused by the whole end bit with William, but I was waiting for him to show up the entire time and when I happened I flew forward in my seat so fast that the people next to me had to grab me to keep me from falling on the floor. Slay.",2023-10-29
"The movie had like two expectations some parts of the movie didnt scare me since the trailers kinda spoiled it and I knew what was coming story wise this movie is cool and Abby did really give most of my emotions for the movie more than Mike did. 10/10.I could say the movie must have a sequel, And I am looking foward to that too. I love how the animatronics did give me some not creepy vibes and scary vibes here and there throughout the movie, I loved Vennessa's chqrecter and role. Pretty much loved everyone in this video even the Youtubers/ Content creators. I'm too sad Markiplier wasnt part of some of it or maybe he voluntarily didnt wanna act for this movie IDK and IDC I'll find out about that.Movie fits well with the story, Quality Great, Cinematic, Loved it (Clap , Clap, Clap)",2023-10-29
"I'm a very Big Fan of Fnaf and in the begining i Was confused and all because i thought the movie would be based on the games, but it's actually based on the books and there are so many hidden secrets and easter eggs. I think the only Thing that would have worked better would be the springlock scene, i hoped for more blood screaming and pain.I understand the people that hoped for more blood and every Thing, i hoped for that aswell, i secretly hoped the movie would have been fsk18 so it could be more Horror and something like that.I also thought the scene where the animatronics build this castle out of chair and tables with Mike Vanessa and Abby a little bit unfitting :/But all in all i think it turned out pretty good :)
And I can't wait to See the second movie.",2023-10-29
I really enjoyed the movie despite the fact that some people are complaining. For me it was really entartaining and something new. I can't wait until the second movie. People really need to lower their expectations when it was known from the very start that this movie wasn't going to be horror and scary. Plot twist was amazing and surprising. Personally for me this movie was one of my favorites of this year and i don't think that will change any time soon. Hope they will listen to good reviews and start shooting the second part of this masterpiece as soon as possible. I would like to see how this story continues in the film.,2023-10-29
It was great I loved at the end of the movie were all the animatronics destroyed Willam and he got spring locked blumhouse make a 2nd movie and if you are a critic that has never played the game then you will hate me it but if you understand the lore than u would love it and holy cow I did not expect the animatronics to be the good ones.but I mean that is kinda the story that they don't remember anything so the attack u becouse they r ember a face like yours in the game but I would definitely watch again and the lore was on point and who else didn't expect vannasa to be Willams daughter but over all great movei.,2023-10-29
I absolutely loved the movie and everything about it there were people saying they didn't like how the line i always come back was delivered but it's more realistic because his ribs and lungs are being crushed from spring locks also people were upset about the fort scene but they were kids and they were manipulating them before they saw who Afton was because of the drawing I also really enjoyed Cory and maypat being in the movie and the scene where the babysitter got bitten in half was amazing finally I like to talk about the credits it was the best song they could've chose and I'm so happy!!!,2023-10-29
"I won't deny that if you don't appreciate story telling or take a peek at the lore. You won't enjoy this.I personally say this a great movie. Constantly keeping you on your feet why'll being a slow burn. It gives past fans time to recognize Easter eggs throughout the movie, and bits of lore. It provides the perfect amount of tension, while also giving you moments to relax. I love that it explains that the animatronics aren't evil as well. It fits into the story the fact that the animatronics are influenced, scared kids. They think they're doing the right thing, and likely not actively trying to hurt people.",2023-10-29
"To put it simply, if you enjoyed the games, you'll enjoy the movie.FNAF has never been a serious series. The games themselves have always had extraordinarily thin plots on the surface, but little dialouges here and there hint to the bigger picture.This movie is no different, and just like each of the games you'll be asking yourself at the end, ""What exactly just happened?"" or, ""What did that mean?""
And just like the games, that's an answer for the sequel(s) (yes, it's supposed to be a trilogy!), but that won't stop fans from making theories while they wait!The references and cameos further confirm that this movie was made for the fans, so enjoy them, laugh at them, and have a good time. But if you've never touched FNAF, this might not be the movie for you.-Connection terminated-",2023-10-29
"The movie definitely throws away most theories about the five nights story. I think it would be a shame to write it off as I think most fans would love to see a second movie or even a tv series but saying that it didn't go their way so it's bad is unproductive.We got to see the animatronics in different lights. It wasn't so geared towards horror but it was focused on the plot and the characters. As an avid horror fan like probably most of the community, I would say that horror movies usually forfeit the plot and favour surprising the audience.I went with someone who didn't know anything about the fnaf world and frightened easy and they said it was scary so it could be that us fans are a little too used to child murder and killer robots.It was a good movie, I personally thought there should have been more gore. It seemed like whenever it was gory they cut away or insinuated it rather than showing how scary the animatronics are.Despite that I still loved it and a certain appearance made me actually gasp in the cinema...
As a 20 year old this movie catered to my teenage years of watching theories and reading book series.It pulled on those familiar heartstrings that made me shake in excitement.At the end of the day the story was finally told and the way it was shown was the way it was meant to be and Scott and the crew did an amazing job.To think there will be a second movie with most likely darker themes and information from the reaction to this first one is exciting.",2023-10-29
"The wait is finally over for the highly anticipated Five Nights at Freddy's movie. It was everything we imagined it would be - and even better! The story follows security guard Mike Schmidt who takes a night shift at an abandoned Fazbear's Pizza location. From the outset, it is clear that there is something dark and sinister about the place.The atmosphere is incredibly tense, and the jump scares will have you on the edge of your seat. But what really sets this movie apart is the incredible acting. Each character feels like a fully fleshed out person, with their own motivations and fears. The attention to detail is amazing, with the set design, costumes, and special effects all working together to create a truly unsettling experience.The story itself is a complex web of mysteries and twists, with unexpected reveals at every turn. Just when you think you have it figured out, the movie takes a sharp left turn and leaves you hanging. It's a truly brilliant script and the whole movie feels like a non-stop roller coaster ride.From start to finish, the FNAF movie is an absolute masterpiece. It's a must-watch for anyone who is a fan of horror, mystery, or simply loves a good thrill!",2023-10-29
"The reason i put 10 stars because i believe the ones who will truly enjoy this movie are the fans like myself. Let me break it down for you1-horror : the horror was too little, i had higher expectations since it was supposed to be a halloween movie, but when it comes to horror it didn't do much, and most of the jumpscares were memes, not complaining though since as a fan i found it hilarious, though i don't believe people who are new to the franchise would find it funny.2-graphic : the movie was almost not graphic at all, i don't remember seeing any blood except like three times.3-plot : the plot was amazing, not EXACTLY like the games, but it's alright, might be disappointing for fans, but i believe they changed it for the general audience since we all know how confusing and complicated the lore in the games truly is, it did upset me a little seeing a story i believed for years change to a whole new story, but that's only one part of the story. The rest is almost the same4-production : 10/10 production. There was not a single thing wrong with it. The intro gave me chills. And it made up for the negative things about this movie and completely set me in the mood.5-world building : the animatronics, the pizzeria, even outside of those, it was amazing. It just felt RIGHT. And i think that's what's going to attract people into the movie... as long as they see the trailerOverall good movie, they didn't really do ""together we are fnaf"" which is good (thought they were gonna do it midway through a certain scene though) and the more you think about the lore wether the game's lore or the movie's lore the sadder you feel, still good plot. Loved this movie and since i'm a fan, i just know i will watch it over 10 times in just a few months.",2023-10-29
"For starters, the movie was great. In my own eyes at the very least. It had elements from the books and games, and had details saved for the fans that stood in the fandom and series for a long time (Ex: Sparky the Dog myth from the first game). These details were so fun to spot and it's like a finding game with them. It was amazing.Secondly, we get characteristics to characters that didn't have them before. William was just a child killer that was an inventor and we still see this in the movie *but* we get to see Michael talk and interact and react to scenes he's in. We learn he sleeps often, possibly has a form of PTSD or general trauma seeing the fight scene at the start of the movie, and is protective of Abby when it comes to Aunt Jane.We also need to remember that the animatronics are still kids at the end of the day. I understand the scene looks random and out of place but its the movie showing us that the kids are still *kids* at the end of the day. They'll be childish and silly, of course they will. Have you ever seen a playground of kids playing together? They play, they fall, they have fun.The movie was amazing, it was fun, it showed us details about characters we didn't know before and gave us insight.It was a great balance between fun and thriller, it's a great movie and it honestly feels like people who needlessly bash these scenes don't understand the point of them or - as a general thing - set way too high of an expectation for the movie. The plot seemed rough but to be fair, this is the first movie of a few as far as I know and you need the whole puzzle to see the picture.As a long term fan of the series who grew up with it and the community, the movie was amazing and fun to watch because of those details and because of my general love of the series.",2023-10-29
"This movie is awesome it was worth the 8 year wait. Sure it does miss a little bit of the horror we were expecting. But, hey at least we got the movie we've been waiting for all these years. The acting was great and all but the puppeteers were kinda iffy. It's no big deal I'm just glad we got to see our loveable animatronic characters on the big screen. If you aren't a fan of the series you might be confused on what's going on or you might not like this movie very much. I assure most of you will like this movie if you are a fan of these games. Just like I did because I've been a fan of FNAF since late 2014. That's why I rate this movie a 9/10!",2023-10-29
"I was suprised on how good this movie was!The graphics were better than I thought they'd be and the acting was decent. It contained some little moments that fans would catch, and the story was simple however it made it easy enough for others to catch on.The end credit song as well as some cameos in the movie made it enjoyable for fans and those alike. Even if you don't understand the references, you'd enjoy this film.Great movie to watch for fun, and looking forward to seeing it again. I think everyone should give this movie a watch as it's more enjoyable than you would think.Perfect for a Halloween party.",2023-10-29
"As a fnaf lover, i basically knew this movie was based from the books such as fetch, 1:35 am, silver eyes, and some more i think i left out, not only is it so good, but its yet so sad to see scotts final project, im thinking scott will give the fnaf to Steel Wool Games, hope he'll be ok!But waiting atleast 9 years for this is so worth it, made me rewatch it 3 times already, and im glad scott made it PG15 cause it shows how much he wants his fans to watch the movie, some movies make it older for no apparent reason.Really good suggest it to alot of peoplethe man behind the slaughter.....",2023-10-29
"To start, objectively, yes the FNAF movie was not as scary as the games, and it's not an oscar worthy film. But that is the point! If you went in to see this movie and expected an amazing horror film that would scare you shizless... idk what to tell you. The film was absolutely not trying to be revolutionary in the horror film genre. It was clearly made for fans, by people who really cared about the franchise. Didn't the youtuber cameos tell you that enough?And I don't see the issue people have with the focus being more on a storyline, because a big part of the series is about the lore! I appreciated the characters and plot, it all connected in a seamless way. I appreciate that they humanized the animatronics because well... they are possessed by CHILDREN after all!! It reminds you that yes this is scary and it's a sad situation. It helps you understand why they are the way they are.Also the cast was fabulous. The animatronics were amazing. I could care less about the scenes with the aunt.. I understand that to be boring and there was too much screen time on it than I'd like it to be. Objectively, I give the movie a 7.5/10. As a huge fan, I give it a 10/10 and Im excited for future sequels!",2023-10-29
I think the movie is great and I enjoyed it very much it has got to be the best movie I have seen my favorite childhood game turned into a movie. The other reason I think the movie is great is because it had my two favorite YouTubers in it. Coryxkenshins acting was amazing and matpats acting was great as well. And the ending was fantastic Blum House you've redemd yourself and I hope you guys do make more of these. Emma Tammi you did a great job at this i hope you will be in the other movies and scott thank you for giving us the greatest thing ever. The games you made are fantastic thank you :),2023-10-29
It was a great movie considering it was not only based on the games but also the books. I've heard a lot of complaints of them befriending the animatronics. They are still children and still want friends and want to play. The only reason why they tried to kill Abby was bc of William Afton. Most killings prior to that was due to their home being wrecked aka Freddy's pizzeria. Most of the lore that has gone around are just theories so you can't expect it to be exactly what you've been told. Scott has confirmed some things in the film. Although he has also caused us to ask some questions or start making new theories. Overall I thought this movie was great and if anyone is complaining they clearly haven't been in this fandom long enough to watch the film.,2023-10-30
I laughed a lot!! Had a lot of great little nods to the original games and was goofy while also having some horror aspects. It wasn't scary by any means but did it need to be? I mean it's Five Nights At Freddy's the movie I don't think the majority of us went into this thinking it would be scary. It was very clearly made for the fans and I loved that. The performances were great and I felt that they brought a lot to their characters. I enjoyed that they brought Vanessa into the movie because even if you aren't familiar with the older games just knowing what Security breach was and knowing those characters is nice. The plot was easy to follow and compacted years of games/books into an almost 2-hour movie. All and all amazing time and will watch again!,2023-10-29
"Don't really get why people are ripping this movie apart, it wasn't that awful, of course there were corny scenes, some forced lines but overall, I really enjoyed it, for the most part that is. The acting was pretty bad , and the script was awful to match. I believe the cast was pretty, the actors matched the overall vibe and feeling of their characters, Matthew as William Afton was a great choice I think, now, two things in this movie that I personally loved was the design of the sets and animatronics, and the music, the music matched with the scene where Springbonnie emerges from the shadows was so menacing, and the animatronic designs, wow, absolutely on point, of course in the games bonnie is purple, but blue really fits him. The set designs, such as the pizzeria were also great, overall this movie is a solid 7 from me, could've been better but not as bad as everyone is saying, you have to know a good bit about the games though, id see why someone who doesn't know a lot about the games wouldn't like it, another problem are plot holes and random choices, such as Vanessa, in the fnaf lore, she doesn't appear until 2050, and im assuming this takes place in the early 2000's, so I'm not sure where that came from, but yeah, that's all I have to say, was worth the watch.",2023-10-29
"I was scared it would be bad because of the many bad reviews of it, especially bc i waited so long for this movie to come out as a young fnaf fan back then, and it was actually really good. Storylines, characters, plot twists, and i dont get why a lot of people complain about mike's repeating dream with little to no context. In my opinion, it makes the movie better and the fact you dont know whats going on but you get more context the more the dream repeats is the reason i love those types of movies. The suspense and jumpscared were good, and that scene where max was bitten clean off the bone gave the movie more horror than it shouldve had. Only bad things about the movie was how they revealed the animatronics were literal ghost children a bit too early, and how afton said ""i always come back"" too fast which didnt give me goosebumps. Ending was great though and would definitely watch again.",2023-10-29
"I will try to summarize, but I have to say that this movie is really worth watching, but before watching the movie, you must know the story of the game and the books, in general, the movie is perfect Ignore the negative criticisms, this movie really has great potential, it is 100% worth watching, so don't worry about it, The quality of the movie was really stunning and the details of the restaurant were great, the design of the animatronics was great and the atmosphere of the movie was exciting,The exciting scenes were excellent and the atmosphere of excitement and anxiety was completely felt
Overall i recommend this movie so why not to try it.",2023-10-29
"I have been a HUGE fan of FNaF since 2015 and this movie is everything I was hoping for! Sure there are some tonal issues sometimes and some weird plot points, but in the end I think the fans will come out pleased!( CONTAINS LIGHT SPOILERS)
The animatronics are beautiful, there are TONS of Easter eggs, and very cool little lore moments that I think the fans will go crazy over. The cameos where also a really cool thing to see in this movie good on them for giving back to the YouTubers who help FNaF kinda become main stream. The acting was good especially from Abby which was something I was not expecting. I know this is a controversial opinion, but I do think they made it decently scary there were somethings I was just not expecting that freaked me out! Overall I think they really did justice to the community.(CONTAINS DEEP SPOILERS)
On the other hand, I feel that the some of the tones, plot points, and the pacing of the movie was a little off. There were just some parts in the movie were I was just like ""Ok now we get it can we move on!"" which was kinda annoying. Other times it felt like they were making the animatronics too likeable by have like Abby dancing with them and the animatronics being all nice. Which I know is like a thing that they treat children nicely, but it was just kinda weird to see them go from all murdery to all nice and cute; just kinda ruined the tone in my opinion. The last thing is the dream part of the movie. What I just thought in the beginning was a cool little nod to the fans turn into a whole big thing. I feel that they could have introduced the missing children in a more cool and interesting way. Rather than have Micheal be weirdly interested in finding his brother that's been gone for years and having these seemingly unrelated ghost children visit him in his dreams (?).It just really didn't make a lot of sense to me.",2023-10-29
"I had fun with this movie and yes the plot could definitely be a bit confusing to new people but if you're a fan of FNAF you will be thrilled with this movie. The jumps scares were disappointing it wasn't bad but the game is known for its jump scares and the jumps scares felt a bit weak but that doesn't bring the movie down to much. Just to mention the Jim company did AMAZING For the animatronics and the pizza place looked amazing. For the most part I thought the scary element was there enough I feel like it could've been a bit more scary with it's PG-13 rating but that doesn't mean there's not bad scary part for an example when mike gets cut by foxy's hook and foxy look at mike and he has black coming out of his eye and that's also what the crying child looked like witch was cool to see. Another thing that brings this movie down is the goofy scenes I know the goofy scenes made scenes but I felt like they could've done something else goofy not a fort but it was funny seeing Bonnie a thumbs up but still I wish there was some more scare to it. And I think the blood was used great for PG-13 and the kill are ok one of the kills is amazing but I,ll let you find out witch kill that is. Overall great time the movie is a 8/10 it could be pushed down to a 7.5/10 but for now 8/10.",2023-10-29
This movie is great for any general audience! Some parts of the movie could use some improvement but that doesn't take away a star. I've been a fan for years now and I really enjoyed watching this. I sincerely hope that they make another film for the second game to see more lore. It is a little bit more kiddy than other pg13 horror films such as M3GAN. Great for a family or anyone of any age. I love the the cameos and Easter eggs too! Honestly it exceeded ALL my expectations! The Five Nights at Freddy's series was a HUGE part of my childhood and seeing it all play out on the big screen made my old self so happy!,2023-10-29
"I know the critics don't like this movie, but you know why? Because they're not fans and this movie was made for the fans that have been waiting this movie for more than 8 years by now. So whatever the critics say, this movie is awesome and is a good adaptation of the history and is really understandable for the general audience. And even the movie attracts new public that want to be introduced to the FNaF world and games. Even the general audience really enjoy the movie and their characters, even when they initially didn't know the games or books. From a fan's point of view the movie is really enjoyable and is really recommended.",2023-10-29
"This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life. I've been a fan of Five Nights at Freddy's since forever.and watching this movie brings a true fnaf fan tons of joy. I hope this movie gets a sequel or two, scott cawthons work really came far and now its got a movie! I deeply recommend this movie to any fan of Five nights at Freddy's! The springlock scene was just right. And the characters each have a different personality aswell and i love that detail!!! My favorite was Freddy in this film. I've always loved Freddy since FNaF 1 in 2014. My family loved the movie aswell along with some friends.",2023-10-29
Okay so like I was honestly making fun of the movie before with those goofy ass screenshots but I'm not even going to lie it was so enjoyable to me so I don't get any of the hate it's receiving. Like some parts were funny to me so it was a nice thing and also even though others didn't like it I loved the nightmares Mike had and how it would change everytime he went to sleep. Also the scenes balloon boy was in were my favorite parts. ALSO THE LIVING TOMBSTONE I WAS SO SHOCKED ABOUT THAT NGL. Even though many didn't expect the movie to be how it was it was still a good experience and was really interesting to me so all the low reviews don't make sense to me. They worked so hard on this with thr budget but it was still really nice to me cause it was such a good movie.,2023-10-29
"I'm not going to spoil the movie as best I can! Fans and non fans alike are giving this movie a hard rep saying they know the story and it doesn't match up as if the creator of the games is not involved with the movie at all. He's gonna know what story he chooses to portray better than any of us. We got the little details we all deserved and who knows we are possible getting more fnaf movies that'll tell more of the story he wants to show! Theorizing about the story is part of the fun! The characters were amazing, and everything I dreamed of! I understand that they possibly kept ""gore"" down to appeal to the younger fans of fnaf to be able to see the movie, and for PG-13 we still got what we wanted! Obviously this isn't an exact copy of alll the ""lore"" everyone's theorized about but it's still an amazing story portrayed amazingly!",2023-10-29
"Ok so I'm 9 and I'm writing this, hmm..
I love the movie but I would not give it ten stars because Venessa doesn't put on her bunny suit and u don't see much of William so...and if you are looking for a movie based off the game you are out of luck but it is good nonetheless.i also don't like how the kids keep coming
In mikes dreams plus the kids are influenced to kill because of William Afton and that is just stupid. Chica is a bad actor and she tries to put Addie an a spring lock well Bonny and Freddy are still playing like nothing happened which is kind of funny but still kind of stupid.all and all I loved this movie and I highly recommend it.",2023-10-29
"I'm coming at this from a fresh out of the movie veiw. It wasn't what I was expecting but it was a great movie. The animatronics were very well built and the movie was very well put together. Im very glad that the movie is finally out. Like most people say it's hard to take a game like fnaf and turn it into a movie but I think they did a wonderful job with taking the kids, William Afton, security guard, and all the other stuff and turning into the movie. I did wish they included the bite and all the big deaths into the movie, but not that bad. I appreciated the comical bits. I would definitely watch it again and I really hope they come out with a second movie. It definitely seems like they will come out with a sequel concisering the ending.",2023-10-29
"I watched FNAF with my son, and he his a huge fan of the franchise. I on the other hand have never played any of the games, or read the books. So this review is based on both of our very different expectations and knowledge of the FNAF universe.My son loved the film, so much so I had to repeatedly ask him to stop narrating. But that is a testament to how good they have created the movie from a fans perspective. Loads of Easter eggs and nods to other games and books. He is also keeping everything crossed that they will make a sequel, which from a fan must be a good sign.From my own perspective I also enjoyed the film, I'm not sure why it's been getting negative reviews. It is what it is, a film based on a computer game. From my limited knowledge and basing on what I've seen from my son playing the game, they have managed to replicate that perfectly. It's not gory, however there are a couple of moments that came close, but didn't cross that line. It's also not that scary either. But then from interviews I had seen prior to watching the film, they set out to make it that way so a younger audience could watch it. If I had to make a similar comparison to the ""scare"" level, think slightly more than goosebumps, but nowhere near IT.So I'm giving the film 8/10. It's not amazing, but it is worth the watch and certainly isn't bad, and it does what it set out to do very well.",2023-10-29
"I am a fnaf fan since the first game was released , playing the games watching the lore etc and i am so happy to see that a fnaf movie was finally released .But keep in mind that this movie is for the community , Scott didn't want to make to expand the community he only wanted to make the movie for us , the og fans
Yes it wasn't really lore related But that dosen't mean it was a bad movie , quite the opposite the fact that it had a diffrent story it makes it more intresting since I think every fnaf fan knows at least a bit of the lore..
In that case if it was 100% based on the lore we would already know What will happen so it would not be that intresting...
Can't wait for the Fnaf 2 Movie , it will probably be even better since there will be WAY more animatronics , But we Well see..
Congrats Scott for the great movie !",2023-10-29
"The Five Nights at Freddy's film is a beautiful movie based on the game series of the same name.The graphics in the film are perfect and well done. One thing to notice is, that the film is not the typical horror movie style and there are not as many ""scary"" scenes, as one would like to see.The only big problem for the majority of viewers who rate the movie as bad/mediocre is, that for the whole understanding of the story and relations between characters, you kind of need to know the whole story of the game series. Many things are more understandable if you researched and got to know the entire lore of the games.All in all, this movie is very well executed in terms of bringing Five Nights at Freddy's to the cinema.",2023-10-30
"This is an amazing film, though from knowing the lore since 8 years ago it did miss with the storyline a bit. But the acting and scenes were awesome. I don't know why people are complaining that it wasn't ""horror"" enough or that the animatronics are terrifying... they're children trapped in a machine. It's a PG-13 movie what to people expect as well as the games. The movie was amazing and I will be watching it over again.I would also bring my family to watch this, i really liked it hence being in the fandom since late 2014. I did also like that many youtubers were shown in the film even if it was little time. I thought it was really cool. Overall i would recommend this movie.",2023-10-29
"The film itself is not something outstanding, but it was not terrible either. I know that everyone is entitled to his opinion, but the film was really interesting and at times slightly scary. Blumhouse along with the help of Scott did a good job and at times I do not understand where such criticism comes from. I personally liked the film very much and recommend watching it.I would rate the acting at such a strong 6-7/ 10
general appearance and decoration 9/10
Costumes 10/10
plot 7-8/10
jumpscare 6/10
music 8/10
That is, the overall score is about 7.8/10, but I rounded up to 8/10.But that's just my opinion, I just wanted to share my impressions.",2023-10-29
"For everyone that rated this movie below an 8 you guys don't understand what this movie is about. THE FACT THAT THIS MOVIE CAME FROM A GAME IS AMAZING. It Exceeded all of my expectations. Amazing actors, scripts, and story telling. Definetly re-lived my childhood. 10/10 PHENOMENAL!!!!! GOOD JOB SCOTT CANT WAIT FOR MORE TO COME!!!. Critic's destroyed this movie and that's not right. Even though this movie was PG it was still scary and definelty had some unexpected scary scenes haha. Filled me with joy to watch this movie. To have something come from a childhood game we all played. I will be sad when it's all said and done. But made my year 😁😁",2023-10-29
"I wish they could've made it more accurate to the lore and from the games, and even when you watch the movie you can notice it's a completely off timeline from the actual thing. There's also a lot of easter eggs and secret meanings so keep your eyes open. I wish there was more gore in some scenes like how it really was. Being a fnaf fan for a rlly long time, it was kind of disappointing, but it was very cool to watch and yell out references in my head. Especially when you hear foxy ''fum fum fum-'' <3but no it was good, points off for accuracy to the actual games/timeline though.Harharharhar.",2023-10-29
"The movie was amazing,and I like how the movie has easter eggs to popular fnaf things like sparky the dog is in the control room. And a fnaf book character also in the same room,i loved the springlock scene and the ballon boy jumpscare scared the crap out of me,and i liked how fnaf youtubers cameo'd in the movie but markaplier didnt.i loved the fnaf franchise since i was 4 and this movie brought my fnaf phase back. I dont know why poeple hate this masterpiece of videogame movies.i highly recommned wacthing this thiller movie if u want your fnaf phase back or you came back for the loreeeeeeeeee.",2023-10-29
"I see everyone complaining and calling this movie bad, but I really beg to differ. I have loved FNAF since 2014 when the first game was released. When I saw this movie, I was so happy to finally see it put together after 8 long years. Was it worth the wait? Hell yeah it was. It may be more correlated to the books, but the books are good too. Every movie has its flaws, so I won't bash it. I found this as closure, to finally know one of my all time favorite franchises has made it to the big screen. And I have to say, everyone that made this movie possible did a fantastic job, I genuinely want to see more, and I know we will. If I wrote a FNAF movie, I'd do it exactly like this. Don't get me wrong, I wish we got more of the Afton story explained, but I'm sure we will get that in the next movie. Great job guys, and thank you Blumhouse and thank you Scott!",2023-10-29
Though most critics and fans alike are in a heated battle between if its bad or amazing though the film did have some problems with the plot which I agree the plot is mostly paper thin but you have to understand the creator of the game/film said it was for the fans the movie did have some problems that needed to be addressed it's still a great story just wish there could've been more scenes in the pizzeria than dream sequences and the twist being that Willam afton was the bad guy the whole time was not a shocker like the movie it was trying to be and Matthew Willard defeated needed more screen time.,2023-10-29
"Its was literally so good and you also have to think, its a 2 hour movie about a game/book that has over 8 different things, and if you think ""well its not like the game beca-""
majority of it was based off of the book, and its okay to think its bad we all have opinions but me personally and my other family members literally thought it was good, yeah it couldve been more scarier but you have to also think that it's literally pg-13 so its not gonna be all gore-ish or anything, and my little brother really loved it and thought it was really cool, even my parents liked it.I think if youre looking forward to watch it you should!🙃",2023-10-29
"Wish yhere was more gore obviously but its was really good actually, love how balloon boy was the main jump scarer. It actually gave quite a bit of information and a lot of secret stuff if u pay really close attention. Foxy and Bonnie were my personal favorites they were funny and cute but like scary too. The cupcake doing work for chika was hilarious to me. We dont see alot of movement from the cupcake in the games so this was fun to see how the cupcake acts. He acted kind alike a piranha so chompy and stuff. The movie had alot of bad reviews just because if the pillow fort scene and the spring lock scene being disappointing but it was really good besides those. Just needed more death and blood in my opinion 😅",2023-10-29
"This movie was WONDERFUL! Some people may dislike it due to the storyline being a bit different, but in my opinion I would say that it was worth watching. Five nights at Freddys was something I enjoyed when I was little, and seeing this made as movie was a very wonderful and exciting moment for me. Me and my sister and my sister's friend also enjoyed it as will and we can't wait for the next movie, and if there is a second movie then I would most definitely watch it and I hope Markiplier is in it this time 😄. If you are going to watch this then beware that the storyline is a bet different but very worth watching. Thank you Scott Cawthon for creating Five Nights at Freddy.Thank you Scott Cawthon.",2023-10-30
"This movie was all around amazing! The lore of the games didn't follow the movie exactly (and it never promised to) but I believe that's what makes it so interesting. There were new and exciting characters along with characters we have already heard about. Additionally, characters played their parts well, animatronics were creepy enough to make me feel as if they were actually possessed, and the set was absolutely stunning! I played all the games from a very young age and I couldn't ask for more. This movie has made me incredibly happy and definitely something I will be rewatching soon. Plus they even went the extra mile to include audio cues from the actual game. Just keep an open mind and you'll have a great time!",2023-10-30
"This was a great movie that had great visuals and crazy story if you have played the game.(spoiler) Vanessa being the son of William is a very good detail which explains a lot and hints at the games, if Vanessa is Elizabeth or at least an equivalent. I thought Mike was going to be the son by the way William reacted, but it turned out that it was because he killed his brother. The spring lock suit was a very good detail, which was the same with the games. Golden Freddy keeping William alive at the end to torture him was a Cliff hanger that is the same as the games, that you would only understand if you played them. Also, Matpat and Cory's Cameos were very funny and cool. People need to understand the games if they watch this. Or, actually look at the details, my brother was not looking at the details and didn't understand why they introduced the aunt (he's 15). I had to tell him that Abby would never had gone to the pizzeria if they didn't. In order for people to ENJOY the move, you have to play Scott's game if looking at everything and noticing it as a key detail.",2023-10-30
It was more of a thriller than horror but it was still rlly good. It's def more for the fans but anyone could watch it. I rlly liked it and a lot of scenes had my jaw on the floor. I recommend going to watch it with friends for a better experience especially if they know the lore. I had a really good experience watching it in Theaters and I'm rlly glad there was no unnecessary love story involved. After watching it a lot more things started to make sense lore wise but Idk if the movie lore counts as game lore as well but still a lot more things made sense. It was a rlly fun watch and it basically was what I was hoping for.,2023-10-30
"Just finished watching the film and all I can say is its absolutely great. If you're a fan who's had the time to learn the lore and understand everything's that happened you'll love it aswell. I've seen alot of hate down to the ""corny"" moments in the film such as when the animatronics build a fort out of chairs and the scenes where they are all laid down together, I think this scene is perfect as I think people forget the animatronics are children and will behave like children because they haven't had a chance to mature like kids do. Another part I love about this film is the subtle references to the games like ""it's me"" being on a dusty mirror and the sparky the dog reference. The film also slightly follows the games with the spring lock incident happening between fnaf 1 and fnaf 2 which I think is brilliant leading up to a second film also in the end credits hearing the puppets song playing. All I can say if you're a fan of the games and the lore you will absolutely love this film.",2023-10-30
"This movie exceeded my expectations! I can't imagine it being done any other way. The cast was absolutely perfect and better than I could have put together in my dreams. TBH if you didn't like this movie it probably wasn't made for your demographic. Side note, I loved the fort scene. They are literally animatronic possessed by CHILDREN, bffr. I plan on watching this over and over cause it brings me genuine bliss. My eyes were glued to the screen the whole time. I even managed to catch my Boyfriend up on the lore enough for him to genuinely enjoy it himself. The only thing that could have made this movie better was Markiplier.",2023-10-30
"I have been waiting for the movie since 2015. While it is not heavily on the games, I think they did their best to cater the OG fans and those who are new to the community, as well as those who don't know the story/lore. The storyline for the movie still included information from the games and as well as the books. The actors as well did so well playing the part of their role. It truly was amazing to see and am so happy after many years we finally got a FNAF movie! Thank you Scott and the production team for the movie! Me and my friend dressed up for the movie and it was the best experience!! 10/27!",2023-10-30
"A good simplification of a longstanding horror game series. Decent acting and amazing special effects. Though the PG-13 kind of held it back a little. I know it's technically kids horror now so they could only imply so much but I feel like the story and movie could've benefitted from a higher age rating. Still pretty good though. It gives me hope for a possible sequel in the future/more fan loyal adaptations of games in the future.Spoilers: The YouTube cameos while not surprising, were actually really funny with the ones I knew. Hearing MattPatt's voice in an honest to God movie theater threw me through a loop.",2023-10-27
"I felt the movie was pretty well done, and I genuinely liked how they managed the pacing and storytelling. Although there were a few moments that left me feeling a bit confused or disconnected from the overall plot, I can honestly say I enjoyed the movie from start to finish. The plot twist was a pleasant surprise, and I really appreciated the story as a whole. I won't spoil anything, but I just preferred the movie the way it was. It's a bit perplexing to me that some people consider it one of the worst movies ever; personally, I thought it was awesome. It had some intriguing plot twists, added depth to the story, and even included some cool small cameos.",2023-10-30
"Long time fan here.I have to be honest, I cried genuine tears of pure joy when viewing the first time. I have watched it several times since opening day and with every single rewatch I find more and more easter eggs without fail. The film contains just the right amount of fan service to twist ratio to keep even the eldest of fans on their toes. This movie was made with so much love. It truly was Scott's love letter to us fans. I have immense hopes for (at bare minimum) a sequel. In a perfect world we would get two or three more movies. I will be absolutely crushed if we do not get more films.",2023-10-30
"I don't understand why it is getting so much hate. I first got into FNAF by Matpat, and i immediately loved it. After that i waited for the movie to come out and when one of my classmates put peacock on his computer and signed in to his parents account, which had peacock premium, i ran over to his table and grabbed a seat. We only got to the part where the people break in, but just from that i could tell that this is an amazing movie that does not deserve the hate. I plan to see it in theaters soon, so an update may come. It's just so sad how the movie of the year is getting ruined by people who have not played the and don't know the lore. This movie deserves better#stoptheFNAFhaters.",2023-10-30
"The actual story of the fnaf universe is broken and confusing at best. This does a great job hitting the key points and making it entertaining for both fans and people new to the franchise. Lots of fun easter eggs and moments for fans to be excited about. This movie won't be scary to most adults. But fnaf has never been scary to adults. Fans stuck with the franchise for the intriguing story and it's dark themes. Also, the design of the animatronics was very well done in my opinion. It was nice seeing these classic characters on the big screen. I'm used to video game movie adaptations completely disrespecting the source material. I can say this one did a great job. Even the sound design matched the games and I respect that.",2023-10-29
"So I might be biased but it was pretty good, a lot of people say that the animatronics were more friendly than in game but I don't belive so. In the game we play as Mike ( as we know so far) and he is an adult and as you see in the movie they don't really like adults plus like in the game they started ""easy"" on him plus they killed multiple people who broke in. I do believe that the movie should've been more scary and more Jump-scares since that's the games main scare. But that is nothing compared to the amazingness of this movie!! They did an amazing job and the guest appearance made me jump from my seat. They kept the main plot of the game with little adjustments yes I wish it was more scarier but that is all. I loved it and I would definitely see it again. I waited 10 years for this movie and it was definitely worth it. Thank you so much.",2023-10-30
If anyone doesnt like it I have no idea how you cant like it its so goofy and funny and I genuinely enjoyed and got jump scared a few times. I watched it with my friends and I couldnt stop laughing the entire time and if I were a kid I would defenitley find this movie scary but also really enjoyable. People who dont like it saying its not scary and therefore bad are kind of scaring other people away from watching it but please dont let it stop you from watching it I think even if you dont like it you'll get a laugh out of it its really enjoyable. Please give it a chance and watch game theory after.,2023-10-30
"The movie itself is very good, it has very good themes, it gives references from books and video games, almost everyone was idealizing that the movie was the same as in the vhs tapes. They say that the movie is childish and that the animatronics do not kill anyone like crazy, what they have to remember is that inside the robots THERE ARE CHILDREN and apart from that they had to spend time with Abby playing so that she could trust them, the animatronics only killed the security guard because they thought it was William for revenge. It was worth waiting 8 years, I hope this movie gets the fame it deserves.",2023-10-30
"The movie is an absolute masterpiece that effectively brings the beloved video game series to life on the big screen. The animatronic characters are incredibly realistic and terrifying, and the cast delivers outstanding performances. The storyline is full of suspense, and the jump scares are executed perfectly, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats throughout the entire film. Whether you are a die-hard fan of the FNAF universe or someone new to it, this movie is a must-see that blends horror and entertainment seamlessly. It's a cinematic gem that will undoubtedly become a classic in the horror genre. Don't miss this fantastic movie!",2023-10-30
I've been anticipating this movie since I heard rumors a few years back. Extremely delighted and I really hope they continue the franchise. The only complaint I have ( and it's minor) is I wish it was a bit more Gory. But like I said. Minor. The practical effects proved that they will always be better than cgi. Good to see the Jim Henson company doing what they do best. And ca we talk about the fact that they way they were puppeteered and designed to be used the same way they are actually used in the game? As both a suit and an automated robot. Like way to go above and beyond.I will say though that the cameos were awesome. I audibly giggles when I saw matpat :) now I need to rewatch all of the game theory videos and play the games again. Thanks blumhouse !!!,2023-10-30
"The animatronics that are children should not act like beasts, although it was confirmed that it does not follow the lore of the games, it is quite similar to it, it is a film that you will enjoy a lot if you are part of of the Five Nigths at Freddy's fandom for before. I understand that critics may not like it if they see it as a horror movie because the truth is that it did lack quite a few ""bloody"" scenes or whatever you expect, but if we see it as what it is, a FNAF movie, it is wonderful as it is. Regarding image and costumes for fans of the franchise it is like a hug, they are exactly what was expected, the human characters are also quite similar to those that appear in videos made by fans or characters of the same video games as Vanessa is quite similar to Vanessa from Security Breach Ruin. My conclusion is that it is not a horror film, I prefer to see it as a comedy or a horror for children, and quite nice if you also followed the works of Scott Cawthon.",2023-10-30
"Well, it wasnt like what i was expecting. I liked it kinda? But honestly making a third storyline (books, games and now movies) its a bit, upsetting? There is TOO MUCH plot, like they tried to squeeze in 10 games in 1 movie. And the main FNAF thing is surviving 5 night's at a pizzeria with Deadly robots and he sleeps at duty. Not a bad movie, but i wouldnt call it a original good FNAF movie. Soundtracks are really good, plot is complicated and characters are... I REALLY dont know what to think of the movie other than saying its a valid movie that has almost NO similaritys with the original FNAF games.",2023-10-30
"The details and Easter Eggs in the movie are quite the best in all of the movies i watched that have a theme you can rarely see a VIDEO GAME get so much attention including to detail including that it featured
MatPat from The Game Theorist (Researcher in FNAF Lore) Ness in Movie
Dawko (poster) (VIP List from FNAF 3 Release) Included as Photo
And other YouTubers like the Taxi guy being another Fnaf YouTuber
Also The CREDITS SONG after ""The Living Tombstone - Fnaf 1 Song"" is another song by the CREW Containing Puppet/Marionete Music Box Song in the Background as a base for the entire song
The best movie i had ever watched to be honest I was quite happy to see the community get and create something this magistic in just 1 Year Production Began February 1st 2023 according to MatPat.As a FNAF FAN for over 9 years I am quite shocked that the OFFICE is FNAF 3 themed also there is a BallPit and the things saw in that movie fit so well with the ""Goofy"" Story that SCOTT CAWTHON Created over the years. I hope we will see a Trailer / Teaser for 8th August 2024 because
8th August 2014 FNAF 1 Launched Officially.Hope to see something big from the Community cuz this is a BIG year
FNAF 3 Year is 2023 aka 30 years from when Springtrap/William Afton was left standing so also that means that the movie is happening in 1993 Which is Amazing to see.",2023-10-30
"Really good, especially for fans! Everything from The thrill, the atmosphere, to the sound design is on point. It has an interesting storyline and plot, the characters acted well. The pizzaeria set and the animatronics look too good, I would say they look 100% just like they do in the games. Blumhouse has done such an amazing job bringing this franchise to life!. I really liked that they also included some notable cameos too. The amount of love and effort that was put into this flim cannot be understated. Though there were some alterations to the lore, i still think it's pretty easy to follow for the fans, it's way more easier to understand!.",2023-10-30
"I will say ahead of time as a fair warning:
this is my first movie i have seen alone in the theaters as well as my first horror movie in theaters.I think the movie excels at:
not crossing the pg:13 barrier while still having aspects of scary
including people from the community of the game like the youtubers matpat (game theory) and (coryxkenshin)
using the lore for the story of the film while still having unique details/story.What i think it struggles with:
outright being scary
way too predictable plot twists anyone can see 20 minutes into the movie
poor buildup to jumpscares/scary parts of the movie (my opinion)
bare with me as i have no experience writing something like this.",2023-10-27
"Not everyone will agree with me, but by waiting 8 years for this movie, playing all the games & reading up on every detail and coming up with my own theories, I think the movie was a success, I thank Scott very much for making this movie possible for us.Unfortunately it has less to do with the story and there are 1-2 confusing scenes/stories, but Scott knows what he has done.But I think that the film reflects this frenchies very well and as I said, extremely well implemented.Even though I think this is now the official end of Five Nights at Freddy's, as we all know, hope dies last.Jumpscares: 9/10
Story: 8/10
Atmosphere: 10/10
Realization: 10/10
Actors: 9/10
Overall, I'm very proud of Scott and the team and would still give the film a 10/10.I can really recommend it but only if you have some idea about the game/lore.When ""newbies"" watch this movie, I could imagine that they will find the movie weak and confusing, which is not bad, but if you want to watch it and have no idea, deal with it so you can understand the movie better.Thank You, Scott for this Unforgettable Journey, we will miss you and Everything you created.",2023-10-30
"People who watch this movie should turn of their brains and enjoy. I know some lore about Fnaf as I did play the games and watched a lot of gameplay. The movie had a lot of faults but it is fun to watch and it does attempt to convey a theme or message. Movies like Cocaine Bear, and other mindless killing movies are meant to be around for a good time. It did its job well. Some stuff is a little inaccurate to the lore and core of the games but if you don't really care then this should be fun. A lot of unique approaches to the famous characters and their background. Just turn off your brain and enjoy the show. If you try to find a logical action in this film than you will be disappointed. All your classic characters in a new light. Have fun and enjoy.",2023-10-30
"I've been waiting for this film for so long. I'm a hardcore fnaf fan. This movie was great,it was nice to see the animatronics in a live action. It didn't get 10 stars because it could of have more horror to it. The animatronics should appear more on screen because they're the center of attention. Overall the easter eggs were cool and the matpat cameo was unexpected. It was a pleasant surprise. I only wish to see markiplier on the big screen in a five nights at freddy's movie. He is the king of fnaf,as everyone says.In the next film they can have the bite of '87 and '83,jumpscares(from the animatronics,not ballon boy),more horror and a security guard that tries to keep the robots away from him.",2023-10-30
"My favorite part was when matpat and markiplier gave a handy j to springtrap underneath a mcdonalds playpen. Very moving scene to me. I cannot understand how others leave bad reviews. This movie was beautiful and all that dont agree should die a most painful and horrific death. The funniest part of fnaf was when the ice cream hair boys with their girlfriends walked into it thinking it was taylor swift. Very funny, me and the neck beard beside me had a laugh at the debouchary. Im at school writing this. I want to eat a breakfast biscuit so bad but it would be embarassing cause im already big asf.",2023-10-30
"The movie was so much better than expected. The beginning amazing, the end amazing, the middle was alright. Worst part was In the middle of the movie when everyone was making a pillow fort together and having a good time which is not something that would actually happen. Another bad thing was that the spring lock scene was kinda disappointing. They made it seem way more gory in the games and I think they should have in the movie. Other than both of these I thought it was very well put together and overall and amazing movie. I've always loved fnaf and waited 5 years for this and was very satisfied.",2023-10-30
"This movie was amazing! I loved almost everything about it, the eastereggs the acting the animatronic models the visuals and the effects it was so cool to see! And of course Cory and matpat showing up was a huge surprise and it made it so much better! If you haven't watched this yet you HAVE to. Whether you're a fnaf fan or not you'll love this movie! I loved the springlock scene and how they dragged William Afton like in the novels! And of course the famous ""I always come back"" everything was so well put together! I would love there to be a five nights at Freddy's 2! This movie will BLOW UP!!",2023-10-30
"II am not a big fan of FNAF at first, i don't really know the whole lore but i went to see that movie and i was surprisly schocked by this, it was so so good, not very gore just like the games, the storytelling was touching and to play down, they add some goofy moments that i think were needed.All those actors fit very well their characters, the realization of the animatronics like chica or bonnie were very impresive, and the cinematrography was so sickTo me you don't need to know well the lore before watching it, but it'll give you motivation to interest yourself inside FNAF lore, but don't watch it if you just want to see some violent movie without a real story behind.",2023-10-30
"This movie might not be totally accurate and might not have all these good effects, but that doesn't make a good movie, it's the amount of effort and emotion put into the movie and I can tell Scott put his heart and soul into making a movie for his fans and ppl needa realize that and appreciate it. I'm sure no one else in the world could pull this off but him and I'm thankful he was the person writing the script, this movie made it in my top 10 fs and I'll never forget this movie for the rest of my life. Fnaf has been one of my favorite things and I even played it when the first one came out. There's no person I can thank but Scott for bringing this wonderful movie to screen. You did well Scott, you can rest up now. Thank you.",2023-10-30
I first heard about this movie all the way back in 2015 and I've seen a lot of people are angry that the eyes where red and it changed a bit from the games but I say they stayed very loyal to the games ofc things where changed but it was for a movie not a game which makes things more difficult and for what they made was very good the only thing I would want is for it to be a 18 so there could be more creative with the kills. Other things with it as well is they made Mike more of a character he is just a guy we play as who just took a unllucky job at a weird pizza place and in the movie they said why he even took the job and why he was staying and not getting the hell out of there.,2023-10-30
"This film is very interesting and a bit of frightening. The story inspired in the game ""Five nights at Freddy's"" wich is a bit more scary than the film.The film looks great but it don't have the same amount of scary things as the game. It have lots o references to the games wich make the film more than fascinating to the game community and fans.The scenario was incredible and the characters have been well interpreted.I wish that have several sequelae and somehow make the story a little more like the games.The movie needs to be more like a scary movie and not a thriller.It will make the movie more like the game.",2023-10-30
"The Movie was pretty amazing , the opening and the ending was very nice specially the william afton scenes
But the middle of the movie that mike was looking for a job and the scenes that mike and abby were messing with aunt jane, it could have been better.Overall it was a awesome movie and all of the character in the movie were in the right place,
And a pretty good evidence for the fans of the game that the movie pushed them into the right ways of theories , very good references to the books and games like matthew lillard saying ""i always come back"" and foxy messing with ( actually it was a reference to the silver eyes trilogy that foxy chasing charlie between the arcades in freddy's).In the my rating is 10/10.",2023-10-30
"I've been waiting for this movie to release for about 8 years now, but it did not disappoint, everything about it was amazing down, to the animatronics, which looked like they were ripped straight out of the games. I enjoyed the premise of the movie, including its ambiance, the soundtracks were really well-made. Matthew Lillard's performance as William Afton blew me away, it was great to see him as Springbonnie, his animatronic looked the best out of the other four. I'm excited at the news of a sequel (Or should I say prequel). Also, don't listen to the critics of this movie, they just don't want you to have a good time.",2023-10-30
"They were not wrong when they said this movie was made for the fans. As a fan, I really enjoyed it and would recommend it. However, for the average movie goer, I can see why people may get confused by the story and it may not click well with people who don't know much about the games. It's not very scary but has a few parts that may make you jump and feel tense. It has a few cheesy scenes as well but is still a fun watch. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience and longtime fans will not be disappointed. Also, Matthew Lillard was one of the best parts of the movie and there couldn't have been a better pick for his role.",2023-10-30
"The anticipation for this movie was massive and it did not deliver. It was so predictable and don't get me started on the cringe level. Like, why are we threatening to shoot people for doing their job? It was so obvious who was the ""mastermind"" behind this whole yawn infested shenanigan. Also, how did Mike not see Abby's drawings before all of this, they were hung around the kitchen and her room. The animatronics were very realistic though and the CGI was impressive. This movie wasn't for me but if your into FNAF then you'll probably enjoy this film a lot more.Overall, it was repetitive and cringe but I do love a good cringe here and there so it was fine.",2023-10-30
"(Some spoiler warnings nothing very detailed or anything)I literally love this movie to death, I think it was long worth the wait. Definitely my favorite movie ever made in the current moment. I live the script and how some of the parts were just plain out funny, the spring lock scene was super good as well. Overall I LOVED THIS MOVIE. There were some parts that I was hoping for and got in this movie, it was really great. I don't have anything negative with this movie at all, some of the Jumpscares got me a little bit. It was Pg-13 so it wasn't the scariest thing by any means but this movie was made for THE FANS not any person trying to get into the fandom,",2023-10-30

"I hope they keep the movies going in this direction. I've been a FNAF fan since that fateful August 2014. I fell in and out of the fandom throughout 2016-2019 and was very disheartened coming back to the newer games. That being said; I LOVE what they did with this movie. My biggest gripe with the new games was focus on the Afton's over the tragedy of the children. There is no sadder thing than the death of innocent children. The FNAF games are sad, and I was expecting this movie to only be a garbage plot and cheesy gore. I was shocked to see a more mature, more melancholy plot that really showed us that those robots are just kids. They were kids!The movie knows its target audience: kids who grew up with the games who are adults or nearly now. I'm very intrigued with the way they've rearranged the plot. I feel like this is going to be the most cohesive version of the story blending together the game lore and the books to make something really solid. I hope the sequels follow what this movie did right.Even if we disagree on the story, it LOOKED phenomenal. The set was so accurate, and the small references were just--Chica's Magic Rainbow reference, c'mon. The robots (minus the Cupcake) all moved very realistically, and their models were on point.I hope everyone can look at this movie for what it is and not what we wanted or were expecting. Most importantly, my friend and I were EXCITED theorizing where it would go next; what changes will be made? Which I haven't felt in years. So, good job Scott, Emma, and Blumhouse. Keep it going!!",2023-10-30
I love how scott incorporated a bit of both worlds from the books and the games to create this movie and personally it was amazing I loved how they showed how the animatronics were just kids and wanted to have fun whilst keeping the horror aspects and the jumpy scenes that were so out of context really was great as it just brung you back into the games when you would get jump scared out of nowhere. Overall I had an amazing time watching the movie as I have been waiting from the beginning and it will hold a place in my heart and and can't wait for more to come hopefully. Easter eggs too watch out.,2023-10-30
"Scott did a great job for his last project before retiring! I didn't even know the lore till 45 min before the movie I was driving my younger brother to the movie and he did a quick explanation. And now that I have FNAF allllll over my for you page on tik tok. More and more parts of the movie are making sense. May have just gotten myself into fnaf on accident. Seriously though it was a good movie, I didn't even know the animatronics weren't CGI till the end. They did such a good job at creating them! And there were SOOO many plot twists thrown at me, I loved it. May need to create the cupcake as a sculpture soon! Xoxo.",2023-10-30
"They changed some things from the OG lore but they managed to make it acceptable. Now about the jumpscares, there some good jumpscares but some of them where a little cheap. Further more in order to balance the scariness and to much the lore more they should have had more gore. There were also some cringy times like when Abby went with Golden Freedy in a taxi to the pizzaria. Now the lore is still amazing and the most scary about this movie because it dark and leaves you with many questions. Another mistake they did is that they didn't match the FNaF atmosphere very much, for example the pizzaria had more lightning than it should have had. Another thing is that they didn't add the suspense of waiting something to jumpscare you or the suspense tha someone might get hurt or die, there was some suspense but it was rushed. To clarify I mostly mentioned the negative points and not the many of the positive ones so don't get upset about my review.",2023-10-31
"Intro:So.... I had kept up with this guy's theories from Youtube and having him read all the ideas and theories from other people on media about how this movie could be in the production. And so, for the past few months I have been up to date with the rumors of this movie coming out. After finally seeing the trailer out on Youtube, I could not stop talking about it!!!!I had watched it as soon as it came out with my boyfriend, this movie gave him on and off feelings but with me, I simply enjoyed every second of it just because I understood the lore behind it.Review part:With the characters, such as the aunt, her lawyer, the babysitter and her brother. It seemed as though some of them were a sore thumb in this movie due to the game only having the animatronics and the security guard. The aunt character and most of them seemed to have been related to a book. This is sourced by what MatPat was saying (Youtuber). I do like how they added the characters to have a story that goes well with the main idea of Five Nights at Freddy's.With the lawyer guy named Doug. I have no idea who he is but he was unnecessarily funny in some of the scenes.I do agree with almost of everyone who has commented on the actor, Matthew Lillard. He is a great actor as per usual. He really had the best projective voice during his scenes as William Afton. Although there is some hate with his scene and how it wasn't supposed to be that way... etc.There are some parts in this movie with the interaction between Freddy, Chica, Bonnie and Foxy with Abby (Mike's sister) and occasionally with Mike and Vanessa too. It was the only strange scene that I didn't expect. I don't hate it with how they brought that together but it was kinda weird and subconsciously made me trust the animatronics in those scenes. This made it wholesome and funny.With the jump scares, the only ones that seem to commonly get people is Balloon Boy. About three times that he pops up out of nowhere in quiet moments. There is a fourth scare but it was mostly comical but it still made me jump. The main jump scares seem to have lacked a bit than I expected, although the only one I liked out of the other ones were the famous foxy scream, it was an amazing addition to this movie. It brought me back to the FNAF times.The two cab scenes were funny and lighthearted which was a good small bit of the movie.With the end credits, I was off my chair when I heard the theme song, Five Nights At Freddy's by The Living Tombstone!!!! I was so shocked that they added the first song as soon as the credits started to roll. I could not help myself to not sing to that. I loved every minute of it.However.... the second half of the credits towards the end, I heard a robotic voice spelling out ""Come find me"". I believe that's what it was spelling out. I was highly curious of what it meant or what it was referring to. I was hoping in my head that it was just a trick or something to get the audience's attention to make them believe there will be a second part of the movie. I am still trying to process this message.Final thoughts:I personally would've have liked it a bit more if it were pretty much like the game where it's just the security guard looking at the cameras and he has to press the button by the door for it to close but carefully not to overuse the power for it as well as the lights from the two hall ways. It would have made it more immersive to the audience. Maybe that idea would have been too complicated or too boring.I also think if this production blows up with positive algorithms, maybe they could make a part 2 but the third one being the final one. It would be a greater benefit for Scott Cawthon's work and his long years of making after he had retired. (correct me if I'm wrong)In conclusion, despite that I loved this movie, I felt like that this movie was missing something that could have made my review to a 10/10 but I still think this was a great production. The actors did a good job, the set designs were incredible and all of the work.I recommend watching this movie after you played the game(s). Or if you understand the lore.",2023-10-31
"So, after 8 years, Freddy's is finally open for business.Five Nights at Freddy's is the long-awaited adaptation of the horror game series by Scott Cawthon. Josh Hutcherson plays Mike Schmidt, a down-on-his-luck young man who, facing an eviction notice, takes the job working as a security guard at the broken-down Freddy Fazbear's Pizza in order to support his young sister Abby.As someone who was a passive fan of the games and watched people like Markiplier play them, I will say that I really liked the movie. Jim Henson's Creature Workshop did a fantastic job bringing the animatronic band to life down to the tiniest detail. I feel the cinematography also showcased some of the panic-inducing paranoia that the first game was known for.I also think the cast did good for the most part. Huctherson's grief over his personal loss was believable and his relationship with Abby is touching. Piper Rubio also does a very good job in her role as the young sister. Normally I would not care much for child actors, but her interactions with the animatronics is adorable. Vanessa... is serviceable, but I did have some problems there (though she can arrest me any time). And, of course, Matthew Lillard was such a ball in his role.The music was also great with the opening being chilling as it compliments the events of the Missing Children Incident. The movie was also rife with Easter eggs and references which I liked.As someone who was familiar with the games and kept up with them, I think it does the games justice. For everything else...The movie suffers from writing and pacing. The film is 1 hr 50 min, but it felt like it was over too quickly. Definitely not something that felt like it took 8 years to get. Like there is one scene where Mike would be sleeping, then BOOM! Scary thing happens, he reacts, then it jumps to a completely unrelated scene. Instead of taking its time to breathe, the film appears to be in a mad dash to get to the end with some of the more emotional moments being not effective.So... what I did not like and/or neutral on...The film itself is not scary, sometimes feeling like an extended Goosebumps episode which is kind of funny considering the Tales from the Pizzaplex and Fazbear Frights books. While it hits the atmosphere of the game well, it kind of lacks an identity requiring you to be familiar with the games. Like it's just basing it off the popularity of the games rather than coming into its own.I totally get the film was made for the fans in mind, which is fine, and as someone who knows about the franchise, I was satisfied. But I think the film could have done more to make the film accessible to everyone especially with getting some new fans. The worldbuilding was not great with some of its explanations for what things are being brief. For anyone who does not have the slightest idea what FNAF is, this film does it a total disservice.As much as I loved Matthew Lillard here, he felt underused. It is of no issue with him, it's the screenplay's fault. I wish the film would have done something similar to The Silver Eyes where we have Afton giving Mike information on the run-down family entertainment establishment all while slowly building up that his character Raglan was William Afton. I would have even liked if Mike started to befriend Raglan and confiding in him his darkest secrets, which would make the twist of Afton being responsible for the death of his brother Garett even more effective as that betrayal would sting. But, we do have Vanessa already who does some lore drops here and there so I guess that'd be redundant.Don't know about some people, but didn't actually mind how the springlock failure happens though Afton acting like some cartoon character with his reactions to getting impaled are kind of wonky, though since Lillard hams up his performances often, I guess it's a minor gripe. It's more his final line ""I always come back!""It's definitely a cool line hearing it being said after it being such an iconic catchphrase from the games, and even if it felt goofy, again I equated that with Lillard's hamminess. But, again, I feel the line falls flat on anyone not tuned in with the lore. Instead of being an intimidating, final threat of spite, a non-FNAF fan would be like ""What do you mean you always come back? This is the first time I've seen you, I think.""Perhaps also having the Yellow Rabbit periodically stalking Mike would have also been good since that would raise the tensions. We also know little on Afton in this film, but since Lillard had signed up for a three-film deal, maybe more will be revealed in the sequel.Vanessa also felt underutilized. Like I understand that she was someone who had her childhood destroyed by her sociopath of a father, but it made a lot of her previous actions completely confusing. Again, the film could have benefitted from flashbacks to further flesh her out as a character aside from the small ""he really messed you up"" note from Mike. Not helping is the film tipping into predictability. I defy you to say that no one saw Vanessa jumping in to intervene coming after she was all like ""I can't go there, I just can't!""That and the film should have made her being in cahoots with Afton more apparent. He rants saying that he wanted her to kill Mike if he was getting in too deep with unraveling the mystery, but... when was that ever the case? Vanessa acts super sus, but we have no real threads to follow to get the explanation. That, and him saying she was fixing a mess that she started was very interesting. I really wanted to know what he was implying: if we assume that the crying child is canon to this timeline, was she the one who perpetrated the Bite of '83 that made Afton into the crazy serial killer he would become, or was it just referring to this occasion where she did not kill Mike as he demanded?Golden Freddy was done dirty. He was intimidating which was good, but the film does a poor job at introducing him. GF is understood as being a ""ghost"" character of sorts who crashes your game, but the film never goes into the differences enough between him and the other animatronics. He can leave the pizzeria unlike the others and can open and close the doors at will, but we know so little about him. It does such a disservice, it is not surprising anyone not familiar with the series would be unable to tell the difference between Golden Freddy and regular Freddy further compounding on the confusion.The tone also felt inconsistent at times. The kill at the beginning sets the mood well, and we get some of that mood later in the act. The animatronics massacring the crew Jane paid to wreck up Freddy's was horrific especially with what happened to Max, but then the animatronics are all cutesy with Abby (which, yeah, it was because Afton was influencing the animatronics somehow to lull Abby into a false sense of security before getting her stuffed) like with the fort scene. I am not.... completely against it because, while whacky, it reinforces the notion that the animatronics are not truly evil at heart: they are lost, scared ghosts of children who had their lives robbed of them. But Bonnie falling on his back is... kind of silly.Of course, this is a result of the games being somewhat tongue-in-cheek with Scott being a master-class troll, but the humor doesn't really hit well and almost feels like a conglomeration of different scripts that were Frankensteined together. The who gets custody of Abby thing is also not helping matters.The film appears to be at a total loss: it has to cater to a young audience since they play the games or buy the merchandise, but they try to push the envelope as far as they could for a PG-13 film, but doing so causes a total whiplash in tone. It does not know what audience it is trying to appeal to.Despite it all, will say that I came out of the film finding it good. Not great, but nowhere near the trashfire some critics are making it out to be. But even then, I think the movie critics are not totally wrong in most of their points. The movie is flawed and only works for a select audience and maybe can be a gateway for kids to see more horror films and, since they are marketable characters, maybe the film acquired some new fans.The film is an accomplishment having been in development hell for years, but I really wish that the film could have been better. I am not expecting Shakespeare in terms of writing as while good writing contributes to making a movie workable, it is not automatically making it ""good."" Much like the Super Mario Bros. Movie, FNAF 2023 is a simple, predictable story, which is not a complete knock on it as... well, both films had the fans in mind.But with Mario's case, you have 40+ years and supplementary material to work with. FNAF had little to no story when it started off as a simple point and click survival horror game. While I am fine with a simple story, it could have been done so much better and more accessible for everyone besides fans.",2023-10-31
As an old fan of the games since almost day one I can say this to me was an almost perfect adaptation but had a few iffy spots for me. Other than that I loved this movie and it made my fnaf phase very happy. I was pleased with the movie and it went way over any expectations I might have had. Can't wait for the second one to release I'll be waiting! For all the critics saying bad things about this movie it's because they know nothing about the games and just see it as some poor movie unlike fans of the games and books and such. The only problems I had with the movie was a couple things not living up to the standards I expected like most did but nothing too big the movie pleased me.,2023-10-31
"This film didn't disappoint(depending on your expectations). It has a lot of jumpscares which is needed for such horror film/series. The actors acting was on point even with the younglings. The animatronics were spot on accurate to their debut in the games. The ending where William afton gets springlocked was and even the first appearance of the main 4 animatronics were such a scene, THEY EVEN ADDED SPARKY!!! Overall: a great horror film for the FNAF community and other horror fans to enjoy with their friends or family. Despite its eating being PG-13, it will meet or go over your expectations.",2023-10-31
"My boyfriend had some mild expectations for this movie going it, but leaving the movie. We were both astonished by the quality in the story that we had experienced. I have both been added fan to the franchise since we were 11 or 12 and seeing this movie finally come to light meant a lot for us. It exceeded both of our expectations and we were able to have a fun time together. Of course the movie is not perfect but the movie was still awesome. It appears to longtime friends while also bringing in a new audience of viewers. Overall, we both had an amazing time and we would call this the best anniversary we ever had.",2023-10-31
"I think this movie is actually much better than I've been hearing from some of my friends, the story is very much on point, the Animatronic puppets literally look like they jumped straight out of the game, and Freddy Fazbears Pizza looks like a actual abandoned pizzeria that i could go explore. I also liked the costume design of all the characters, and the whole background behind Mike Schmit, I think the directors did a amazing job and I'll definitely buy the movie when it comes out on DVD. Also, I love the fact that we now live in a universe where Shaggy is William Afton! That's all I gotta say. 😁",2023-10-31
"I loved this film, it is filled with different things from each of the games and is very lore accurate, I went to see this film with my sister who doesn't know as much about the game franchise as I and she still understood everything perfectly.This film isn't necessarily ""scary"" but there are a lot of good jump scares throughout, and the cinematography just blew me away.I loved that we got to see two big fnaf content creators within the film, fnaf has such a big community and it was nice to see popular faces!I would 1000000% recommend to watch this movie!!!!! I love the story that goes along with it, and I like how it incorporated things from the books :))) please give this a watch!! You will not be disappointed!!!!! 1I would give 11/10 stars if I could!",2023-10-31
"After watching this in cinemas I felt very confused. The movie was fine don't get me wrong, but it did not live up to my expectations as a long time fan of the franchise. The story was bizarre, it was not scary in any way and the main villain got pretty much no screen time at all. But it isn't all bad, the animatronics and set looked amazing, the acting was pretty good and to be fair I had a fun time watching. Don't go into this movie expecting a scary or gory horror film, but just go in expecting a pretty goofy thriller obviously targeted towards children ages 9-13. Which is fine but I wanted a bit more of a serious movie considering I've been waiting for this movie since 2016. But all in all an ok movie. Nothing special but it's fun to watch.",2023-11-01
I loved the games as a kid and now seeing it on the big screen 2 times as a teenager made me love it even more. Been waiting 8 years for this movie to come out. There was a lot of plot points but in my opinion it makes it better because it keeps you at the edge of your seat because you don't know what's gonna happen next. It showed a good amount of gore that wasn't too heavy or scary it was just good. They did change a lot of the lore but they took a lot from the games and books. I made a check list of stuff I wanted to see here it is. Markiplier and/or Matpat cameos check. Springlock scene check. Someone dies to one of the animatronics check. There is more obviously but I don't wanna be here all day but most of my list was checked. I'm so excited for the next FNAF movie I hope it lives up to my expiations.,2023-11-01
"If you loved FNAF games, if you followed that lore like a crazy person, if you know who MatPat, Markiplier or Dawko are, then this movie is totally for you.Don't get influenced by grumpy people that didn't know what Fnaf was before entering, the movie wasn't for them, and you know what? It's alright!Fnaf delivers everything every fan of the franchise was waiting for.We got the animatronics, we got dead kids, we got Mr. Afton, we got springlocks suits AND a plot that held together pretty well in a 2h movie.It could've been a longer movie, or a first movie in a franchise expending on Scott Cawton's lore a bit more instead of having to condense a lot of the story.",2023-11-01
"In a vacuum, this movie is a 5. As a FNAF movie it's like a 2I wanted to see animatronics murdering people. Instead I was treated to over 2hrs of the security guard's sorry ass sob story and like 2 minutes of freddy and pals actually being violent.As a fan of the game, I got very little of what I actually wanted from this movie and a whole lot of what I didn't want.If you do decide to see this movie, show up 1h30m late because that's when you actually get to see scary animatronics.Oh yeah I guess the robots are possessed by missing children and they want to adopt the security guard's sister and that's why we even have a fight scene at the end. The whole thing is a mess and an hour too long.",2023-11-01
"It's really fun to watch, well i guess some people are hating on this movie because they didn't create a perfect imitation of the original game but i really had fun watching the movie and i hope they would release another one and give more light for golden Freddy and william afton , but yeah i like the fact that they changed the original placement of every character as mike and venessa and abby , so it would be great watching a whole series of a new universe of five night at Freddy's. Anyway i don't know what else to say , today i had a very strange dream like i was on another dimension really.",2023-11-01
"Ok, don't get me wrong here, i didn't think the movie was peak. Lore wise the pretty much got it right but then the content was so limited so they throw in random filler which wasn't the best. Another thing is that the movie is tagged as horror. This is not a horror film. Not in the slightest. 3 jumpscares that actually caught me off guard - all being from bb. I feel like if they'd have tagged it as anything else/close to but not horror it would have changed our perspectives going into it. I liked watching it, it was fun to watch but it was somewhat good as an adaptation. Overall, I enjoyed it and i recommend it especially to all fnaf fans who'd like to see their favorite scene (springlock scene) live action. It's a good movie, not worth 10 stars though, but its also not bad to get 34 metascore.. i feel maybe thats to harsh and it deserves like at least 50 metascore from the critics.",2023-11-01
"Love it! Definitely love it! Though it was kinda less bloody and I guess some of these scenes are kinda gory in some way and then the story is kinda okay and not into lore in my opinion, this is truly what I was waiting for years and totally a one of a kind. This is truly a dream come true that makes me feel like a child again. I kinda dream this movie when I was a child and here we are. An absolutely amazing movie. The visuals are so good and somewhat very enjoyable to watch. Truly a 10 out of 10 for me and definitely l would like to watch it again. The animatronics are cute though and also I love their personalities when they are playing with abby. Love this movie so much.",2023-11-01
"As a fnaf game player for 7 years, I can confidently say that this filled my itch of needing a movie. The lore made perfect sense even to those who don't follow it (probably) would have been more like a 9 star movie instead of a 5.7 rated movie if it was actually violent which I was disappointed about which is my I didn't do 10
Graphics/design =8/10
Story = 10/10
Fnaf =11/10.Hopefully this movie turns into a franchise so they can cost from their mistake of not adding gore, though the scene where William says ""I always come back"" made me wanna dance (you know what I'm talking about). The goriest part was when the springlocks collapsed inside of his stomach in my personal opinion but ignore the lower stars cuz they don't know what they are talking about.",2023-11-01
"This movie was one of the best movies I've ever seen, Blumhouse did a great job and Scott Cawthon too. Mike's actor fit the BEST for the game character and the acting was great too, Abby is very good too and Vanessa to be honest all of the characters were great, I really liked the fact that this movie was especially made for the fans of FNAF. I'm a fan too and seeing this movie was the best experience I ever had at a movie.I dislike the fact that people are giving 1 star reviews to a movie very good made, maybe is not 100% game lore related but remember it was made by Scott so it is perfect.Thank you Scott.",2023-11-01
"As a fan of the original series of games and lore, I loved the movie. I'm not a big fan of gore or horror but I went for the story and nostalgia. Even to me the movie was not necessarily that scary (even though there were plenty of scary scenes for all us scaredy-cats out there.) In fact the movie had a good bit of humor to it (especially since I watched it on Halloween night in the only cinema in my small college town). It does change up the lore a little bit but I haven't met any other fans upset with the changes at all. Cameos and other Easter Eggs just made it even better for longtime fans. I would watch again and also any future sequels! It does change up the lore a little bit but I haven't met any other fans upset with the changes at all. Cameos and other Easter Eggs just made it even better for longtime fans.",2023-11-01
"It was nice to see all the cameos and throwbacks to the game, of course I was not here for the horror, because I knew right from the start when I saw the trailers that the movie is not gonna be scary AT ALL. It was good nonetheless because I had to see all the characters that I knew in love when I played the games come back in the cinematic representation. The best part is seeing William Afton, the character that only gets shown through the stories and the rumors throught the games, he finally got shown in his physical human form! Cheesiness aside, this movie was one big rollercoaster of joy and entertainment for all the FNaF fans!",2023-11-01
"I know the movie isn't accurate to the actual lore that fnaf fans would've expected but somehow this new/changed storyline actually did pretty well to be put in a movie. And yeah, some people say the fnaf movie is bad, because not 'lore accurate"" but they have to understand that it's hard to adapt a lore from a game that doesn't confirm everything what it should have been. I'm actually really satisfied with this movie after 9 years and it reached my expectations. We all have heard the marionette aka puppet music from the second fnaf game that confirms that there will be a second movie. I can't wait to see the second movie already!",2023-11-01
Going into the screening I expected nothing less than another poorly adapted video game. I was surprised coming out because it wasn't the terrible film I had expected. Although I do think a few things were missing namely: You know when Freddy says har har har har har har har har ha that's not even in it. The song that plays when the power goes out doesn't play at all to be honest the overall atmosphere of the film was much less like a horror and more of a crime/drama. This film wasn't creepy or what I expected. It was a fun watch nevertheless kept me guessing throughout. Great tribute to the fans of the game.,2023-11-01
"Great movie.... But the movie does mess with lore that we known for a while, the actors did a great job, animatronics looked like well animatronics, had some good spooks here and there, nice little Easter eggs from the game, had some great cameos from YouTubers, set and props were well made, the CGI looked great, costumes for the animatronics were PERFECT, wish they had some nods to the books and more nods to the history of Five Nights at Freddy', could of had more gore, could of helped with understanding lore better, and it could of had more cameos from people that helped make the community we know today,",2023-11-02
The five nights at freddys movie It was so good I loved it I was so happy after waiting9 years I scream when Willamette afton came on screen I'm just waiting for the 2nd movie u should watch it even after it did bad I waited 9 freaking years for it and it only got a 25%? Naw critics when dirty why 25% i understand it wasn't that scary but more likely it was a thriller but u gotta respect for the 9 years I'm excited for the 2nd movie coming out in 2024 or 2025 I hope the 2nd one dose good u just gotta wait I think 2nd might be scary the first went hard tho and I just love the fnaf movie bye bye.,2023-11-02
"OMG I LOVE THIS MOVIE! Mainly because of josh hutcherson but I think the storyline was good too. I LOVED MATPAT AND CORY KENSHIN IN THE MOVIE i just felt like they were cute little details <3 i feel like they shouldve stuck with the same lore and didnt move stuff around that much because i felt like it wouldve been better that way (not saying this movie isnt good). But i am a fnaf fanatic and i know the lore from head to toe. Abby was literally the cutest idk why everyones hating on her. That part where steven said ""i always come back"" didnt hit tho. I felt like it was too fast </3 but his character was portrayed so well so i guess it evens out. Also LOVED THE LITTLE EASTER EGGS like marionette, purple guy, sparky/lefty (idk) etc. Overall great movie and I LOVE JOSH HUTCHERSON.",2023-11-02
"Honestly the film was good but that's not the vibe of Fnaf. It was too friendship power and all... of course you're gonna tell me that's because it's Pegi 12 but that's the problem the Fnaf community is older we wanted more gore and something accurate to the lore. And also there where like 4 or 5 screamers like ?? That's not Fnaf vibe at all, honestly the movie wasn't scary one bit.Spoilers:
First of all, Vanessa Afton ??? Why ?? This isn't supposed to be that and if it's Vanessa from security breach that's make even less sense.Second of all, the death of Wiliam Afton is too fast and that's not even how he die why the cupcake ??. He is supposed to be alone with the animatronics in a room and put the costume of spring bunny and be crushed because of the humidity.Third of all, the animatronics, they aren't supposed to move in the day so why does they can kill everyone, and I think they move too much, I honestly wanted to see them through camera and like to have an electricity breakdown and seeing the animatronic in a different one maybe not in the whole movie but at least a bit...Forth of all, Mike in the movie got a sister and a brother, and Mike can be the short of Michael technically and he is the security guard so if it was working with the lore it will be making much more sense if Mike where Mike Afton, that is sister die (in the movie or before) because of circus baby and that his little brother was the one having the 83 bite.Fifth of all, we don't have any information about Henry, Charlotte or the bite of 83, Henry could be at least mentioned, Charlotte is super important since she's the puppet and she's the one who helped the child having a second chance in the animatronics and the bite of 83 for me is also very important.I think I said all I had in mind have a good day 🙂",2023-11-02
"This movie has been one of the few that I have been waiting for since the year went by and it made me surprised why it shows so many of the outside of the story and how it affects it. One thing that you may dislike is that it is not so much horror, it is more of a story than adding suspense and it does not try to scare you although *Spoilers* the scene of Freddy attacking is very surprising*End of Spoilers* Overall, it's a movie that I would watch more with my friends. And don't look for violent scenes, there aren't any, but it does have a very acceptable ending. My final opinion is ""watch it if you know about the history of video games"" -this was written with a translator since I don't know the language that much-",2023-11-02
"I don't really understand why everyone seems to hate the movie. It was pretty good for the first movie. Not perfect but good. I waited really long for this movie and I'm not disappointed at all. Maybe they could've added more jumpscares and kills but I'm happy that we've got at least a movie. It doesn't bother me at all that the lore of the movie isn't game accurate, I think it's better that it is more accurate to the books and it's having his own lore. My whole cinema clapped when the movie was over, I was really excited to watch it after all these years. I think hardcore FNAF fans will enjoy the movie but in my opinion it's not a must-watch for everyone else.",2023-11-02
"This was beyond my expectations really great film, im fnaf fan myself for 9 years now and i really loved screen play and the way the atmosphere made me feel scared most of the time. Many critics and ""younger"" fnaf fans will say it wasn't soo good yet again everyone can write crtitic, people who didn't play the game and read the books just won't understand Scott's hard work and eastereggs he put inside of film its all connected to lore but most of the things are changed in film. The film itself is for the fans Scott said, this was the end of my childhood ""the great ending"" i feel most of u feel the same way.",2023-11-02
"I myself am a fnaf fan and took my non fnaf fan best mate and he was amazed with how it was he jumped a few times and so did I, I love a good horror film and considering this is based on the first filmed made me amazed with how good it is, obviously couldn't ask for a better film based on fnaf considering they took 8 months to complete I wouldn't listen to critics go watch the movie for yourself. If your a fnaf fan go watch it, yes there are a few things that are different but it makes the film great. I truly believe and want more films of fnaf so hopefully they create more, they will base it off the second game for the second film and so forth.",2023-11-02
"I see the reviews and the biggest complaints are about a lack of gore and PG13 rating. Most of those reviewers need to get the head out of the sand. The games are made for young children. The movie was made for the fans, not for adults seeking a bloody masterpiece. I'm a huge horror fan but I knew going into this that this is not what to expect. The target audience my 5 and 12 year olds.If you want blood and gore then go watch The Banana Splits movie or Willy's Wonderland. This was made for little kids who faithfully played the games, read the books, studied the lore. The cameos in the movie were YouTubers who did FNAF content for kids. It's extremely loyal to the story with only minor tweaks. I've spent the past 8 years of my life hearing every aspect from each game and book from my kids, every character, every story line. I've been forced to buy FNAF lego sets and plushies and more! They were ready to watch. They loved it, they told me every Easter egg I may have missed. They knew the YouTube content creators as soon as they were on screen. They sang the songs and they cheered when they saw Foxy because he was always the favorite.For the adults watching this movie knowing nothing about the story yet thinking it's just going to be a gore filled masterpiece- you chose poorly. The movie was wonderfully done, but it isn't made for you. Watch and enjoy but don't expect more than a horror movie made for young children. Don't be angry when you don't get gore, violence and sex scenes. You weren't the target audience and no one cares what you think.",2023-10-29
"I've never played the game so I went into this blind, but the ending ""twist"" wasn't hard to figure out early in the movie, nor were any of the other reveals. Would have definitely been nice to get some more info on the connection between the characters, but I understand that would be difficult due to keeping it more suited for younger viewers.I will say this though : that they did NOT give Matthew Lillard enough screen time. He was the best actor in the whole movie by far.All in all, not a horrible movie - it's good for a fright for younger teens. Not a lot of blood or gore, no sexual or adult themes, not even any cursing.",2023-10-27
I went into to this as a fan of the games and lore and was pretty impressed with what they did. Mike's character was fleshed out and honestly liked the daughter being added to the story. The animatronics where scary enough for me I honestly would like to see more made with context from the lore of Fnaf. This was for the fans and I hope we get more to come. Shaggy being the villain was very good and josh was amazing! If you like jump scares there is a lot in the beginning to get you going but it gets lighter as the story progresses. The ending was very lame but it looks to be a set up for another movie.,2023-11-01
This is a fun movie if you go into it not expecting Shawshank Redemption or The Godfather. It's full of references for fans but I can understand why non-fans would have a hard time with it. See it in a theater full of fans if you can. That made it so much more enjoyable.Critics hate it but there's a lot they fawn over that doesn't interest me at all.The production design is great. The animatronics are amazing. They really make the movie.If you're a fan it's a no-brainer to watch this. Some of the plot may be different than what you've come to know with the FNAF games but it's still good as a standalone film.Just watch it.,2023-10-28
"My daughter has been a fan since she was 5 years old. She's 12 now. I took her and my nephew (13) to see it, and they LOVED it. I loved it too. The animatronics looked awesome. There was no sexual stuff. Mild and implied gore. (Shadow of body chopped in half) They stayed pretty true to the lore while mixing in their own story. I guess I could see where some of the critics might be disappointed because they were expecting a gory horror movie, but this was mostly a love letter to the fans. For years, we have been waiting for this movie. We waited as it changed production, as it changed screenplays. Watching it spawn Willies Wonderland and Banana Splits. For years, these kids have been playing the games, buying the merch, reading the books, and watching the Youtubers explain the lore. I love the games, and watching Markiplier play it, watching MatPat explain the lore. The fanbase is huge, and I hope there is a sequel and hopefully a sister location. I think it says a lot more about this specific movie, to hear that the fans love it than to hear from a random critic.",2023-10-30
"I was obsessed with the lore of the video game series. While game play and scares were just fine, it was the tidbits of story sprinkled throughout the games and books and websites that made it stand out. These games maintained longevity on YouTube because of channels like Game Theory piecing the puzzle together as a community. It was exciting.However the movie missed the mark with this. While it kept the story pretty true to the source material, it just felt over-explained. Nothing was left ambiguous. Maybe to appeal to new-comers who don't know the lore inside out like so many fans, or to reach younger audiences, but it made the film feel dumbed down. Like they couldn't trust the audience to figure some things out themselves.The ""twist"" also not that surprising. And a little disappointing they didn't thing audiences would see it coming.",2023-10-27
"1st, I'm not a horror fan and my exposure to FNAF is purely from watching streamers. If you are a fan of this franchise you will enjoy this movie. You can tell the people who made it took care to honor the source material. Given the historic and consistent disappointments we get with video game adaptations as films this was an immensely present surprise. If you are like me and cannot watch horror movies that lean into more violence than spooks this is going to be an easy watch. It was just spooky enough and it didn't subject us to unnecessary gore.Let's talk effects, the fact that this film uses practical effects is mind blowing. The more I learn about the animatronics the more blown away I get. So well done. Absolutely incredible.A enjoyable movie that really took its source material and ran with it. Would recommend.",2023-10-29
"Ok here's what's happening and why the rating is lower overall for this movie... Half the people reviewing it are die hard fans of the video game series, and are shredding it because it doesn't live up to the games or match them close enough or something idk, while the other half is just genuinely going to this movie to see it and enjoy a movie at the theater. I fall into the latter; my take on it? My boyfriend and I loved it. It had great acting, sets, visual effects, sound effects, etc. It captured a creepy unsettling feel without being too over the top scary or gory, and kept you invested in it and the characters the whole time. My advice? Ignore the die hard weirdos who don't understand that video games can't directly be translated onto the movie scene, and just go see this movie. You'll enjoy it. Oh and who doesn't love to see Shaggy still rocking it in some movies? Shoutout Matthew Lillard!!",2023-11-01
"This was an excellent movie if you are a fan of the games. However, if you were looking for horror, go somewhere else. This movie has a great setting, good acting and amazing looking animatronics!What the movies like in scares is come in hot and heavy with the LOREEEEE. Now this movie is not 100% accurate to the actual cannon events in the games. It does however put and interesting twist in a franchise we all know and love. What really sets the bar high is the animatronics themselves.Now sure, they could have had some more gruesome and bloody kills, but of the 5 that were shown, none of them felt forced out of place.Overall it was a good time. Load of discussion can be had with anyone who follows the actually story of FNAF.",2023-10-28
"Got not the heart nor the soul of Tobe Hooper's original movie. One of those modern movies adaptions that will fall quickly into the domain of oblivion. Redundant, generic, a cash grab. Who wants, who needs this, as we can watch the excellent and iconic original one anytime?",2022-02-19
"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise has been an absolute mess for over a decade & to be honest the only good films in the whole franchise is the original 70's Classic & the excellent Early 2000's remake, all other films have been terrible.Now we have another sequel to the first film only that uses the original survivor final girl Sally to face off with Leatherface finally.The characters here are crappy idiots, the new generation of idiots that live for their mobile phones & the popularity that digital love gives them & makes them ""Popular"" or even famous. The group of youngsters move to a crumbling old Texas ghost town to reopen for some business venture but end up getting the attention of serial killer Leatherface. This film is very short & rushed. The characters are not likeable & are those smart-ass ""Woke"" type of idiots & they make the absolute WORST decisions ever. The kids are dumb & deserve to die.The remaining character from the 70's original returns towards the end & she's even DUMBER!!!This old witch-looking hag, Sally, has waited for 50 years to get revenge of Leatherface & when she confronts him while he's sat down without his Chainsaw, she has a shotgun aimed at him but doesn't shoot him????? She could end him right there but of course she's STUPID like everyone in this crap film.The mess is just FRUSTRATING & REALLY DUMB.Another piece of shi# in the messy franchise.",2022-02-21

"Having been sheltered for half a century, Leatherface is back to cause more mayhem.What can you say, I waited ages to see this film, I had really high expectations, kind of like those I had for Halloween 2018, only that was good, this certainly wasn't.I'll start off with the positives, visually it's superb, beautifully shot, with some great location work, and some impressive scenes, I liked the music also, it wasn't overly done.Sadly the positives are few and far between, if you watch the original, and followed it up with this, you'll see what a pale imitation this is.On the downside, firstly, some of the acting isn't up to scratch, at times it had the made for TV feel about it, it perhaps doesn't feel deserving of the title.The characters are just awful, Leatherface just seems so out of sorts, and as for the crows of youngsters seeking a better life, they're all just loathsome, none of them have any redeeming features. That scene where they all pull out their phones.... I know what I thought.Fortunately it's not a long film, at just over ninety minutes.Had the potential to be a good watch, it wasn't, 4/10.",2022-02-20
"It's been almost 50 years since the original massacre. Trendy chef Dante (Jacob Latimore) and business partner Melody (Sarah Yarkin) are traveling to the emptying town of Harlow, Texas to set up a hip new community. Dante brings his girlfriend Ruth. Melody brings her sister Lila (Elsie Fisher) who is withdrawn after a shooting incident. Dante tries to take down a Confederate flag from an empty orphanage but a cranky old lady claims to still own it.This old franchise grinds out another sequel. It's going to be one of the forgotten ones. There is plenty of gore but there is nothing memorable. I don't particularly care about any of these characters. Liberal hipsters are an annoying breed of stereotypes when they're written like this. I don't care if they live or die. There isn't much rooting interest and therefore the tension is simply not there.",2022-02-22
"Sally too emerges aft 50 years hibernation only to be thrown in a dumpster.In Leatherface (2017), they showed a boy in an orphanage n how this boy descended into madness n later went on to become Leatherface. It was a true origin story n i liked it cos of its avoidance of tropes. The 2017 version has amazing star cast who gave memorable performances. It has top notch cinematography n heart pounding tension.In this installment, Leatherface is hiding/hibernating after the events of the original 1974 version. How can u hide or hibernate for 50 years?How is Leatherface still fit n healthy?And how conveniently the chainsaw is hidden in the wall for all these 50 years without spoilage or rust.And since when did Leatherface became supernatural?How he survived those shot gun shootings n chainsaw attack is beyond me.Generous with a 4 cos of its attachment n some very brutal scenes.The two scenes, the hammer hitting the leg n the cop's elbow being broken, gave me creeps.The face being smashed into pulpy watermelon was too much for me.",2022-02-19
"Slasher used to be a genre to look for in the early 2010s. I don't think it anymore is. Lately, Slasher's have had poor writing, limited thrills, a nothing story, but only Blood. One thing used to be common, a group, and one human left alive.In this, they haven't largely covered the antagonist. They never tried to show his side of the story. Who, why, there was nothing. Only, a group of friends got attacked by a maniac. I don't think that's how a movie works. You need to have tent poles, a side for the antagonist, a superior plot, good writing.Having a fancy name, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, doesn't make a movie great.I'd recommend not to watch.",2022-04-03
"The ninth installment of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (TCM) franchise and a sequel to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), while effecting a retcon of all previous sequels.No wonder why Legendary Pictures sold this film to Netflix, they knew if they released it in theaters, they won't even getting back the production budget.Even though I enjoyed the whole vibe of the film, it overtakes Leatherface (2017) as the worst TCM film in the franchise. I never expected this from Fede Álvarez, he should've never picked this newbie screenwriter and director with no prior experience handling valuable IPs like this.",2022-02-19
"Whenever I watch a Texas Chainsaw Massacre sequel, I realize what makes the original 1974 film so iconic. This 2022 sequel is also a completely forgettable one, ideally made for instant consumption with not much to read into. The script is a bland mess - there's zero depth to any of the characters, including Leatherface himself. It doesn't even bother to show that Leatherface has been living in hiding all these years because he pops up exactly when you expect him to, unlike in the original where you gasp for a few moments. If you haven't watched the original, it will simply seem like a big, bulky guy randomly going on the run with a chainsaw in hand, chopping people. In my eyes, there's no Leatherface without the Sawyer family.Where it does score a little is in the gore department. Some kills end up being a lot bloodier than you might think. But the payoff is so little I couldn't care less for any of the characters or the surface-level social commentary it offers. The bus scene is a gory delight, serving up a couple of minutes of good, old-fashioned slice & dice. The Sally Hardesty subplot is a replica of what they tried to do with Laurie Strode in the Halloween sequels, sans any texture. I loved Elsie Fisher in Eighth Grade, but this film doesn't even attempt to get anything out of her. The atmosphere too, didn't evoke Texas enough. I'm not exactly interested in another sequel to this, but I'd still watch it because of its connection to the original.",2022-02-18
"TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE (2022) is the latest in a line of blood-draining (pun intended) Hollywood exercises in futility. Thankfully, I was able to watch this movie immediately with a Netflix subscription instead of wasting my time in the theatre. How is it possible for modern writers to keep aiming so low and going even below THAT? I just saw Halloween Kills a few months ago and at the time, that was the dumbest collection of characters I've seen a horror movie in years, but the ones in this film take the cake. This movie is loaded with cliche after cliche of characters saying dumb things and making dumb decisions, or simply doing nothing. The 4 main characters are all forgettable and annoying. I've actually the 2 actresses playing the sisters in other stuff and they aren't the worst I've ever seen, but when writing is this bad, no amount of decent acting can save it. And I wouldn't even call the acting decent in this. More like non-existent.First things first, what were they wearing? Lol Is this how young people dress nowadays? I'm no fashion designer but even I know when outfits look like a person just threw some crap together and called it a day. To the dumb decisions we go. Why didn't the main quartet of influencers drive off at the gas station when they were done? They just stuck around long enough for main girl to antagonize the Texas local, who as it turns out was their contractor at the ghost town. Why did the blonde girl volunteer to go with the old lady to the hospital? That's not her responsibility or fault she had a heart attack. Just give the Sheriff your number and they can call you or text you to let you know how she is. How did Leatherface magically transport himself from the upstairs to inside the back of the police van?After the crash, why didn't blonde girl get the Sheriff's gun while Leatherface was putting together his mask? Even better, get the gun and get out and start running. Why did contractor guy take the bus keys and punish the guests? If he thinks they took over the old lady's house illegally, just quit working and leave to contact the authorities and let them handle it. Why did main girl mess around upstairs so long? Just climb out a window, you're only on the second floor. And during her what felt like hours under the bed, why didn't she grab the contractor's gun while he and Leatherface were fighting?Then there's all the cliche female badassery (1) The younger sister character with her cliche 1-dimensional trauma that she must overcome so she can be the final girl. I couldn't care less. (2) The final girl from the original 1974 movie is Sarah Connor 2.0 in her twilight years. Instead of being traumatized and going far away, she spends 50 years of her life hunting Leatherface and then when she finds him, makes dumb decision after dumb decision. I thought with age comes wisdom. Apparently not this woman. She's got 2 innocent girls in the back of her car and decides to use them as bait. Some hero. Then there's the cliche gun won't shoot right when you need it the most. And at the end, the main girl barely scrapes Leatherface on the head and instead of cutting him up into bits and pieces with the chainsaw, her and her dumb younger sister opt to just stand there and stare at him as he submerges in some shallow puddle of water.On the plus side, the action got going pretty fast in this movie as it didn't waste time with the killing. The minus side is that meant I had to watch cliche horror movie characters being dumb for a full hour. Don't let the short running time fool you. This movie is one of the longest 1 hours, 20 minutes of my life. When I don't have the patience to sit through a barely over an hour movie, you know it's bad.",2022-02-24

"I was honestly quite impressed with the cinematography, production, and pacing of the first half, despite the silliness of the plot that was clearly a way of setting up a smorgasbord of fodder for Leatherface. And boy does he take advantage. Though the humanization of the character was palpable and refreshing, that all disintegrates in the second half, where the movie follows every horror trope and then one-ups it with the stupidest decisions, most obvious plot holes and a laughable absence of realism. In the first half however we have your typical local hick who's expected to be one of the antagonists but lo and behold he's actually a great guy. Many of the shots, especially the scene in the sunflower field, were just shy of beautiful in a grisly way. The whole bus scene was both funny in a satirical way, disturbingly gruesome, and yet what preceded it made absolutely zero sense. If only the flick stuck to its guns with the deviations from horror norms, it could've been a solid installment in this cesspool of a series.",2022-02-20

"This was one of the worst things I've ever seen. Like, I don't even know if this can count as a movie. The only thing they did successfully was waste your time.These characters were so annoying. They think they can just set up shop in the middle of Hicksville as these dandy, overly sensitive, self righteous, 20 year olds and make an art community? Were we supposed to be on Leatherface's side? Because it worked. I couldn't wait for him to kill these Gen Z idiots who look out of place not looking down at their phones. Who, ever seeing someone with a gun, would make fun of that person that's a foot away? I've seen people carrying guns and making fun of them, out loud was the last thing I wanted to do.The entire set up was so dumb. This movie was written around the kills and they weren't even set up very well. So the old lady dies and the most annoying girl wants to go with her? Why? For what purpose? And then the other girl goes instead? Why? For what purpose? Why does anyone have to go with her? I guess to have a main character die when Leatherface becomes unhinged?Leatherface is cutting that guy's face off in a field for some reason and then pops up to kill the cop, who just woke up and somehow doesn't see the girl moving or hear her talking? Then he comes back like two minutes later to kill her?The whole deed to the house thing and that they ""killed her"" was one of the dumbest plot points I've ever seen. This gets the whole movie going and this is the best they could come up with? Not only does this set off the characters but also that they didn't really have it? What the hell did that even mean? They didn't go back to it.Why didn't people leave town after that dude was running around with his face ripped open? They're just like, ""That's weird. Nothing is going to take us out of this party bus."" I'm not even going into their massacre on the bus thing with the phones... I just can't do it.He has to get the original chainsaw from 50 years ago? And it still works? Now I'm no chainsaw expert but I'm pretty sure it would be dead. Why does it even matter? He can't just have a chainsaw? Just for nostalgia.The cop? ""You have to stay until I kill him."" She couldn't give them the keys? Then Leatherface gets past her and her shotgun, somehow and then she saves the day, gives them the keys and tells them to leave. What? And then she just gets killed!? The old lady is still alive somehow? Didn't he chainsaw all the blood out of her? They set her up and then knock her down just as fast.It seems like there was supposed to be a lot of story about the girl that survived the school shooting. But instead it's a side comment that they spend almost no time on. So when she ""uses a gun"" it's supposed to be a big deal?Why did the two most annoying looking people survive? And they're sisters? They didn't look related.Why did they kill off everybody so fast when they came up with the most insane ways for them to get out of situations? If they kept some of those people around it would have made for more to happen instead of keeping the old lady alive and saving the day twice.The ending? Like there couldn't be one? She has to scream while being driven away. And by autopilot? That's the whole reason this is in the movie? Just for that shot? Their screams were even annoying as all hell.And they really stretched those credits out to make it the 80 minutes that it was. They are 9 minutes by the way.Was anybody thinking when they wrote, or shot or edited this?The worst part about this is that it was ripping off the Halloween ""reboot a sequel"" and managed to do an even worse jobThese ""sequels to the original"" are nothing more than fan movies that have the rights. All they do is give the writers a chance to recreate the original so they can satisfy their thirst for nostalgia. Isn't the point of making a sequel to the original to correct all the mistakes of the sequels? But instead they make something that fits in perfectly with all the other sequels. I guess proving the point that you shouldn't make sequels to these movies. I don't know why people even see these then. Just stop giving them money and they'll stop making them.",2022-02-21

"If there's one thing this new Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie has in its favour, it's the violence: this has got to be the most gory of the series thus far, Leatherface using his signature power tool and trusty lump-hammer to rip, tear and smash his way through numerous obnoxious hipsters. The excess of blood and guts helps make one be a little bit more forgiving about the terrible script, which features plot holes and dumb moments galore.Directed by David Blue Garcia (no, me neither), the film is a follow up to Tobe Hooper's '74 original and conveniently ignores every other movie in the franchise. Fifty years after Sally Hardesty escaped the cannibalistic clan in the first film, a group of young entrepreneurs travel to the Texan ghost town of Harlow with plans to gentrify the place by turning it into a trendy retreat for urbanites. On arrival, they discover an old woman (Alice Krige) living in one of the supposedly vacant properties-an orphanage; despite the woman's protestations that she still owns the deeds, the youngsters call the authorities to have her evicted, which causes the old dear to collapse. An ambulance is called to rush the woman to hospital, the geriatric patient accompanied by her hulking 'son', who just so happens to be good ol' Leatherface, who has been in hiding for the past five decades. En route to the hospital, the old woman dies, which drives Leatherface to kill everyone in the ambulance before returning to Harlow (now wearing his mother's face) to punish the interlopers.So where does this one go wrong?Firstly, Leatherface living in an orphanage: surely a retirement home would be more apt, since the cannibalistic killer would be well into his 70s by now. Somehow, he's still the size of a bull and quicker than a rattlesnake-must have something to do with his all-meat diet. Giving Leatherface a reason to start killing again is also a mistake: since when did he need an excuse to bust out his trusty Poulan 306a (which, for some reason, he has walled up in his room)?I can't say I liked any of the cast enough to not want to see them die. They're a pretty unlikable bunch so most of the time I found myself rooting for Leatherface, which detracts from the sense of dread and horror. The film's final girls, sisters Melody (Sarah Yarkin) and Lila (Elsie Fisher), spend so much of the time bickering with other, I longed for Leatherface to shut them up. Lila's back story - she's a survivor of a school shooting - felt like an unnecessary addition (a failed attempt at commentary on gun control?).The film's highlight - the brutal massacre of a bus-full of partying investors - is spoilt by a stupid spot of social satire, wherein the soon-to-be-dead revellers hold up their phones to post Leatherface's appearance on social media. It's so out-of-place, it ruins the impact of an otherwise excellent scene.Perhaps worst of all is the reappearance of Sally Hardesty (Olwen Fouéré), now a Texas ranger dedicated to finding and killing her nemesis. After fifty years of searching for Leatherface, she finally has the maniac in her sights, her shotgun levelled at his head, but instead of pulling the trigger she totally blows the moment by talking to the killer, giving him the opportunity to escape. She pays for this mistake when Leatherface shoves the business end of his saw into her gut, which trivialises her survival in the first film.It's a shame that there are so many dumb moments, because when Garcia gets it right, the film is a blast: the blonde girl in the ambulance, pretending to be dead so that LF won't kill her; mechanic Richter (Moe Dunford) getting his head reduced to a pulp; Melody trapped in a crawlspace, with Leatherface sawing through the floorboards (and a waste pipe that deposits its disgusting contents in the poor girl's face!); and the bus-load of gore. All great.5/10. The good and the bad cancel each other out, leaving a fair to middling movie overall.",2022-02-20

A made for Netflix TV Texas Chainsaw Massacre sequel for the new Gen-Z audiences.Leatherface abandons his STIHL 066 Magnum and Husqvarna 359. I think Leatherface is now using a Ryobi gas powered chainsaw. Even Leatherface is affected by this economy.,2022-02-19
"New to Netflix is THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE (2022), the latest sequel to the original Tobe Hooper classic that ignores all of the other movies and goes back to basics. And I mean that literally, because this is in all respects a very basic slasher movie in which Leatherface goes on a random rampage for spurious reasons, working his way through a hip young cast of 'influencers' who bring a 21st-century spin on the proceedings.The problem with this film is that it's so generic. Leatherface could easily be replaced with Jason Vorhees here, he's just a hulking killer. There's none of the eerie documentary feel that the original had, and I always felt that Leatherface was just one member of a family, so it's a shame he's focused on here so exclusively. What they do instead is bring back heroine Sally from the first film, albeit in the guise of another actress given that Marilyn Burns died some years back. Sadly she'd been retconned into a Sarah Conner post-T2 copy, kicking ass but adding very little to the narrative. It was nice to see old timers Alice Krige (SLEEPWALKERS) and William Hope (ALIENS/HELLRAISER 2) pop up, but their roles are minor.What we're left with in this one is pure gore, and if you're into copious bloodletting then you'll enjoy this on a superficial level; the chainsaw certainly gets a workout, which is weird given that it's been sitting unattended for half a century and yet it fires up first time. But that's just one flaw of a film loaded with them. Which leaves this a movie which lives up to the title, but doesn't offer a single thing more than the grue. It's not one you'll come back to.",2022-02-21
"Original The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) is an Horror cult classic. One of my favorites of all time.Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2022) is just a weak, lazy B-slasher, with the usual predictable script and horrible acting. The best of all, is a bunch of hipsters slaughtered by Leatherface.There are only a few great gory scenes (bus one is my favorite) and the idea of getting back the only survivor from the original movie, doesn't work because of the pathetic script. Could have been far better. That's all. Anything else sinks by itself.So, overall a wasted opportunity this time by Fede Alvarez, to create something decent like the 2003 version, my second favorite of the saga.",2022-02-19
"A group of four friends Melody (Sarah Yarkin), Melody's sister Lila (Elsie Fisher), Dante (Jacob Latimore), and Dante's girlfriend Ruth (Nell Hudson) travel to the deserted city of Harlow, Texas with Melody seeking a fresh start for her sister Lila after her surviving a school shooting and also seeking to re-invent the town as a resort destination after having acquired it for cheap from the bank. The town has two residents a woman (Alice Krige) and her son (Mark Burnham) at the local orphanage who refuse to vacate claiming to be the rightful owners of the property. Calling the sheriff to remove the alleged squatters the woman begins to exhibit deteriorating health and the sheriff, Ruth, and the woman's son head off to the nearest hospital to find help. When the woman dies, her son goes into a vengeful rage killing the sheriff, Ruth, and his deputy and he takes the skin from his mother's face revealing him to be the killer from the unsolved Texas Chainsaw Massacre 50 years ago and who now seeks vengeance on Melody and her friends blaming them for his mother's death. Sally Hardesty (Olwen Fouere) receives word of Leatherface's re-emergence and heads to Harlow to end him once and for all.Texas Chainsaw Massacre marks the latest attempt to revive the Texas Chainsaw IP following the lapse in Millennium Media's rights after the troubled development and release of 2017's Leatherface prevented any further sequels produced by Millennium. Legendary Pictures purchased the IP in 2018 with Fede Alverez of the Evil Dead remake and Don't Breathe signing on as a producer. The movie was a troubled production with original directors, Andy and Ryan Tohill being fired following disagreements with the producers leading to replacement David Blue Garcia. Further bad press was generated when rumors circulated regarding poor test screening s which Alverez flat out denied and then the reveal that the film would be skipping a theatrical release and sold to Netflix. Netflix did surprising little to promote the film with no trailer released until January 31 for the film and the trailing receiving a rather mixed response, particularly for the ""Bus scene"" prominently featured in the trailer that is clearly intended as the film's big money moments with a rather stupid joke about the social media age. After viewing the film, Texas Chainsaw Massacre '22 isn't a trainwreck, but I almost wish it was because as bad as Texas Chainsaw 3D and Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation were, they were at least fascinatingly bad. TCM '22 falls in line with entries like Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III, the Platinum Dunes remake, or Leatherface (2017) in that their competent, but they're just ""there"" and nothing more.In terms of the filmmaking it looks and feels like a Texas Chainsaw movie and even falls in line with the cinematography of the original 1974 film. The work on the older Leatherface for his mask and costume looks nicely filthy, wet, and disgusting, and the dilapidated town of Harlow in theory is a decent setting for this type of movie. I also thought Elsie Fisher was good as Lila and thought she was the most resonant character who fit well in the role.In terms of the rest of the movie, it's pretty underwhelming. The other three characters in the group aside from Lila are just bland and forgettable and the bus full of prospective investors are basically just walking blood bags waiting for Leatherface to cut through them. Even the return of an older Sally Hardesty played by Olwen Fouere is underwhelming because despite Fourere's best efforts and doing her best to succeed Marilyn Burns the character is basically a less fun version of Dennis Hopper's Lefty Enright from Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and she makes some pretty stupid decisions in the movie (like having Leatherface at gunpoint and NOT pulling the trigger because she's shocked he doesn't remember her) and you probably could've easily written that character out with little effort and merged her role with the established character of Richter who's given much more prominence. It's clear the take on the character is inspired by Blumhouse's Halloween series, but it lacks the polish of them (the first anyway). And once again, the movie makes the mistake of trying to play Leatherface as ""sympathetic"". Granted the movie never goes as far as Texas Chainsaw 3D did when he became an anti-hero victim of mob justice, but the movie frames Leatherface's rampage motivated by the death of his mother with a certain level of ""righteousness"" and that's not how you create a monster you should be scared of. The movie has some pretty on the nose satire about gentrification (such as ""the Bus scene"") and it's pretty toothless when you're trying to play both sides as equally valid when one side has a man in hiding who ate people and turned their remains into furniture and wind chimes. I will say that I'm glad they didn't do yet another rehash of the Dinner Table scene, with the exception of Texas Chainsaw 3D that Dinner Table scene has been referenced in every single TCM film, so at least the filmmakers had the knowledge that another take would've been beating a dead horse.Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2022 is just more of the same. The best Texas Chainsaw follow-up remains Tobe Hooper's over the top comedy sequel Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and I think that speaks to how little meat there is to this franchise that the only way Hooper thought it could continue was by turning it into a bloodspattered take on The Three Stooges. The movie's not scary, it's mildly atmospheric, and Elsie Fisher is okay as Lila, but the movie has the same problems as other attempts to revive a series that keeps getting revived only to die a few minutes afterwards.",2022-02-18

"I've been looking forward to this for a while, but to be honest, Netflix is so underwhelming, that I never set my expectations too high...and that trend continues, because this was garbage.What an anti-climax!Non-sensical premise about some influencers buying some land, or something. But they only go to check it for the first time, literally 10 minutes before investors come to view the place? And they only have ONE man working to fix the place up...a man they've 'never' met before. Except, they meet him at the start of the film, but have no idea who he is! WHAT???I may be wrong, but that's the plot I deduced from watching. I had to stop halfway through...just to take a breather, because watching this started to become really grating.No real storyline to speak of. Just a rushed set-up. No backstories for any of the main characters, apart from one having a few flashbacks now and then.Really unlikeable characters, that you honestly won't want to root for.Boring, repetitive and 'done before'.The only good thing I can say, is that it had some really, really good practical effects.",2022-02-18
"How one movie can be that bad is beyond me. The writers were high that's for sure.This movie, especially the last scene, was an insult to the viewers. So he was hit by a car, shot 3 times, cut by a chainsaw and didn't die huh? So they could continue to make this c...py sequel? I personally felt insulted and trolled. Up until the moment the old lady literally stood face to face and didn't shoot him and instead went all Heisenbergy (say my name stuff), I had a little hope. You know, I thought it is a s...y horror movie, just watch it. But after that moment I was furious. They literally asked for it and the guy gave them what they deserved. I wish he did the same thing to all the writers of the film. Please respect yourself and don't watch it. It is worse than the worst.",2022-02-19
Terrible storyline. Stupid script. Poor acting. Another generic garbage from Netflix. Nothing close to the thriller of the original one. Don't waste your time.,2022-02-20
"If you watched the original movie and sequels you'd know Leatherface was part of a freak family but they were all very much human and did not have supernatural strength or immortality. Now at 70 plus years old he can't be hurt or killed and he can rip off hands with no effort. Setting that aside this was a ridiculous script full of wokeness, insulting stereotypes and unlikeable characters. Of course every one makes stupid choices and the story twists and turns are not interesting. Typical of franchises that sell out.",2022-02-20
"So it seems like horror sequels reboots are popular as of late. But unlike other endevours like Halloween or Candyman, I didnt feel like this film really added anything of note. In fact, it was incredibly annoying, stupid and lazy.I couldnt tell who the screenwriters intended on being the protagonist. Because the film starts off with Lila (Elsie Fisher) and makes it out like shes the important character to look out for. But then she's sidelined for most of the film. She doesnt really do anything until the third act. Her sister Melody (Sarah Yarkin) seems to get more of the actual focus and action scenes. But also they very early introduce that Sally Hardesty is back (now played by Olwen Fouéré) and seems quite obvious that the screenwriters were inspired by Jamie Lee Curtis role in the 2018 Halloween, as this survivor who is still obsessed with the killings decades prior and will stop at nothing to finally catch the killer. But again, they dont actually do anything with this character til like the third act and her ""big moments"" dont feel earned at all. And the characters seriously make some dumb decisions. And like ok, I get theres a lot of cliches in horror films. But some of them were just truly mind boggling to me. Theres one point where Melody wants to get out of the town because of the bad juju shes sensing. And her first choice to leave is the party bus that the investors came on. Like, why not take the car you came on? You're gonna drive away with your sister on an entire party bus, and what....leave all your investors stranded? And then the keys get taken away (because the plot needs it to) and they act all like ""Oh no, what will we do"" and again, may I point out to you the car you came in.If you like horror movies for the kills/gore....great. This movie does deliver on that aspect. And I think Sarah Yarkin was pretty captivating onscreen. She's the only one who really stood out to me. But again, I think its because they mostly gave her character something to do.The movie definitely teases future possible sequels....but ehhh not interested if this is the kind of quality we're gonna get. This is an easy skip imo.",2022-02-19
"It was just totally unnecessary. Reboots and sequels are only worth doing if you have an interesting story to tell. This didn't.It also didn't have interesting or likeable characters which is a issue too.It did have interesting shots that I enjoyed, I loved looking at the wide shots of creepy dusty roads that are empty.The sequel element just fell flat for me. I'm not some huge fan of the original or anything but why connect them? It doesn't have the impact that it was thinking it was gonna have. It wanted to be like Halloween (2018) but you can't when your lead died nearly 10 years ago. But don't worry because they brought back the original narrator? So that makes it like Halloween right?I get that IP's make money and this wasn't a terrible movie or anything. It was well made...but it just doesn't have anything new or fresh to say or show.",2022-02-18
"I don't know what everyone is complaining about, this was not bad at all.It's a splatter fest, with some pretty twisted kill scenes. It's not Shakespeare. No intelligence is required.None of the characters are particularly likeable and in classic Horror movie lore, that means a grizzly demise.I gave it a 6/10 which in all honesty is a great score for a B Movie splatter fest.",2022-02-21
"Because theres no other reasons or this to even exist.It was so badly written that against all sense he first person you think might be leatherface, IS leatherfaceIt jumped into the killing ridiculously early without attempting to try and establish a decent storyline, all you get is, and im just theorising here because its not even that clear, a bunch of townies on some sort of stupid showcase trip to try and gentrify a ghost town.Because that happens all the time.From there it hits all the hallmarks of the genre, multiple females making really bad choices, and guys who are even worse at protecting them.Theres nothing to see hereYou wont care about any of the characters, none have any redeeming qualities.Go and watch the original, released when i was a teen, and forget this exists.",2022-02-18
"In a world of hot tags and listicles that opine on the worst sequels ever made, worries over whether this movie is too woke or not enough woke, and the argument that it's either the worst or best movie, the truth is movies are awesome because you make your own mind up -- do it, it's great -- as to what a good or a bad movie is.My opinions are just that. Mine. And Texas Chainsaw Massacre is as good a slasher as we're going to get in 2022, which is a left handed compliment. But it's also not a good Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie. But then again -- but, but and but -- there haven't really been that many good sequels to the original.Taking a page out of Halloween, this movie asks you to wipe your memory clean of the first sequel -- Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, much like Halloween 2, is one of my favorites and asking you to forget it and making this film attempt to supersede it is a tall order -- and establishes a new timeline, the fourth timeline for this series.Let's break it down, with a tip of the bloody flesh mask to Bloody DIsgusting:Original: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III, Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The New GenerationRemake: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, The Texas Chainsaw MassacreReboot: Leatherface, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Texas ChainsawLegacy: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, this movieOf those movies, I can tell you that the original is, obviously, a movie that blows away any movie that will ever be in this franchise. Yet I adore the audacious middle finger that is Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and the WTF Illuminati heart of Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The New Generation. The other films, well, they make each new release better with how bad they get.After the release of Leatherface in 2017, Lionsgate had plans for five more sequels, which frightens me, but the studio lost the rights. Legendary got them and had Fede Álvarez and Rodo Sayagues(whose Evil Dead is considered a good remake and their Don't Breathe did well at the box office) to write and produce a sequel. Ryan and Andy Tohill were set to direct, but were replaced by David Blue Garcia (Tejano) who made this from a script by Chris Thomas Devlin (this is his first movie).Much like every sequel made in the 2000s, this was made in Eastern Europe, with Bulgaria doubling for Texas.Mark Burnham plays the sixty-year-old -- at least! -- Leatherface and Olwen Fouéré takes over for Marilyn Burns as Sally Hardesty, who should probably be yelling ""Evil dies tonight"" as she's the exact same character as Laurie Strode in Halloween and Halloween Kills.Entrepreneurs Melody (Sarah Yarkin) and Dante (Jacob Latimore) have decided to transform Harlow, Texas into a new Austin, bringing along Melody's sister and survivor of a school shooting Lila (Elsie Fisher) and Dante's girlfriend Ruth (Neil Hudson). While working with one of the locals, a gun owner and total opposite to these characters named Richter (Moe Dunford), the team works to clean up the town before investors arrive. That means kicking out an older woman, Mrs. Mc (Alice Krige, a welcome actress any time), who dies moments after being evicted, bringing her charge Leatherface (Mark Burnham, Lowlife) out of hiding as he rides with her to the hospital. Yes, it doesn't go well. Yes, he goes wild on everyone. Yes, it's actually pretty great and the kills look cool, thanks to some solid practical effects.From then on, Leatherface gets his saw and becomes a killing machine, even referencing Jason, seeing Mrs. Mc's face as he goes wild on a bus full of influencers -- no matter how much I dislike some of this movie, it's hard to hate a film in which multiple social media types get gorily dispatched -- and stalks the sisters.Let's get the good out of the way: the wokeness of this movie, which so many worried and gnashed and argued, is just to set the table. And the closing credits look astounding, showing a visual style and color palette that should have informed the entirety of this movie. And hearing John Larroquette introduce the movie makes me so happy.But here's my problem: every other good Texas Chainsaw has made you physically sick thanks to the decay and rot and bone and gristle and, well, cannibalism on display. The set of Chainsaw Massacre 2, a Civil War theme park that has died and been resurrected as a bone-strewn temple to putrified flesh, and the original farmhouse are horrifying places. Indeed, the first Chainsaw is a movie that would have no interest in being part of, a torture test for cast and crew that they barely survived with their lives and sanity.This movie has none of that, substituting geysers of arterial blood for the really disgusting stuff. And when you think of it, there's not much gore in the first movie. We all know that, actually. Yet it remains filled with menace and makes you feel that feeling just on the edge of throwing up when you find a dead animal half-eaten on your porch. It's visceral, it has staying power, it's the end all be all that all horror that came after must compare itself with.Beyond referencing Friday the 13th, this film feels so oddly familiar in the way that it recycles imagery. The hands of the influences trying to escape is very Dawn of the Dead. I could handle that reference if two scenes didn't feel completely cribbed from The Strangers: Prey at Night. The sisters being trapped in a bus bathroom and the aftermath of them crashing the truck are so close to that movie -- which I realize not many people saw -- that it can't be a coincidence.The close of the film erases what has been so important to the first two films: the catharsis of one character barely escaping, as she screams in terror or victory over those who had oppressed her. I get it -- the survivor in this film is no Sally or Stretch. But the whole point of the ending feels lost for a gotcha ending. And the post-credits sequence is relatively pointless.It's strange that for a movie that claims to erase the sequels, this feels a lot more like the 2003 The Texas Chainsaw Massacre than a brave new take on the series. This is the new way that movies happen. Speak badly about everything in the past, then do the exact same thing. If it worked for Michael and Jamie Lee...It really has no idea what it wants to say. If Lila has gun trauma, she gets over it really quick when she has to. There's never a conflict there. There's only an alpha predator senior citizen with a chainsaw and enough badly sketched blood-filled victims to dispatch.I kind of laugh at the audacity that the filmmakers claimed that they used old lenses to get the look they wanted while wasting Daniel Pearl footage at the beginning of this movie. But hey -- the original movie was art. Everything else has been a cash-in, either feeding the direct video appetite or now, the need for new movies to stream.Then again, was this ever meant to be a slasher? The original exists before the slasher and this goes more for straight up murder and less stalk and slash. I mean, far be it from me to decry the genre that I've watched hundreds of movies within, right?And hey -- Leatherface isn't even the scariest Sawyer family member. This movie forgets that.There's enough here to like, but not when you can just do it right and watch good slashers in the short time we have on this Earth.",2022-02-19

"I admit that I went into this with low expectations because of a few bad online reviews but it wasn't nearly as bad as I'd heard and I actually quite enjoyed it.I'm not one to focus on plot holes, as if you watch a movie where someone wears other people's faces to butcher everyone then it's not going to be completely true to life.

The cast was okay and the whole woke thingness but most of the characters i didnt care much for, so didnt care about their deaths really. I was surprised by the sister's survival, even Mel didnt make it (why i was not surprised: they just knocked Leatherface down, did they really think he died lmao? Why didnt they shoot him or something)
And the storyline with Sally seemed so anticlimactic - I know they badically copied Laurie Strode from Halloween reboot - but her dying didnt make any sense. Why bring her back, if shes just gonna die (in a dumb way too) like.. ok.",2022-02-18
"A group of young friends arrive in a remote, largely-deserted Texas town. The area is known for being where Leatherface murdered several people with a chainsaw nearly 50 years previously. He can't possibly still be in the neighbourhood, right?I'm generally not a fan of horror movies but enjoyed the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974). It had a wonderful rawness and authenticity to it that amplified the terror. So good it essentially created all the standard horror plot devices that are now very clichéd.There were several remakes or sequels but none measured up to the original. They generally had some redeeming qualities though with the 2003 version (starring Jessica Biel) being the best of the bunch. The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1994) was terrible though.My first reaction to discovering there's now another version (a sequel) was ""Why?"". There's been several already and none came close. Not only is the market saturated with Texas Chainsaw films but nothing will come close to the original.Having watched this, I still don't know the answer. This version is incredibly bad: predictable wafer-thin plot, hammy acting, stereotypical characters, every horror cliché you can imagine, little or no tension it is so predictable and so focused on the gore it forgets to actually keep you in suspense.Nearest I can get to figuring out why this was made was to woke-ify the story for modern young audiences. Hey, heaps of gore and murder is fine but don't you dare show a Confederate flag!",2022-03-09
"I was interested when I heard there would be a direct sequel to the original film but this is barely watchable. The runtime of this film isn't even an hour and a half (barely 1hr14min before the credits start) and leatherface doesn't touch a saw until 50 min into the film. That's right you will be sitting there for FIFTY MINUTES before you see any chainsaws in this movie. I'm not sure who the target audience for this is meant to be but as a fan of the original this was a pain to watch, and being that its meant to be a direct sequel that confused me. I recommend you skip this if you love the original because it's nothing like it.",2022-02-19

"Having watched the trailer I was not holding out much hope for this film at all. The clip of the 'woke' ones on the bus with phones held like weapons in their hands threatening to 'cancel' Leatherface really says it all.This film was an absolute abomination. Seriously how could the film makers even dream of doing this? It is shameful to take the characters of Leatherface and Sally and make a complete mockery of them.If you just want to watch a movie for the gore factor, then go for it, you are served plenty of gore. But don't go into this film as a hardcore TCM fan or you will be wanting to scrub your eyes out with industrial disinfectant at the end.The fact that they turn Leatherface into a character that needs to occasionally take refuge from attack? And that they had the absolute hide to have Sally literally thrown onto a rubbish heap is atrocious.We won't even start questioning how old Leatherface would actually be... and how he was capable of making it around and waving a chainsaw at that age. Leatherface is after all human, he isn't Michael Myers.The whole bringing back the 'one who got away' might have worked slightly for the Halloween franchise, but it failed miserably for TCM.I doubt the writers of this film had any true passion for the original film. There was nothing even remotely atmospheric of the original, and quite frankly - Grandpa in the original film was more terrifying than this version of Leatherface.Learn to leave stuff alone.",2022-02-18

"What can I say. Netflix is just not good at producing things. It always looks like one of those cheap straight to DVD movies, you mistakenly thought would be good, back when VOD didn't exist. As far as this new entry of TCM is concerned, it has some interesting ideas, but the script and directing are weak. And all the characters, except the sisters, are disposable. Even leather face overstayed his welcome and should've been killed off, so we won't have this cringeworthy ending. I'm not even mentioning the way the Sally character was wasted, which is one of the many reasons this sequel should be written out of the franchise altogether.",2022-03-01
"Why was this ever thought of, let alone made? It's supposed to do away with part 2 & is set 48 years since the 1974 original film, but they completely messed up!! Leatherface would be in his 70's!!

If anything, it just encourages millennials to stay in their parents basement to avoid being slaughtered by a psycho with a chainsaw...",2022-02-18
"Texas Chainsaw Massacre is everything wrong with mainstream horror, a cheap, lazy, unoriginal, pointless and rushed horror film that's barely feature length with cheap nostalgia and a complete reliance on jump scares that are never effectively atmospheric or scary.The characters have next to no depth or emotional weight and are colossally stupid to the extent you don't care if they survive and is clearly done to pad out the run-time. The ending is laughably bad and lazy and just has to sequel bait.However, it's not without some positives, though they are few and far between. There's plenty of gore, some of which is impressive. It's mostly competently shot and some of the score by Colin Stetson is better than what is on screen.",2022-02-23

All the stupid stuff from the Tesla to the smart phones to the flag to the party on the bus was absolutely absurd.

Nothing new for a slasher, but it's very annoying.That said, it is very creepy and intriguing, and the cinematography is decent. I found myself hiding behind a pillow a lot, mostly because the kills were so brutal, but also because I was terrified at certain times.A good enough watch if you're a horror/TCM fan, but don't expect a great movie.

"More horror films/reboots need to learn from this. 74 minutes (without credits), wham bam thank you mam, no messing around, doesn't try to be clever, just gets the job done for the fans. The modern viewer doesn't want 2 hours of drawn out Texas Chainsaw taking itself way too seriously. The story doesn't make much sense and the acting is pretty lame. But this is what you want, or at least expect, from an old school slasher which follows the tried and tested formula. There were some fun kills and a few jumps. But basically it was a short and sweet, quickly paced, old school slasher film executed with even a bit of flair and style. The wheel has not been reinvented, but this was precisely what was required in 2022 for a low budget reboot of a classic. Maybe it could have done more, but I think what it achieved is not to be underestimated, when the vast majority of horror films that follow a dated formula like this flat and take themselves far too seriously and have no style or gumption.",2022-02-25
"Yikes. What a mess of ""social issue"" dujour would we have today you ask?Just an absolute travesty if you're a fan of the Tobe Hooper classic, and shows less is more when you compare the two, which you really shouldn't at all as it is.It's just littered with not-so-vague racial triggers and LBGT flags...which why would I have a problem in real-life world, but it just becomes a cheap ploy when it's forced and loses any level of credibility as a film specifically. It's not just this film, it's everything lately that caters to the woke, while pissing off people that like well done genre films, which this is not, heavy handed with the tactics or not.Beyond those issues, this film should've never left the barn, so to speak. It's a cheap sale to Netflix for the sensitive kiddies who eat this sort of thing up. Bad writing, and poor attempt at trying to capture the grittiness of the original.We've reached peak social issue triggers, or at least I have. The people that want this in their films, let alone horror films, are the above ground pool of film watchers. Directors that bow down to it are frauds...they have nothing of their own original thought process in telling their story on film.If you liked the latest Halloween cash grab, then you will love this.

"I wasn't exactly eagerly awaiting the Texas Chainsaw Massacre reboot but I was still interested in checking it out on Netflix over the weekend. Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a contender of being one of the worst movies of 2022. It's predictable, gory, lame rubbish with characters that you just don't care about and a forgettable plot.A group of idealistic woke hipsters including Melody (Sarah Yarkin), her troubled sister Lila (Elsie Fisher), and their self centered friend Dante (Jacob Latimore) and Dante's stuck up girlfriend Ruth (Nell Hudson) have come from the big city to Harlow, Texas (actually filmed in Bulgaria) to gentrify the dilapidated small town and bring it back to life for other like minded hipsters to live in. Gun loving mechanic Richter (Moe Dunford) who is one of the few locals in the town thinks they're all idiots though he does have a soft spot for Lila. When they arrive, they run into immediate conflict with Ginny (Alice Krige) who is one of the homeowners and insists that she's not leaving. After she suffers from a heart attack as she is forced from her home by the Sheriff (William Hope who played Lieutenant Gorman in Aliens) and his deputy (Jolyon Coy), her son Leatherface (Mark Burnham) resumes his bloodthirsty and murderous ways. While Leatherface makes his way back to Harlow, a bus full of halfwitted influencers and potential buyers visit the town to join in on the fun. To celebrate with the hipster quartet. Little do they know that they shouldn't have come to Harlow as Leatherface returns to dust off his chainsaw to satisfy his bloodlust.Melody and Lila find themselves running for their lives and to get out of the haunted town in one piece. The original survivor Sally Hardesty (Olwen Fouere, replacing Marilyn Burns who passed away in 2014) hears that Leatherface has resurfaced and goes into Sarah Connor/Laurie Strode mode and heads to Harlow to terminate the chainsaw wielding maniac and end his reign of terror for good.There's nothing more to say. The characters are all dumb and lack any kind of logic and common sense and the plot is predictable and wafer thin. The gory death scenes are turned up to 11 which is the only thing that kept me going. And why gentrify an abandoned town nobody cares about. It's just a safe space for all the pretentious, self centered hipsters to gather and carry on like they're in their own little bubble like they probably have most of their lives. They're so precious that they even feel threatened by a flag hanging from a building as well as the sight of firearms and the presence of law enforcement. The characters are all just nothing more than potential victims for Leatherface but the viewer knows that, right?Forget the other sequels and mediocre reboots and give me the original 1974 classic any day. At least that movie scared you out of your seat and Leatherface had the fear factor about him. The 2022 reboot was certainly nothing new, just another indifferent entry in the series.3/10.",2022-02-20

"A complete dumpster fire. Other than some real cool gore and at least it's a fast paced movie, this new Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie on Netflix is a epic fail. From bad acting & dialogue to annoying, beyond stereotypical characters along with horrible direction, lazy story and writing, meh cinematography, forgettable music, really weak social commentary in the addition to the obviously forced SJW politics which I'm honestly am getting tired of in movies now, and production values somehow looks & feels even cheaper than the previous two TCM movies made by Millennium Media.This makes Halloween Kills look like The Empire Strikes Back, it's that bad of a movie!Can the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series please rest in peace now? There's really nothing more you can do with the Leatherface lore at this point. P. S., I'm honestly am not a huge TCM fan with exception of part 2, the 2003 remake and its prequel The Beginning.

Although visually stunning and some amazing kills this film can't overcome its messy script and bad acting. The film attempts to recreate a similar plot to Halloween 2018 however it fails in every aspect focusing on its new characters and giving Sally little screen time. All the new characters where just unlikable and stupid I never cared when they died and in fact I wanted some of them to die at points.The film has themes and wants to show political commentary on guns, racism ect but the films position on those themes is never made clear. The films somehow anti and pro gun at the same time. You think the films gonna spread a message about the dangers of racism judging by the first 20 minutes but it drops it straight away. The film feels confused.It feels like the director wanted to shoot some really cool sequences and scenes but didn't care for the rest of it.",2022-02-18

"Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2022) is a movie my wife and I watched on Netflix last weekend. The storyline follows a group of kids looking to buy a ghost town in Texas as an investment property. As their investors pull into the ghost town the kids discover Leatherface from the original Texas Chainsaw Masscre has been hiding in their ghost town for 50 years.This movie is directed by David Blue Garcia (Tejano) and stars Sarah Yarkin (Happy Death Day 2U), Elsie Fisher (Castle Rock), Mark Burnham (Lowlife), Jacob Latimore (Detroit), Moe Dunford (Vikings) and Olwen Fouéré (Mandy).The storyline for this picture had a good opening and some potential. The cinematography aligned with what you expected from a Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie. Unfortunately about 15-20 minutes into the movie they threw the premise out and just went on an all out killing spree with virtually no rhyme or reason. Yes, they tried to have the lone survivor from the first film tie the movie together and make for a cool element (much like Halloween and the new Scream movie)...but it didn't work.There are some great kills in here and fantastic gore and blood splatter. They didn't skimp on special effects, but it felt like a movie that just wanted cool kills and essentially nothing else (the bus scene was ridiculous).Overall this movie falls flat and is a huge disappointment for fans of the franchise who was excited for a big budget movie that could have been done right. Unfortunately the writing was poor and the execution was worse. I would score this a 5/10 but still recommend seeing it once.",2022-02-26
"Holy Cow.This is JOINT FIRST PLACE FOR THE WORST TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE MOVIE. It's absolutely terrible, let's start of with the story. 3 young adults/one teen are involved in the gentrification of Harlow. Leatherface is a local unsolved mystery, because he was never caught in the first one. Sallys whereabouts are not known (for now). The group head to Harlow to begin proceedings and not long behind them investors are on their way travelling via bus to see their new town.Simple premise.. then it all turns to utter crap.Leatherface is living with his foster sick mom (?) in an old orphanage. Two of the teens wander into her home thinking it's abandoned and wanting to remove a confederate flag. The OG '74 house does not exist in this one.Then LF foster mom has a weird convo with the two teens, one gets the police, she feels sick and police take her away to get to the hospital. LF accompanies her in the van. She dies and then well he wears her face as a mask and starts killing. That's it. That's the entire arch of LF.BUT.. wait.. This is supposed to be a direct sequel to the OG 74' movie. Sally, who laughed euphorically at the end of the OG movie.. gets word via dispatcher that there's been a crash and someone's wearing a face. While a group of teens are trapped on a bus. (Sigh) they single handedly ruined sally story. Copied Halloween and Halloween Kills in that Sally can't let Leatheface go (similar to how Lori can't let Michael go), turns out he doesn't remember her, she wants to kill him... he kills her and throws her In trash. Yup. Not a single insight into her life, nothing to add on to her history. Then she's thrown into garbage.Let me just say the acting in this movie is borderline wooden. It sounds like a bunch of 40 year olds wrote the script in the imagination of them being a young adult in todays world. The mortgage woman In the movie acting is shocking. You've just seen a man with half his jaw ripped off die in front of you and you're Standing there wooden?! The actress literally smilies when pinned against the window scene in the bus if you rewatch it. Also, she doesn't tell the people on the bus what's happening someone's just died in front of you!!! Terrible writing and the way it was acted is just bad.Pros: Cinematography is decent, some nice shots. Methods of kill aren't too badCons: Weak script, 2D characters, stupid premise, directing was honestly silly, rubbish sally story. Honestly I could go on.The movie ends with a failed wannabe attempted a Friday 13th Jump scare. It fails.Just give this movie a hard pass. Stick to the OG movie and the 2003/2006 one if you like them. I don't think I'll ever watch this garbage movie again.",2022-02-19
"Contains spoilers!!!A bunch of rich, privileged, young people from the city buy up a rundown and seemingly abandoned town in Texas with the intention of gentrifying it. They wrongfully have an elderly sick lady forcibly removed from her home, and when she dies on the way to the hospital, her adult son goes on a killing spree. Unfortunately for all involved, that adult son happens to be the chainsaw wielding murderer 'Leatherface' from the brutal events that took place years earlier.This has some pretty gruesome and violent kill scenes including a bus full of millennials who live stream their own horrific deaths.I liked that the character Sally, who was the sole survivor of the original massacre, comes back for revenge as an ass kicking grandma with a grudge.The victims are a bunch of annoying privileged hipsters that were unlikeable from the start, so it was kind of enjoyable watching them get killed.I didn't have high hopes for this movie as some of the films in this franchise have been quite bad, but it was better than I expected. As a sequel to the original film, it was well made and had a believable storyline that didn't really ignore any major details from the original as so many sequels do.Definitely worth watching if you are a fan of the franchise or even just the original film.",2022-02-18
"Cinematography, locations, gore effects - all fine. Aspects of the story were good, like the idea of entrepreneurs buying a ghost town. It might've made a fair standalone movie. As a sequel to TCM it's less interesting, and less reasonable.Would wealthy influencers buying a ghost town to resell parts of it to other wealthy influencers be working on their own without a staff of their own, though? That's pretty doubtful.The film has them arriving last-minute before the auction, and meeting (for the first time!) a local mechanic who somehow single-handedly spruced up the facades of the town. Dumb.The survivor of the first movie, meanwhile, went into law enforcement and has spent the last fifty years looking for Leatherface. In all that time she never thought to check a ghost town in walking distance from the Sawyer family's farmhouse? Dumb. In fifty years has she worked on her marksmanship? No, she's a terrible shot at least half the time. Thought about what weapons would be most effective against Leatherface? No, she chooses a double-barreled shotgun over, say, a powerful handgun or a semi-automatic rifle despite the limited number of shots. Some kind of armor against chainsaws when chainsaw protective gear (helmet, visor, jacket, gloves, trousers, boots) is easy to come by these days? Nope. How about a partner, something her law enforcement would have impressed upon her the importance of having... again, no. She's been made into a Laurie Strode, except exceptionally stupid.How about Leatherface? Evidently he's been twiddling his thumbs for fifty years, putting on weight in a house he supposedly never leaves and always not killing everyone in sight. Somehow he's otherwise supremely physically fit. He's also hidden a chainsaw behind a wall, to retrieve when needed. Never mind that the homeowner would have noticed the considerable work involved in hiding it, or the fact that he could have left it out in the open in the large house with other tools, or amidst clutter, and nobody would have batted an eye at it because ordinary people do own chainsaws. Or, if he still felt he must hide it, hidden it in a more easily accessible spot like a basement crawlspace. Instead, it's treated like he's John Wick retrieving his basement stash from under concrete with a sledgehammer when he needs to come out of retirement.Aside from borrowing from Halloween and John Wick, there's a Shining scene, a Friday the 13th scene, and I'm sure others.The ending is exceptionally inane.",2022-03-13

"TCM 2022 delivers what's expected. It's full of gore and blood, and the movie checks that mark with creative killings and blood gushes. The characters also bland enough so that you don't feel sorry for their death, even though the plot really wants you to care for them.My question in this movie is why include Sally after all? I never think she's really essential in this franchise, and yet her post-original-movie life gives her a Laurie Strode-esque arc with almost no differences, making it almost seem lazy. She also didn't give any wisdom or inputs to the new characters about Leatherface, so why bother? Her scenes (continued with her stupid-dramatic choices) somehow don't add up the movie's running time to touch 90 minutes, yet it still feels too long and boring.I think 2022 TCM hides too much to begin with as a sequel with so many mysteries (which seem to be unrevealed in the next installment), hence they have nothing to show except the return of Sally and the gorefest. They need to give more teaser, backstory, or anything to persuade us that TCM is worth-watching.",2022-02-21

"Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a scam. It's hardly even a movie since its only concern is violence. There are some minimal attempts at hackneyed characters and plot, but those are incredibly shallow and swiftly abandoned. A vast majority of the film's short runtime is solely dedicated to repetitive Leatherface attacks. That might sound enticing, but it gets old fast. It's difficult to connect with hollow characters who make contrived decisions and get into an endless cycle of predicaments. Because the story is so thoroughly discarded, Massacre quickly devolves into numbing, structureless chaos. It's equivalent to YouTube clips of mindless action.Meanwhile, Texas Chainsaw Massacre is poorly made. There are moments of interesting visuals, proactive editing, and weighty sound, but those are few and far between. More often, those fronts are bland and disengaged. Similarly, the music contributes little to the experience because it is forgettably generic. Furthermore, Texas Chainsaw Massacre looks cheap because the setting is confined, the makeup is unconvincing, and the effects are weak. Plus, the cast is clearly inexperienced because nobody is charismatic, unique, or believable in their roles. Overall, Texas Chainsaw Massacre is an empty shell of a movie that offers almost nothing.Writing: 1/10

"I've got to be honest: when I say ""unbearable"", I mean it. We made it 20 minutes in before deciding to shut this monstrosity off (we debated duct-taping our eyes and ears shut forever as a protest, but deemed that a slight overreaction).I understand that not every movie has to be a masterpiece. I understand that not every character is going to gel with your taste. But it almost takes effort to create characters so unlikeable, so completely divorced from any type of real person. It's like these writers have never met anyone. Add to this a premise which is so shockingly dumb, I couldn't believe what I was watching, as well as plot contrivances and holes so massive, you can't believe what you see unfold.So, a couple of unsuccessful influencers (I say ""unsuccessful"" because your 2000 likes on instagram aren't going to net you the cash to buy your Tesla) decide to appropriate a ghost town (which for some reason still has an active police force) to turn into influencer heaven. ""We can open a comic book store there!"" one character says, pointing at a storefront in an uninhabited town in the middle of the desert 7 hours away from civilization. Who WRITES this? Anyway, our main character, a curly-haired punchable face who apparently has never interacted with humans, does her best to piss everyone off for no reason, including telling an old woman in her own house to get lost because they bought the house. Who's the villain in this story? And Dante, who goes crazy about a hanging confederate flag (rightly so), then... leaves it on the ground when it's taken down? You know people can still see it when it's on the ground, right?I have no idea what happens after that because once the blonde decides to go with the evicted old lady for literally no reason, we unplugged our tv and took a vow of silence.

"Doing away with the countless sequels, prequels and reimagining's that have cropped up in the franchise brand since Tobe Hooper's original horror entry revved into the history books way back in 1974, Netflix's Texas Chainsaw Massacre (full props for the original naming) sees sophomore director David Blue Garcia deliver a blood soaked gore-fest under the guidance of Evil Dead/Don't Breathe creative team Fede Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues, resulting in an end product that may receive top marks for inventive and often horrific carnage but extensive fail marks in almost all other departments.Clocking in at a brisk sub-90 minute runtime, a refreshing component in a genre that has over recent time begun to overstay its welcome with long in the tooth running times, TCM wastes little time or effort doing much of note outside of creating ways and developing scenarios where Mark Burnham's mask clad Leatherface gets to go about his grisly business dispatching a bunch of utterly unlikeable and charisma free characters, characters that inhabit a story that is devoid of saving, conjured up by a script that should make it very hard for screenwriter Chris Thomas Devlin too get future work in Hollywood.It's within these components that we find it difficult to properly nail down just how bad or even so bad its good TCM actually is, for while it fails in many key aspects we would usually associate with being integral to making a good feature film, there's been far worse and less tolerable genre entries over the recent years and there's little denying that despite the lack of narrative goodness, scares/frights or noteworthy acting turns, Garcia's blood-soaked affair might be just the type of mindless and murderous flick some viewers are wanting.With promises from Garcia as well as Alvarex and Sayagues in the lead up to Netflix dropping their film that their bloody affair would deal directly with the events of Hooper's original and even bring back past characters, with the character of Sally Hardesty returning this round in a move that feels directly ripped from the minds behind Halloween's 2018 revival, long-term fans of the genre defining original are going to likely walk away from this TCM effort disappointed that this ride didn't do more with its potential to deal with almost 50 years worth of time in between misused tools being unleashed, even if towards the films latter stages it appears likely that some connecting of the dots were thought about.There's no question about TCM's merits as a good film, as it's not, but as a film that it is and with enough creative chainsaw inflicted chaos that it harbors (a bus set sequence is a real eye popping spectacle), there's a significant amount of dumb horror infested entertainment here to make this latest franchise entry far from the worst of its brand.Final Say -Totally unnecessary and let down by an inability to make a single likable character out of its dire script, Texas Chainsaw Massacre is another poor addition to a once classic brand but does enough on the bloodthirsty front to at least do something right.2 sets of keys out of 5For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",2022-02-24

To treat it as a franchise is so utterly hopeless. Even Tobe Hooper knew that when he made Texas Chainsaw Massacre II, which is the only good sequel because it's not taking itself seriously and is more about having a good time and laughs...

Or maybe she is too old, so she suddenly forgets who she is and wonders why a strange looking freak is standing right in front of her?

The storyline made no sense, the characters were mostly disposable, so why should I care if they get killed off? The reason why Leatherface turns up and starts murdering again also makes no sense.

"44/100Texas Chainsaw Massacre fails at virtually everything. Every aspect that I expected this movie would deliver happened exactly as one would think. At this point, it's no surprise to say that the film only exists as the one that snucked in at the slasher comeback party.I guess it's not surprising to say that the question we all have to ask ourselves when we see this is... Why? The plot merely exists to get to the action as quickly as possible while trying to have minimal coherence, making its social commentary feel superficial. They are a complete mockery of people with the ideologies that the film portrays. That's why the plot, precisely what matters most, especially in a slasher, takes the backseat in record time.In the end, we all recognize that, from this film, there is no turning back. The people behind it will not find coherent ways to continue the story, but the ones that provide the most money.

But all the main street lights still work and the theatre marque, etc. That set aside...the casting was TERRIBLE. I didn't care about any of them except the Richter guy and the two cops. Everyone else was just terribly miscast.Wasn't that original as it was a mash up of Halloween movies and The House of Wax premise.Only props goes to the amount of gore. And since we were rooting for the entire cast to die anyways...and least that was done well.",2022-02-21
"Even considering it's a slasher movie, the amount of stupid decisions is staggering.The plot is pretty dull.The acting is average at best.The characters are all absolute morons to a degree that makes the movie almost unwatchable.Also, even for a movie - there's a limit to how many times you can shoot, cut, and stab a guy and still have him running around.Do yourself a favour: Don't watch it.I have a pretty high tolerance for bad horror movies but this is one is not worth anyone's time... not even when you're hungover and just wanna watch something stupid.",2022-02-19
"Being a true lover of almost all things Horror, this ""new take"" or sequel is just WRONG. I am aware that we live in 2022, but that does not mean everything needs to be wokey tokey stupefied.I will not go into any details, because I am cruel enough to wish you potential review readers suffer through the same wasted amount of time I did. Lolz. And yes I love this movie, because it is soooooo extremely bad, I will even watch it again.Not a single action in the whole movie makes sense. Aside from that, it's a complete letdown in the body count, kill factor, gore department, scare meter and any other relevant Horror film criterium. It really is just bad.I had hoped and wished for a revival of this once splendid shocker, but it's a tame attempt to bore you to death.",2022-02-18
"I honestly don't think I have ever seen a dumber movie! 🤣I've just watched it on a hangover and having read the reviews, basically wanted to see a bit of gore and if it was really a stupid as people were saying. I got the gore, but man, it's a comedy, surely?It has all your usually woke themes, but surprisingly I didn't find it lecturing, plus they mainly get massacred, which was nice.It's odd, because I wouldn't even say I'd wasted my time watching it, it was so bad it was entertaining!",2022-02-20
"So, this didn't get a cinema release? Are we seeing the death of cinema as we know it with all these streaming services today? 2022's Texas Chainsaw Massacre is so cheap it has devalued the legacy of '74's Chainsaw at the click of a finger and sold history short. (Just like all the others. They're sabotaging history for some reason?) This movie is like microwavable food - it's cheap and cooks fast and after you've consumed it you swear not to buy it ever again. Disposable rubbish. 2022's Chainsaw tells the ""already"" told story of a handful of out-of-towners who go meddling where they're not welcome and you know how the formula goes - same plot, same make-up and same outcome. It follows a beaten path already trodden before it.Billie Elish, and three other slack jawed city slickers, arrive at the back-roads of Lodi, Texas, cruising on auto-pilot in some Elon Musk battery charged guzzler. (Save the planet.) Yer, I bet 'ol Leathy's chainsaw runs on a lithium battery, too?So either Tex, or that weirdo from Breakdown, torment them on the road then the local sheriff's weigh in on the intimidation welcome as well. Man, this town of Lodi, I mean Harlow, looks like where the Silver Shamrock factory was located in Santa Mira. That or Tombstone?Laurie Strode shows up clutching an oxygen mask forgetting what movie she's in. Some racial tension flares over a flag. Tyler Mane shows up unmasked, like Kizz, and breaks someone's arm like Steven Seagal in his attempt to escape as he's being transferred to another mental asylum. Luke Perry makes an appearance as our lead. Billie Elish reveals that she's a survivor of a school massacre. (Didn't take Hollywood long to intertwine real life tragedies into their story lines.) This Rob Zombie Myer's character must be Leather Farce? He cuts Strode's face off, places it over his own dial and using movie magic it sticks like glue without any strapping. Didn't it cross Blondie's mind here to reach over and grab the sheriff's gun instead of radioing for help? The mask used for this 2022 offering looks like something Corey Taylor would wear. So, now Sally Hardesty is a Laurie Strode revenge-seeking wannabe who still holds a grudge from the past? (Wasn't that Dennis Hopper's role in part 2 seeking retribution for murdered family members?) Who is this busload of interlopers and why are they having a party in the middle of a ghost town for? And how was this entire town miraculously inherited by these 4 out of towners? If they're moving here where's all their luggage?Some murder victim shows up looking like Alex Winter from Freaked fake prosthetic and all. (The walking dead.) Luke Perry literally turns into Hammerhead, and no, I'm not talking about the Star Wars variety.This has zero atmosphere and no memorable score to speak of. Part of the reason the original Chainsaw was so great was because of the cheap creepy sound effects they used. (Cast your mind back to '74's part when Jim Siedow is driving Sally back to the farm house and that evil music plays up the driveway.) Chainsaw Face jumps on a bus without paying and is live streamed slaughtering unsuspecting twits as other ninny hammer's leave comments at the live broadcast. (This part was okay.) Did these clowns not think to jump the Sandman in numbers and disarm him on the bus? If you've got a chainsaw in someone's belly, mid-murder, wouldn't that give others 10 seconds to act?The splenetic Strode character shows up wearing a sheriff's badge and wielding a shotgun to save the day. You know, for a 70-year-old man Leather Farce moves pretty quickly for an old guy. Did they just rip-off Terminator 2's ending with the shotgun? Wow, a 300-pound man gets taken down by two bantamweights. Look at the girl power on display here! Who wrote this - Kathleen Kennedy?Today's modern movies leave you empty and numb. 2022's Chainsaw no exception. They're disposable two-minute microwave meals you discard easily and are forgotten overnight. Back in the 80's we used to talk about Chainsaw; Jason, Halloween and Evil Dead for years and years. They were memorable. But take a movie like Revenge of the Sith or Texas Chainsaw 3D and I couldn't tell you one memorable thing about either of those movies.When you break it down this movie roughly finishes at the 1 hour, 14-minute mark with about 10 minutes of credits. Bit short on content, aren't we? (Just like the Book of Boba Fett series. In fact, the 4 main actors in Chainsaw show the same lousy enthusiasm as the speeder bike riders in episode 3 of Book of Boba Fett. They're cut from the same cloth.)
""Oh my God, what is that? A jelly doughnut?"" Nah, but either way OMG - 2022's Chainsaw was filmed in Bulgaria! Where's that - in The Maldives?The Lone Star state has now miraculously relocated to Bulgaria. Due to either climate change or a mega seismic shift in Earth's geological ever-changing structure TX now resides in Bulgaria, Europe apparently. The Houston Euro's and the Bulgarian Cowboys are truly international teams now, man.Oh yer, and one more question. Why are women in entertainment today trying to prove how hard and tough they are? What happened to Grace Kelly or Rita Hayworth feminine class and style? No one wants women built like Gina Carano all beefed up and belting men around the ballpark. That's not ladylike.2022's Chainsaw gets an F. Unwarranted and an unnecessary movie in 2022.",2022-02-22
"My main issue with this movie is the fact that Leatherface re-emerges after 50 years. Let's say he was 20 during the first movie. That would make him 70 here. Am I supposed to believe that a 70 year old man is this muscular and fast and can somehow dolphin dive up out of the water? I don't think so. Also, how is it that the sheriff lived through being stabbed in the torso with a chainsaw running through her? With a $20,000,000 budget, I'm quite disappointed.",2022-03-01

"Netflix Texas chainsaw massacre takes place 50 years after the events of the original. A group of social influencers travels to an abandoned remote town of Harlow, where they plan to auction off the properties to create a trendy ""safe space"" for people. Turns out Leatherface has been hiding there all this time, and after a tragic loss get back to the business of hacking up limbs and bashing in skulls. In what's now the third film to call itself the direct sequel to the original. This film is a butchered-up corpse with a plot so half-ass with only the death being the only thing to take away from this movie. If you just wanna see some people get hacked up you'll get that at least. Death in these kinds of films is always wanted, but the same tired format goes on. If you just make a bunch of Unlikeable characters we're not gonna care to be invested in what they're saying or doing or when they die. These characters are all trash from the sisters' annoying bickering to the typical social commentary attitudes. With reactions to confederate flags and references to school shootings. These people are as one dimension as they come. In want leads up to Leatherface killing again that outright have an old woman thrown out of her house in this town like these are who we're supposed to root and care about. If anything Leatherface is in the right for once to kill these people. The kills are the highlight of the film and when he's just slaughtering all these people on this bus it's great, but at the same time, Leatherface isn't Michael Myers or Jason. The strength he has and some of the damage he receives are really unlikely. Need we forget the fact that this is what a 60-70 year-old man at this point. When it comes to the character of Sally Hardesty this character is pointless. In what is flat out a ripoff of Laurie Strode from Halloween(2018) this old gruff old woman seeks revenge against the killer. Sally is barely in this movie and when she's on-screen doesn't say anything all that interesting or important. Just generic lines like I'm been waiting 50 years for this. And making stupid decisions that she should know better. You know nothing about her as to what she been doing all these years or what going through her head. All she does is just look at a picture of the original cast and that's it. This really is a disaster it's not as over the top as as say 2-4 and has none of the grit that the 2003 remake payed tribute to. It slightly better then Texas chainsaw 3d that that primary because of leatherface.",2022-02-19
"This was by far the worst out of the series.

"Well, this was not the movie for me. I love the franchise; the original and the 2003 and 2006 entries my favorite (especially 2003), but this one? No. I knew from the beginning when I saw that kinky haired girl that I was not in for a good time. I believe the summary said influencers, and I thought ""oh god millennial crap movie."" And I was not wrong. I know it's not exactly gentrification, as barely anyone lived there, but it was close enough. Young people dressed like hipsters going to a poor town so they can buy it up with their parents money and make it overpriced bs no one asked for. I'm 25 minutes in and I don't like a single character outside of maybe the contractor. I'll watch the rest but it'll be on in the background.And I was right. Total trash. Terrible deaths.

"This was my first Texas Chainsaw Massacre film... perhaps that was my mistake. I genuinely disliked this movie, so much was squandered. The cast was unlikeable, the scares weren't really scares, and I was positive the movie was going to be over a hundred times.

"...a hundred times, even if you've ""never seen"" it.It's exactly the same film, as all the other slasher films - one look at the cast and you know exactly what's going to happen, even in what order.Random blonde girl, check, random black guy, check, some independent/self confident and totally out of touch woman, check. Plus less than a plain Jane, check.For 50 years the sheriff woman was trying to find Leatherface, but couldn't - because he was ""wearing a mask"" back then...yeah, in an area with like 5 people.So how old is he supposed to be now? 70? 80? Or was he like 5 years old 50 years ago, because the actor, although you couldn't really see, obviously wasn't all that old.So anyway, he was just chillin' at home, with his ma, for 50 years, minding his own business, until this group of dumb out of touch city people came over with their brilliant idea.Well, I can actually kind of see something like that happening, even if the perpetrator wasn't Leatherface. Rude, self centred, out of touch city people have invaded our coast town as well. No lady, we don't have a coffee shop on every beach....where's my chainsaw?Anyway, I have two chainsaws, one petrol, one with a battery, his was obviously much-much better, in perfect working condition, ready to go, after 50 years of just sitting. Well, it's true that they made better lasting products decades ago. 50 year old oil, 50 year old petrol, didn't even need to adjust the chain.Are they just making these films, so that people have something to do? I mean the actors, the crew, people who build the sets, rent cars, equipment.. because there is no other purpose. It's not good, it's a waste of time - one positive note, it's not a long film! That's good. And another positive note, the clueless city people/bus people, were depicted quite accurately. So I'll raise my rating from 2 to 3 because of these two things.",2023-04-02

So a bunch of influencer kids go to to Harlow in Texas to gentrify the place so that people can have a new fresh start.........whatever!! The point is leatherface ain't that happy with new intruders and wants to kill them.The film has none of the grittiness, violence and darkness of the original and can't even churn out anything new by itself, bringing back the original surviving woman only to kill her off as unceremoniously as possible. The new kids are annoying and behave as stupidly as possible but the film expects us to care for them by giving them a half baked backstory which I can't even remember.Some of them die sooner than the others but the killings have no real style or tension. Its a big slugfest......except a few cool shots and one great murder at the end its another leagacy-quel that should have been abandoned back at the barn!!!!",2022-02-27

A good amount of blood and casualties. But that's all it got. A horrendous story with cringe attempts at character development and acting.

Leatherface was hit with a shotgun round and has gone ina building, I know, I'll go after him instead of running in the opposite direction.How do these films still get made, and why the constant reboots of the Texas Chainsaw films?

"Whatever happened to numbering sequels? Better yet, whatever happened to ensuring structure and continuity, or showing a minimum of respect to the previous installments in a franchise; regardless of how bad they were? I have lost count, that's what happens without numbering, but this must be the 9th or 10th entry in the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" series already, and it's yet another one with the exact same title as the 1974-original, and yet another one that completely disregards all the other movies in between. These sequels keep presenting themselves as direct sequels to the Tobe Hooper's original landmark. Is it a legal issue, I wonder, or do all these new movies hate the rest of the series so badly that they pretend they don't exist?The omens for this 2022 version weren't very promising, to say the least. Spit at during test-screenings, low ratings, negative reviews, and a whole lot of diehard TCM fanatics claiming it's another worthless entry in an already troubled franchise.The scenario is hopeless, for sure. We're meant to believe that Leatherface hid himself for 48 years in mum's orphanage after the original massacre, without indulging in new murders? Yeah right, as if you can keep a natural born killer like that calm and locked up for so long. Even more absurd, we're also meant to accept that Sally Hardesty, sole survivor of the original, has been living in the same region as Leatherface for almost half a century without knowing it, and that she grew from a shy and vulnerable victim into a tough vigilante with only vengeance on her mind. Please, don't push my suspension of disbelief too far.On a slightly more positive note, the ""main"" plot is rather okay. A van full of hipsters are on their way to Harlow; - a Texan ghost town they bought entirely to start a community away from stress and hectic big-city life. They arrive to make necessary preparations, as a bus full of potential investors are coming over to visit, but little do they know that Harlow isn't completely abandoned just yet...The newest ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is most effective when simply seen as a straightforward and unpretentious slasher. It is undoubtedly the goriest of the series, making even ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" (2013) nd ""Leatherface"" (2017) look like Disney movies. Even before the dusts off his beloved chainsaw, Leatherface already committed half a dozen of vile and nasty murders with a variety of other tools, like hammers, meat cleavers, pieces of glass, and even a poor guy's own broken bones. Those are all just appetizers, mind you, as the highlight of the film is a gloriously sadistic bloodbath inside the tour bus. The rest may be worthless, but the gore is pure entertainment.

Either way, it works good in the way, you don't care about the main characters at all.Funnily enough I like the whole buildup around the old woman taking care of the old orphanage, I wish they had kept the tension around that a little bit longer, before letting the cat out of the bag.

So, the director made the main characters very modern by creating that 'influencer', self absorbed type for all of them. I understand why he did this as it's to modernise the movie, but it created 4 of the most annoying characters going. I wasn't going to be fussed if any died or not. The characters were given no back stories or anything either, kind of just threw us into it. All just backs up the point that you're not really rooting for anyone here!So the plot. I'll be honest it wasn't written the best, however there's much worse out there. The final half an hour was the worst to be honest. Really filled with cliche's, the ""I'm going to fall over when being chased"" and the ""instead of just killing you I will tell you why I'm not keen on you, before failing to kill you because I took too long"" are used to full effect. And just overall there's a lot of plot holes leading to the end, felt a little rushed also in all honesty.The ending was just a bit daft as well, just no need for it and felt like a final shot at jump scaring by the director more than anything else. Won't say anything else, don't want to spoil.But hey ho, are you really here for an in-depth plot. Guarantee most just want to see a guy go a bit insane with a chainsaw and that's why for me it's a 5/10 average score.The gore is there to full effect, they really don't hold back there. Leatherface maintained that level of anonymity whilst also being a good on screen killer and for me the modernised characters will be really good and relatable for some, just not me.So yeah it's a 5/10 from me today. Don't rush to watch, but if you want a nice, quick and easy gore/slasher film then give it a go.",2022-02-19
"This is beyond idiotic! Ridiculous and annoying 🙄 deserve less than a star. This is the worst movie have ever seen in years! Don't waist your time watching this film, top 10 on Netflix? It's a -10 to me.",2022-02-19
"Don't know what that was. Supposed heroine gets a chainsaw ripped through her heart and gut and she is able to shoot Leatherface from 200 ft away? Man's face sliced in half and he is able to walk down the block?This was bad effects, bad acting, and bad plot. Shameful addition to a classic horror series.",2022-02-19
Leather face is a senior citizen with super powers and a perpetually powered chain saw - movie is laughable - not much of a horror but if you enjoy watching an overweight approx 70 ish dude who is one steak away from a heart attack chase and slaughter a group of hipsters around an abandoned town then this is the flick for you.,2022-02-18
"It was 1:20 long yet felt like about 4 hours. Awful story, awful character development, terribly predictable. Can't believe anyone signed off on this.Without doubt the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen some bad movies.You won't care who lives and who dies.",2022-02-18
I love the franchise. This makes the 2005 House of wax look like a masterpiece which it really reminded me of but for the wrong reasons. This isn't leatherface but it looks like a rip-off. The character is totally missing here. This really looks like a asylum rip-off. Who ever gave this over 5 stars must hate Leatherface.,2022-02-18
A movie that I found exactly what I was hoping for.What I don't understand is; Why were people waiting for a masterpiece? Such a thing was never promised.How good were the others except the first movie in this series?,2022-02-18
"Good points:
+A lot of gore;
+Very good soundtrack;
+It's bad, but can entertain;Bad Points:
-The plot is basic and awful, full of plot holes and stupid scenes.-It made me miss the insanity of the Sawyer family, one of the main elements that made the old movie being unforgettable;
-Almost all of the characters are despicable, making it difficult to empathize with them;
-This new version of Leatherface and his mask are one of the worst in the entire saga;
-A disrespect for the franchise and its legacy
-The cinematography is extremely dark!",2022-02-18
"As a horror fan, and a fan of the franchise, I can't express how disappointed I was with this. The only think in this that even ties it to the franchise is the existence of Leatherface and Sally. Btw, Leatherface has aged much better than Sally after 50 years. Super weak story line, and no family, no nothing. The 3 stars was for the somewhat creative kills, and decent fx. This was easily the worst in the franchise, right next to Part 2.",2022-02-22
"I honestly did not anticipate just how bad this movie could be. I figured it would be a paint by numbers cheesy slasher flick at the very least, but to call it that would be an insult to cheesy slasher flicks.This film is awful. The acting is terrible, the script is painstakingly bad and the story nonsensical. How could they get this so wrong? It doesn't matter how low your expectations are going in to this because you will still be left disappointed.It gets 2 stars instead of zero because at least they didn't skimp out on the gore.One of the worst films I've ever seen.",2022-02-20
"This is a legacy film as they have become popular (Halloween, Scream, Star Wars). A group of young outsiders plan to auction off much of the town of Harlow Texas in hopes of build back better. It is nearly a ghost town. A mishap causes an old lady to die, connected to Leatherface, now played by Mark Burnham. The sole survivor of the massacre Sally Hardesty (Olwen Fouéré) has been looking for Leatherface for decades. Now he has showed up and is cutting up the town with a decades old chainsaw that never skips or runs out of gas.This was perhaps the worst legacy film that I recall. It ties-in, but is poorly scripted. Clearly the length of time between the films (1973 original) makes using anyone from the original cast being spry is questionable.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",2022-03-03
"Your typical run of the mill woke 2010s/2020s slasher. CGI-check, Short run time-check, zero character development-check, cheap jumpscares-check, all female heroes-check.The original film was lightning in a bottle, always difficult to come close to achieving the same impact but the TCM franchise is arguably the weakest of the big horror franchises. Aside from TCM2 Its sequels are all different varieties of poor.I know Leatherface is the poster boy but the Sawyer family are what makes the original 2 movies work, with Leatherface being the blunt tool they use to carry out their' lifestyle'. There is no family in this movie and the character of leatherface suffers for it, just running around on his lonesome, hammering and sawing with abandon.Clearly heavily borrowing from the Halloween reboot/reset.The sets and setting are fine, actors uninspiring but not terrible, the gore level high, some practical effects but as is the sad standard today, mostly CGI. None of the characters have any development, a weak story to get the characters to the location and an even weaker story as to their background. They do hint at certain things but nothing is developed which is unsuprising in a film that (removing the credits) runs at about 74 minutes. Chuck another 10-15 minutes of character building in there and it might be a different film (though I doubt it).One day we'll get a decent TCM sequel but this aint it.",2022-02-19
"I love Texas Chainsaw, and was excited for a new adaptation. But oh my how bad this started; the story, the characters, the acting, the plot holes just awful, and all before the first 10 minutes. Shut if off almost immediately. Watch it, see how far you get lol.",2022-04-09
They keep repeating the same story with new characters and different setup. The guy keeps killing with chainsaw and nobody can even shoot properly at the killer. The killings are more of Comical than horror. Everyone is getting killed just like CJ does with chainsaw in San Andreas game. The killer gets so many bullets but still survives.,2022-02-26
The characters were so unlikeable I was happy when Leatherface killed them. I don't think the writer or director understand what constitutes tension or terror. This is one movie franchise where nothing beats the original.,2022-04-14
I love chainsaw movies! Even the dumb one with Matthew McConaughey was better then this one. Just there was nothing there. No story and nothing really on the history of leather face. I had no idea how he even got there. Now we will need a prequel just to clean up this mess.,2022-02-21
"Every single ""original"" horror movie the company has made has done nothing but rip pieces from iconic horror movies. This one is no different. Between the ""angry truck driver"" (jeepers creepers) to the moment leather face comes out of the water (jason Voorhees) this movie is just a mix of bad acting, zero continuity, terrible character development. Characters get skewered (butcher knife to the main neck artery bleed profusely then wake up ten minutes later to walk outside) woman gets sawed in the entire midsection yet can still breathe and shoot a gun with near perfect aim. Overall premise was terrible and none of it was worth the 80 minutes. Netflix just STOP!",2022-02-28
"Just skip it watch something else... I'm not sure if it's a bad attempt at a reboot or a poor attempt at a continuation. Writing is bad ....casting is bad... acting is almost ok... a bad combination of several movie ideas... Heroine is older gun toting ""crazy"" lady .... bent on revenge... killer shot and stabbed multiple times... Leatherface was just a psycopath ..now he is supernatural killer....

"It's always hard to make a better flick then the original one and be honest, the original one is a classic.Then came the franchise getting awry and terrible. Then came the reboots, they were okay and the next and the next and now Netflix decided to make a new TCM.Was it all that bad, no 'cause it's really gory and nasty. The thing I got a problem with is the slaying on the bus. That was exaggerated. About the characters, yes I agree they are a mixed bunch of weirdo's but after all i did like it.Why you ask, it clocks in under 90 minutes and that makes this flick over just before you know it.Just after the rather good Scream reboot came this one. It's not that bad as most of the people do say. I enjoyed it, just looked throughout the main lead and yes, it's full of clichés and yes you have seen it all before but I did like it.Gore 3/5

"Out of all these different horror movie franchises ""Texas chainsaw massacre"" is the one they never know what to do with, and you always end up wondering whether you should just rewatch the original, or the decent Jessica Beil remake.This time we're egnoring all the movies apart from the original again. Which I'm not sure works. Is this supose to be the same guy? Is he supose to be in his 70's?Either way there's plenty of gruesome action and some that we've definitely not seen before. We avoid jump scares. But the heroes still don't finish the killer off when they get the chance a bunch of times. It's unintentionally hilarious so enjoyable rubbish if not much else.",2022-02-18
"Ok, we have had a couple really bad entries in the Leatherface franchise, but this one is just bottom of the barrel horror. Once again, nobody can seem to write a good script. The main characters are so unlikable that I found myself rooting for them all to die only 10 minutes into the film. If you don't have characters for the audience to root for then you don't have a movie. Also, the film is very gross for the sake of being gross and I'm not into that. Just a really bad movie from beginning to end.",2022-03-13
"I was looking forward to a new tcm movie but was just generally disappointed with the overall movie , I now understand why it was sold to Netflix , just another bring back old characters to then kill off even scream did it. Just getting worse at this point imagine coming back to kill someone who nearly killed you to just for him to ignore you and walk past just made me actually shout at the tv, only redeeming was the kills and maybe the ending if it wasn't just a copy of the original which is just laughable.",2022-02-19
"It would take a college semester to inform those who aren't leatherface super fans how we've gotten to 2022s Texas chainsaw massacre David Blue Garcia's entry the 9th one in the southern slaughterhouse franchise besides everything but Toby Hooper's 1974 original...soooo forget about Matthew McConaughey's maniac and Alexandra daddario tripping over that comically short fence. It's a cocky move as Texas chainsaw massacre positions itself as a clean restart for a franchise with legendary whips. This messy as ever slasher isn't even better than some of the sequels it dares to erase. This will be remembered for its highlight reel of show stopping mutilation. Leatherface hammers shin bones into right angles, carves through influencers while live streams broadcast and punishes new age gentrifiers who hide behind moral creeds to take over impoverished towns. Leatherface comes off as a boomer who fights back with ill-conceived notes of sympathy but as far as kills are considered the movie titled massacre holds its promise. A single bus sequence with casualties galore could stand as the years most exquisitely vile display of slasher fatalities with all respects paid towards Garcia's special effects teams. It's Chris Thomas Devlin's screenplay that leaves heaps to be desired. It's terrible. The characters including sisters Melody and Lila. The school shooting survivor demand no investment nor do their journeys. Lila's haunting bullet scar sparks conversations around gun violence early only to meet the most ignorant flip of messaging later, even worse is the reintroduction of the original final girl Sally hardesty as a Lori strode
who's hell bent on killing Leatherface which couldn't be more mishandled. Both subplots feel shoehorned with advancements on the fly. Production design recalls better Texas chainsaw movies as cinematographer Ricardo Diaz captures the blistery sweltering lone Star heat on screen Hunter killer terror unfolds under Sunshine strong enough to toast sunflower fields while the abandoned town of Harlow feels claustrophobic amd isolated these sweaty visual callbacks to the original endure while other elements feel like a middle finger to the franchise's legacy. Leatherface is a vastly more interesting character when he's following orders from bloodlines psychopaths. NOT operating as just another masked brute Mark Burnham's performance as leather face requires mainly physical and position less vocal in the slashers later years he can still flail the chainsaw in circular mayhem but there's nothing to leather face outside his linebacker sprints and heavy plotting feet as Melody and Lila Sarah yarkin and Elsie Fisher don't show appropriate fear when staring down a lumbering horror icon. Sadly their characters aren't written past traceable outlines. They are incredibly unlikeable. It's a shame because splatterhouse goodness this extreme feels wasted by an experience that is too focused on making audiences feel violated and miserable. You can do that and still tell a terrifically macabre tale which this fails to do. My time was wasted waiting for this film to redefine leatherface's legacy better than the sequels and remakes it leaves in the rear view mirror. Those who only value slashers based on the body count and murderous creativity might give this pure guts no substance slasher a pass otherwise 2003's Texas chainsaw massacre does dark and gray better. This movie stinks like a basement full of corpses as Leatherface becomes just another Hulk villain. This is not exactly the fresh that the franchise die hards might have otherwise welcomed. This is one of the worst movies I've seen in recent years.",2022-02-19
"Simple storyline with no credible twist. Just blood and gore galore.Leatherface simply overpowers all of them, Richter included. If I were Sally Hardesty, I would have dispensed with the dialogue and would have done the opposite. The ending isn't believable after what happened the night before.Actingwise, the young actors are all right except that they are made to act dumb.",2022-02-25
"What a horrible movie. But, I do admit rooting for leather face. The extra characters, hipster wanna-be's, getting slaughtered in the bus was outstanding.Other then that, stupid movie, horrible acting, weak plot...I'm not even half way through and feel they should have just given up in the middle of the movie and said ""screw it, this is stupid!""",2022-04-18
"The ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" franchise is unique in that it, arguably, has only one good film in its series - that being the original 1974 film. A classic in its own right, ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" demonstrated to audiences that blood and gore isn't needed to instill fear. Foregoing this idea in the later films, the series was rebooted in 2003 with a remake that I genuinely enjoy; with more blood and gore, but no less frights, I felt like the film did an adequate job of revitalizing the franchise - but, judging but the communal IMDb score, most do not agree. In 2005, ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning,"" was released, serving as a prequel to the series. And while it delivers on all of the chainsaw action anyone could ever want, I found the movie to be exceedingly grotesque and nihilistic, with its violence a little too sadistic for my taste. Let's not even talk about ""Texas Chainsaw 3D,"" and let's move on to the 2017 prequel ""Leatherface;"" with its story-driven horror, I once again found myself a fan of this franchise. Enter ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" 2022.Oh boy. Well, at least it's only 80 minutes, am I right? Okay, I'm getting ahead of myself, because really, this film isn't all bad - it's just that a large majority of it is. But let's begin with the positives, and then explain some negatives. ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" looks good from a visual perspective; there's some actual competence behind the camera here, and they didn't skimp out when it comes to the cinematography. The issue here is that, with such a striking looking film, you'd at least expect some interesting looking murders. Alas, you do not get that. ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" has some incredibly lame, tame, and cheap looking kills - the exact opposite of what I want from a film about a chainsaw wielding serial killer. Yes, there is blood and gore, but it looks cheap and unconvincing, which is disappointing when it's clear that genuine care was taken with some of the visuals.The incredible Elsie Fisher stars - you may recognize her from ""Eighth Grade,"" which was no doubt one of the best movies of 2018. Here she gives a fine performance, one that is enhanced by adding an interesting backstory to her character, Lila. A school shooting survivor, Lila carries that trauma with her, both emotionally as well as physically, with a visible scar near her chest. It's a unique dynamic, one that is barely explored and virtually forgotten about as soon as it is introduced. You see a flashback here and there, but this backstory does little to enhance the story except for maybe add some tension when Lila finally picks up a gun(?). And if that's the case, what message are the filmmakers even going for? It's an interesting touch that's made confusing by the lack of utilization.Let's talk plot: Following a group of idealistic young friends who plan on converting a seemingly abandoned town into a liberal utopia, the film introduces a bunch of new characters while also bringing back Sally, the girl who survives the original massacre. Sally, originally played by Marilyn Burns and now portrayed by Olwen Fouéré, is out on a journey of revenge, wanting to enact vengeance on Leatherface for the slaying of her friends (""Halloween"" 2018, anybody?). And with these two separate plot elements introduced, as you can imagine, none of them get enough time to breathe. On one hand you have the group of uninteresting young adults (not including Lila, who is legitimately relatable and interesting) who you desperately want to see massacred due to the nonexistent character development (and of course, the movie does not deliver when it comes to kills). On the other hand, you have Sally who is seemingly on a warpath headed toward Leatherface, which is the much more interesting plot point that, due to the very short length of the film, does not get enough build up to be meaningful. Why not just have the film follow Sally the entire time? That seems to be the obvious, and smarter, choice.With unimpressive gore, zero meaningful character development, and a rushed plot, ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" continues the TCM tradition of poor sequels (or reboots, or requels, or whatever the kids are calling them nowadays). There is literally nothing memorable about this movie besides how shockingly unmemorable it actually is. While it was very nice to see Elsie Fisher back, her character was painfully underutilized to the point where it was almost disrespectful. In conclusion, this is a very disposable movie, one that can be compared to fast food - you can consume it without any trouble, but it will immediately leave your mind as soon as you're finished.",2022-02-21
"I'm a big fan of the 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' series. It may not be the cleverest or most unique horror series out there, but it is always relentlessly brutal and it also has a killer that isn't supernatural and who you could easily run into your self (if you were silly enough to be driving across rural Texas - no thank you, these films ruined ever doing that for me). I've been excited for this 2022 Netflix version ever since I heard of it. I read there were negative test screenings which was a downer, but I can confirm I had a great time with this movie.The first thing I noticed was a very unique setting they chose for this film compared to the rest of the series. Almost like a little deserted town in the middle of nowhere. I was fine with this until I saw that a busload (literally a busload) of tourists were coming in to check it out. The movie does a good job of keeping them well out of the way until their presence becomes necessary thankfully. More on that later.Something this series has done quite poorly over the years is making the main characters likeable. If the characters aren't likeable it's a lot harder to care about their fate. Unfortunately this film falls into the same traps again. Very early on they are verbally abusing strangers at gas stations and even kicking a woman out of her house for their own selfish gains. This is not a way to get us on side with them.The film is very short at only 83 minutes - and even then there is a very long credits so it's only really about 75 minutes of film. I think this was a good call though. It kept the pacing extremely fast and I suspect they cut out some of the things that test audiences didn't love.Coming back to the tourists on the bus, the bus scene in this film is one of the most brutal scenes I have ever seen. There's a very clunky and unfunny setup for it unfortunately (""you're cancelled, bro"" - what was that?), but once you get past that it is captivating theatre (if you can keep your eyes on the screen).The film has some very stupid character decisions near the end. They are necessary to keep the film going I guess you could argue, but man are they frustrating from a viewers point of view. Most horror films tend to have these, but these ones were particularly egregious.The final 60 seconds of this film are something else. I won't spoil anything. All I'll say is they got me good. Also if you're interested there is a brief after-credits scene to stick around for.I had a good time with this film. It's not without its flaws but it is almost certainly the entry I have enjoyed the most since the 2003 remake. 8/10.",2022-02-18
Things were going fine it was interesting not bad till the old lady with cow boy hat appears . The movie turns from horror to comedy. Why not just shoot rather than telling dialogues like in bollywood movies and getting killed. If nothing else to do one time watch is ok.,2022-02-19

"This movie was a waste of time. Not scary, not interesting and lame actors, usually Leatherface scares me but he wasn't scary at all in this movie. This whole Leatherface and Texas Chainsaw franchise needs to end its only so many times you can use the same plot over and over again. The Texas Chainsaw remake that was made in 2003 was the perfect horror movie and even the 2006 Texas Chainsaw the beginning was good but all other movies after that one was just pathetic including this 2022 version. I mean if you have Netflix give it a try but dont say I didn't warn you.",2022-02-23

"At we watching this movie last night, I came away not disappointed as such but more of a 'I have seen this before' and this to me was exactly like the new Halloween Kills movie, which I. Itself was a disappointing sequel but raised the gore and death scenes. This is exactly how I felt watching the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre film.This film wasn't bad in itself but once again it didn't bring anything new to the table but I felt for it to gain an audience it had to raise the stakes and it did with the death scenes, gory and over the top but that is the way films like this are going now.The acting was adequate, the story was okay, no tension what so ever, this being a direct sequel to the 1974 movie you feel as if it should have some tension like the original did but no it didn't.Overall not a bad film, will there be more? Depends on if enough people want it and Netflix are willing to buy the movies as these would die a death, pardon the pun, in the cinema.",2022-02-19
This movie is absolutely horrible! A waste of time!!!I only gave it a 2 because the gore was decent. I was excited for this to come out and watched on Netflix the day it came out. We were beyond disappointed. I can't believe they even felt confident enough to release this disaster of a film. The characters were a bunch of bratty liberals. I didn't even care if they died because they were so unlikable that they had me rooting for Leatherface. The old victim that came back for revenge had so many chances to kill him and she just let him walk right by her..laughable..like come on. Trust me when I say...do not waste your energy or time watching this..do something else.,2022-02-19

"I went in with high expectations, Texas Chainsaw being my favourite slasher franchises. I just thought they could've learned from their mistakes this time round and taken all the negatives from the flops and done without them, the posetives from the older installments and worked with them but no. Surely as a director of a movie with many past installments you sit and you do your research and learn what works and what doesn't. Seems like the same mistakes are just being repeated every time. The entire movie was just empty, pointless and lacked the grit and fear factor texas chainsaw was founded on.Netflix if you don't intend to take a movie seriously try not to create it maybe? We have enough lazy movies that nobody watches a second time round already.",2022-02-19
"I haven't liked a Texas Chainsaw movie in awhile. I greatly enjoy the first two, and I even think the 2003 version is a pretty good rendition. All the other sequels and reboots range from bad to awful and none of them capture the grittyness of the first flick. This is maybe the worst one. This just feels like a direct to video generic slasher.The new characters are all awful and obnoxious, I couldn't remember a name of anyone or a line if money was on the line. I also felt like a lot of the movie feels like a ripoff of the subpar Danny McBride Halloween from a couple years ago. This was just boringThis is gore soaked trash. At least the Matthew McConaughey one and the 3D one are laughably bad.",2022-04-06

Only 15 minutes in and Netflix already checked off most boxes on the woke-list. And they still managed to bring in every stereotype ever. Unwatchable garbage.,2022-04-24
"I'll admit, the first 10 or 15 minutes kind of seemed like this might be the rare actually entertaining attempt at a rehash of the glory that was the original. That lasted until the first murder, which had me howling out loud with laughter at how stupid and unbelievable it is. I won't describe it but it's the silliest thing I've ever seen try to be scary.And from there, the movie commits an even worse sin: it just gets boring. You know the deaths are coming, and they come, like ducks in a row. The film sets them up, and knocks them down. And that's it.I'm not surprised to see in the ""trivia"" section that this went straight to Netflix after disastrous test screenings.Halfway through, they bring back the heroine of the original, now an old woman, I suppose as some sort of Sarah Connor-type character. I dunno. That's as far into it as I am. I don't even know if I'm going to finish watching it.You can't just take a couple of the tropes from a classic movie, tweak the setting slightly, and dispense with most of what made it great. Otherwise you end up with something like this. Netflix should have known better.",2022-02-23
"I'm not sure that anyone watches these movies for the ""amazing plot,"" so I won't spare you the details (hint: it's not good, and rather bizarre). And if you're looking for gore, this film won't disappoint.But that is all it has going for it. Not a single moment of suspense, literally none. What made all the other films in this franchise interesting was the suspense. So many missed opportunities for a chase scene, or hiding from leather face. Every missed opportunity made me dislike the film more and more.If the producers and director spent 1/10th the time formulating a few suspenseful sequences as they did with the absurdly gratuitous gore (which ended up being really tasteless by the end) the movie would have been better balanced.Disappointing addition. The franchise seems done. Oh well.",2022-02-23
No one's talking about the fact it's set 50 years after the original which means learherface should be 80 and his mum long gone. But no he apparently doesn't age and is now invincible. Fantastic. Also the acting is awful and even the ending is daft like why would you put the car in auto pilot mode and start cracking jokes when you've just witnessed mass homicide! It's stupid and it's understandable why it wasn't a theatre release.,2022-02-21
Love how they shamelessly rip off Halloween 2018. This film was as bad as expected but fun to laugh at. They really will never understand what made the original Texas Chainsaw a masterpiece.Epilepsy warning for the ending credits. That was the most annoying and painful ending credits I've ever seen.,2022-02-19
"They shoehorned every woke, social justice, BLM cliché into this dreadful film they could in an attempt to drag it into the some sort of acceptable gore fest, but it failed miserably.It relies on over the top gore to replace any substance, story or character building and the tick box exercise on current social trends was so painful to watch I felt like I'd be attacked physically.I beg you not to waste your time watching this mess, it brings nothing to the table at all and everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves.",2022-02-28
I mean the guy must be like in his 60s and he really runs super fast and stealthy no-one can even hear him and boy o boy if he can take like 15 shots to chest and stomach and couple of chainsaw hits to the face.,2022-02-19
"Nothing about this movie is redeeming. It's an embarrassment and a waste of time. I am baffled with all the high ratings. The plot is ridiculous. The characters are cringy and so annoying. I know films like this aren't meant to win awards, but at least try to produce something half decent.",2022-02-20
"I'm all for horror movies. The original TCM will always be one of my all time favorites. This movie just lacked in SO many places.Before I get to the bad, I want to say the action, suspense, blood and gore, was 9/10. Who doesn't love a good slasher film.Now the bad. The writing was horrendous, bland and and flat. The plot was annoying, to be simply said. Absolutely no character development. You really don't know who these people are other than they're a ""cult"" of Gen Z'ers/ influencers, who decide to create a ""new home"" in a town that is known for its mass killings 30 years prior. How STUPID does that sound?",2022-02-22
"Woke social media influencer idiots are helplessly destroyed by leatherface. Totally brutal and gory but the characters are all pretty worthless. They can't load guns, they can't shoot guns, they have zero survival instincts, it's cheesy and full of one liners. Why not make them some what competent enough to at least defend themselves? Total garbage but full of laughs.",2022-02-18
It started off ok and showed real promise but lost it's way really quickly. I think it tried too hard to be relevant that the makers forgot about what made the original truely terrifying eg the scene on the bus with everyone filming was obvious and was used to create a big body count .take my advice forget any sequel or remake the only one that will give you real nightmates is the original.,2022-02-20
It's not a bad idea however from what I remember he was never superhuman with an inability to die yet in this he takes two direct shotgun shells to the abdomen and then a chainsaw slash to the lower face and nothing he's back like Micheal Myers. If they want to keep a series going don't make them all immortal just add a bit of sense and make them not take the killer hits!!!,2022-02-21
"Fortunately I turned this off after 20 to 30 minutes.. Terrible acting...Terrible story line, completely predictable...Racial and stereotype driven vs trying to be a true sequel to a masterpiece of horror.I got bored later in the evening and ended up finishing the movie. The ignorant racial tone ended and the movie got better for a bit. But ended up falling flat by the end. It also didn't make sense as a true sequel to the original movie. Leather Face moved really good and was very strong for a cannibal in his mid to late 70s that seemed to have never received proper or routine medical visits throughouthis life.All other entries into this film start out better and atleast they attempted to be entertaining vs a cheap political peice of garbage.. Netflix original movies are mostly Subpar...",2022-02-20
"Good for a laugh If you want to watch leatherface get upset over a property dispute, this movie is for you. First of all, guy has to be in early 70's at the very youngest. I lost all faith when he mowed through an entire bus of people only to get to a bathroom door, and cut a hole in it to try to unlock the door from the other side. With a chainsaw in the other hand. It's too stupid to not warn people. Please save yourselves.",2022-02-19

"This is an insult to both fans of, and the original itself. NOTHING works here, except for the gore, which is just gore for the sake of gore. The script sucks, the characters suck and the direction is amateurish. The producers/director havent understood the source material at all, and less said about what they've done with the character of Leatherface, the better. Worst movie of 2022 so far.",2022-02-19
"I dont usually like giving bad reviews but this movie was not all that great. The reason why it gets a 5/10 is because I loved all the characters, especially the old lady whos been waiting 50 yrs to get her revenge. Other then that, this movie is not something I can see over and over. Its 2022, now leave the Texas chainsaw massacre remakes alone, please stop! No more. Great characters, stupid ending and now with the looks of it, it may have to be a sequel so homegirl can get her revenge on leather face.",2022-02-19
"Honestly if you can get more than a half an hour into this garbage you're doing well. Another movie that has been trashed by the ""woke"" brigade. It is definitely the woke-saw massacre.",2022-02-22
Really boring. What a waste! Was expecting something more interesting than just a man chopping people up with a chainsaw. The part of Sally was really disappointing as well. I think part 2 was better and I hate that one too! No good storylines. Just a disappointment. Don't even bother watching it.,2022-02-19
This movie is the worst horror remake of all time. I can't believe anything more than .37 cents was put into this liberal left leaning agenda driven garbage movie. Please stop making movies that shove garbage down our throats.,2022-04-23
"In my eyes the first TCM was always overrated, and I found it to be more goofy that it actually was scary/disturbing. Call me crazy but it just doesn't match up to something like Halloween or The Exorcist. This movie is about as fun as a slasher can get so long as you don't get petty and picky.Short and sweet, the movie is far from boring, there are some creepy scenes, and the gore is crazy violent. Probably the most intense one yet. But as far as scary... I don't know what people want. How scary can it be to hear a chainsaw from 20 yards away? I mean these movies have never understood a chainsaw, the thing is loud, and you have to start it. So before any movie dorks go bashing this for not being ""real"" or ""raw,"" revise what you've seen in the past. Not one of these movies has been amazing. I actually liked the 2 remakes they made in the 2000s. Texas 3D was dryer than bark though, and I'm sure Leatherface sucks. This was fun so why knit pick? The ending was almost stupid but then it totally threw me off.Not a GREAT film but definitely a hell of a time. It's horror I mean what's next, give Jason Statham an Oscar for best chin-kick? Get real and enjoy yourself.",2023-02-28
"Hollywood is done. Another woke move, this is horrible, i really don't know what to write about this agenda. Today is the problem to be a white hetero man.",2022-02-19
Worst film I've seen this year so far. Could well stay the worst and there's over 10 months to go.But the most insulting thing is after 1 and a half hours of rubbish you get the most obvious and predictable ending which just cements how awful this film is.,2022-02-18
Wtf happened to this franchise. I never thought Texas Chainsaw Massacre would go WOKE. Kinda makes ya wanna root for Leatherface. The entire movie I'm lost for words.,2022-02-25
"I was extremely disappointed with the 2022 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I mean no acting, no storyline, no characters, nothing that I can really say is worth watching. Please, please, please, stop making sequels or remakes of older good movies.",2022-02-19
"Honestly just cringey all this woke gen-z stuff literally ruins everything it's in, the cringey one liners and references just make it feel like a knock off comedy. Please for the love of god can the new generation grow a pair and stop being so sensitive thanks..👍",2022-02-18
"If this were released in the 1990s at Blockbuster, I'm sure it'd have the biggest of stickers on the cover that stated: ""BRAND NEW!"" so people don't mix up the titles.Well, I did have high expectations for this due to the wait and I was a huge fan of 2017's Leatherface. And it really didn't let me down. It was plenty GORE and BRUTALITY. But it also had a wacky plot with TONS of WTF & YEAH, RIGHT moments. And, all of this is on par for the TCM Franchise.In yet ANOTHER Part 2 to the original, the OG survivor, Sally Lee Strode, returns to seek revenge on the big LF. But, LF is also on his own rampage and more ruthless, aggressive and murderous than he's ever been in the series thus far. I'd mention there are moronic young adults also in the mix so LF has targets, but they're just awful.I really tried to get into the plot, but the more I thought about it and saw the huge holes, I got angrier. So, I did what I probably should've in the beginning. Watch it for what it is.And DANG...yes, let loose, leave your brain at the door and get ready to be surprised and blown away.But...also frustrated when that plot and character mistakes as big as Texas rushes back into your face. Kinda think of this as a Godzilla movie. You expect all the humans to make every mistake they possibly could, but you didn't come to a Godzilla movie for the puny humans.***Final Thoughts: Here's my ranking of the franchise from BEST to TRASH:1. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)
2. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003)
3. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning (2006)
4. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986)
5. Leatherface (2017)
6. Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2022)
7. Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III (1990)

9. Texas Chainsaw 3D.",2022-02-19
The most ridiculous movie you will ever watch.I kept on skipping and skipping the scenes.They shot him more that ten bullets with a shotgun and hit his face with a chainsaw and he is still alive hahaha.The time I had spent watching this movie will keep hunting me.,2022-02-19

"Low budget B movie standard
Totally wrong cast
Mediocre acting

"I am a huge slasher movie fan. I can handle a bad movie. I call most of the Friday the 13th movies ""not that bad."" So believe me when I say that THIS MOVIE is awful.I spent the better part of the last couple days watching the TCSM movies available on Netflix, ending with this one. It has bad reviews, but so do all slasher films and I still enjoy them. But oh. My. God. This was horrible.Note: The actors themselves were not bad at all. They did the best they could with the script they were given, which is like giving a chef a pile of various animal droppings and telling them to make a meal of it.The Idiot Plot is in full force the entire time. At one point, Sally (the sole survivor of the original film) has the killer at gun point and tells him to ""say her name"" even though it's pretty well established that he can't speak. She begs him to remember her, even though her experience was 50 years ago and he has the mind of an 8 year old. Spoiler alert: She doesn't shoot him. She actually lets him pick up his chainsaw and walk past her out of the room.The Idiot Plot comes back later when the character played by Sarah Yarkin has picked up the killer's chainsaw and is charging at him screaming bloody murder. Does she slash him in half? No. Does she stab him through the gut? No. Does she do anything remotely lethal with the most lethal power tool you can buy at Walmart? No. She uppercuts him with it, leaving a small gash on his chin yet somehow propelling him backward. And if you really thought he was dead and defeated after that, go get an MRI and check for a brain tumor.And, golly gee wilickers who could've guessed, he's not dead. As Yarkin and Fisher are happy and jovially driving away, making light of the whole situation that killed their friends for some reason, surprise surprise the killer grabs Yarkin through the window and cuts her head off, even though she had rightfully earned the title of Final* Girl. Roll credits.Oh and how could I forget that one featured extra even 'threatens' the killer by telling him that he's going to ""be cancelled"" if he tries anything while a whole doomed crowd records him on their cell phones. At that moment, I admit, I internally cheered when the killer revved his chainsaw.I watched the original TCSM. I watched the remake. I watched the prequel to the remake. I watched the reboot which was a sequel to the original. And I would happily watch any of those movie on a loop than rewatch this movie even once.",2022-04-16
"What is it with films like these, first the new Halloween had a 70ish old Mike Myers and now an even older Leatgerface, why can't they just reimagine it with something else, or just stop making it.I can't imagine a 70 year old killer bumping off people with such ease, on top of that not dying even after being shot, stabbed & drowned. How stupid can these movies (including Halloween) get!!Stop making these (and people, stop watching, please)Best avoided IMHO.",2022-02-26
If one of them knew how to use a gun properly this dude would be dead already! Its so cringe how none of them can kill him with a gun and he can magically keep chainsawing them!This could of all been over if that blonde girl just shot him in the back with the sheriffs gun while in the van...most of the characters are so clueless they deserve to get chopped up.Unrealistic and poor acting and a guy that has 49 lives.,2022-02-25
"Though the movie itself is fun and packs some of the same bloody magic as the originals, It is far to obvious that this is another Netflix adaptation of an existing franchise in so many ways.

"Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2022), the Netflix original sequel to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), is one of the most insulting things I've ever seen. It tries to be the Gen-Z'er's timeline of Texas Chainsaw films, and as a result, made one of the most pandering horror movies I've seen in some time. The acting was subpar, the story was beyond stupid, and the script was a joke. ""Try anything and you're cancelled bro."" Like, who the heck says that?If you're a younger individual wanting to get into horror, watch the original TCSM film. It's much more worth your time and is infinitely better than this.",2022-03-01

The only thing that I quite enjoy was the end!",2022-02-22

"Tobe Hooper's 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' is a landmark film of the 1970s, and one of the most important horror films ever made.David Blue Garcia's 2022 version is the exact opposite.I'm sure the writers meeting went something like this: ""Hey that Halloween 2018 sequel made a ton of money. Let's just copy that.""So like Halloween, this movie is a direct sequel to the original. That means Leatherface would now be close to 80 years old. And for some reason, the character is suddenly invincible like Michael Meyers. Shotgun blasts do nothing.Halloween also brought back the Laurie Strode character, so naturally the writers of this movie brought back the Sally Hardesty character with a new actress (she was played by Marilyn Burns in the original movie). And then literally just discarded her character like garbage.Marilyn deserves better. Tobe deserves better. And we the fans deserve better.",2022-02-19
"Had super low expectations. But everytime leatherface showed up my heart was beating. That's what horror should do. But the partying and weird story was bland and plain. It's as bloody as Halloween Kills. Leatherface is a MONSTER. So I will give it the rating for getting Leatherface right and being a bit creepy. But as far as story like Gaslight, Godfather...it's an 8 in the Horror Genre, and 5/10 in Hollywood Movie World...A Chainsaw is the most violent weapon you can use in my opinion. Even Scarface (1983) could only show you so much Chainsaw Violence...This is Chainsaw Galore. Nothing more. Not even gonna compare it to the 1974 original because that's where the fun stops. Nothing compares except they both have the same runtime length. I ignored all wokeness and racism they threw in because it was so forced. So ignore the small 5% of racism and wokeness and you're good to go.",2022-02-18
The most frightening aspect of the film was I managed to reach the end of this vile mess. Even for a Netflix film this is terrible. If you are a fan of the original then do not watch this as you will want to chainsaw through the TV!,2022-02-21
"It's clear that the folks behind 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2022)', the latest so-called legacy sequel that ignores most of the movies in its franchise, don't understand any of the things that their film is supposedly about - be it gentrification, gun violence, cancel culture, or even good ol' Leatherface himself. It's as if they couldn't decide whether they wanted to make a straightforward slasher, an ode to the original or a thematically rich commentary; as such, they failed to make anything other than an eighty-minute snoozefest.To be fair, there are aspects of the picture that work relatively well. Its most consistent aspect is its cinematography, which is also one of its highlights. Frankly, the film looks really good (a scene set in a sunflower field at night is almost stunning), though it is sorely missing the grungy atmosphere of its predecessor. Generally, the picture is competently constructed from a technical point of view. It also features some absolutely brutal, blood-and-viscera-spewing violence that sets it apart from some of its peers.The problem is that the gore, despite being both full-on and surprisingly convincing, has no real impact. Bones are broken, heads are bashed in, faces are sliced off, and there is indeed a chainsaw massacre, but the picture is never even close to scary and often feels as though it is eschewing actual suspense in favour of splashing bodily fluids. It also doesn't help that the piece gives us very few characters to actually root for and even goes so far as to position our heroes as slightly in the wrong at the start. That would be fine if we weren't supposed to root for them, but the rest of the feature asks us to care about their attempts to outrun their assailant. Naturally, this saps what little tension may have remained in the movie's more anxiety-inducing moments. The flick also can't decide if it wants to promote straightforward survival or aim for a 'now it's our turn' sort of feel, which makes its messaging seem really inconsistent and leads to a few instances in which it tries to have its cake and eat it too (which includes the suitably frustrating but also somewhat laughable ending).Still, there are a handful of sequences that are effective. It's a shame that the infamous bus scene starts in the way that it does, because its escalation into all-out evisceration is genuinely quite startling. The overall scene plays out in a claustrophobically chaotic way that comes very close to getting under your skin, but the sour taste of its opening moments lingers long after they're over and - along with a few other moments of almost wacky violence - make the set-piece seem very tonally incongruent with the rest of the straight-faced feature (it would have worked much better if the flick had a tongue-in-cheek tone ala 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986)'). If you want to see a big bulking bloke brutalise a bunch of defenceless people, you'll get what you came for. The thing is, though, there's very little reason to care about anything that's happening. Even if you do just go with it, as it were, most of the movie is simply really dull.A lot of it is really stupid, too, and it handles its misguided social commentary with all the subtlety of Leatherface's sledgehammer. Its implied attitude towards gun control is worryingly close to that whole 'good guy with a gun' thing, especially because it frames a central character's eventual use of a firearm as a reclamation of the trauma she has previously experienced. A mindless slasher really isn't the place to be commenting on school shootings. A mindless slasher is exactly what this is, too. There isn't anything inherently wrong with that, but the moniker is something that can't be applied to the formative 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)' or even its much more comedic sequel.This picture ultimately just doesn't feel like a 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' movie. It handles its connections to the original incredibly poorly, especially when it comes to its returning characters. I don't want to spoil anything, but Sally is completely underused here; in fact, she's arguably disrespected. Leatherface is reduced to an almost supernaturally unstoppable killing machine, closer to someone like Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees (incidentally, if you swapped the chainsaw for a machete and the skin mask for a hockey mask, this film could easily have been a 'Friday The 13th (1980)' remake/ requel and would likely have been better for it). I mean, the guy unironically throws his chainsaw not once, but twice (in a move ripped straight out of his 'Mortal Kombat X (2015)' guest appearance) and the flick expects us to take him seriously from the second he steps into frame, his unmasked face hidden from the camera for no real reason other than that seems to be the thing to do with these sorts of characters. This leatherface is, to put it plainly, boring. The movie even opts to outright ignore the rest of the Sawyer clan, almost pretending that they (along with their cannibalistic tendencies) never existed in the first place, and it's all the more generic because of it. That family dynamic has been a part of pretty much every entry in the franchise for good reason; it is sorely missed here.Ultimately, this picture misses the mark in almost every area. It has some decently intense sequences, is soaked in over-the-top gore and is shot surprisingly well, but it lacks any real teeth and slips from the mind as easily as it enters it. It feels as though it has no identity, a film struggling to grasp at ideas and aesthetics just out of its reach. It's rather frustrating, actually. It isn't terrible, but it's just so uninteresting that it's hard to muster up the energy to even talk about. That alone says volumes. It's a bland, lifeless sequel that you're likely to forget about as soon as you've finished telling someone how bad it is. 4/10.",2022-03-06
The movie was directed well and the acting was good. Overall it was a good scary movie. But the ending was a disappointment as are most scary movies these days.,2022-02-21
Another bad sequel like leatherface in this movie every thing is overboard average peoples die except main characters and they giving second chances to killer cinematography is not good soundtrack is bad and everything is cliche.I'm confused is it worth watching atleast for one time or not?,2022-02-18
Really stupid and probably offensive movie. Basically no characters and just unlikeable meatbags. The main characters arc of being a school shooting victim who overcomes that trauma by shooting leatherface with a gun seems pretty offensive and doesn't belong in such a stupid movie.Other than the first kill the other kills looked awful as well. Had to rewind in a couple of parts to see what even happened.,2022-02-19
"What a dumb movie. At first it tried to be woke, then the dumb writing murdered the movie. So many missed opportunities, not for the writing, but to end the movie early.

Just another remake, reboot that is riding on the franchise name.",2022-02-19
"The first act of the movie centers around gun control and rebel flags and teen drama. Definitely not what I was wanting out of TCM or any slasher for that matter.

"I'm stunned at what I just watched. First off the movie begins with a bunch of woke nonsense.Anti Gun
Dixie Flag
School Shooting
Yuppies
iWatch Commercial
Electric Car
The list goes on and on.After you get past all the wokeness this film has to offer you basically have a movie that makes no sense. The mechanic general contractor doesnt give them back the keys he took from them so they can leave and survive but instead keeps the keys and rushes towards danger only to die.The original girl who survives the first film in 1974 is now Rambo and has been waiting 50 years for this very moment but when she is alone with a shotgun in a room with Leatherface can't bring herself to kill him because she wants him to recognize her. But magically is able to shoot at him right when he is about to kill one of the other girls after she just got her entire body cut up with a chainsaw and lies dying yet can still shoot at him to stop him from killing one of the main characters. (Taking a page out of Halloween where Jamie Lee Curtis was waiting years to get revenge on Michael Myers, Oh please try to be original next time Fede Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues.)One sister takes a short sledge hammer to the chest or face falls through the stairs into the basement yet isn't winded and is perfectly fine, yea that makes a lot of sense. One of those hammers would crush your chest in.I can't even recall how many times they are about to almost die or get cut up by a chainsaw only to magically survive. It happens over and over and over and gets old really fast.Do yourself a favor and if you want to watch a Texas Chainsaw Massacre film. Watch the 1974 version at night with the lights turned off. Don't bother watching any other version as they all SUCK. Much like many other horror franchise that end up getting worse and worse.Come up with something original and stop rehashing old franchises, they aren't making them better they are actually making them worse.Fede Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues should be shamed at how bad they did with the script of this movie. They aren't capable of writing a good script and should think of a career change.",2022-04-03
"Mediocre acting. If you're looking for your gory, slasher film this is it. Definitely doesn't compare to the previous Texas Chainsaw Massacres. I will say it's something like your typical movie how they always run up in the house instead of down and away or skip right past the weapon. I don't know who will die first in life Michael Myers or Thomas Hewitt!",2022-02-20
"The characters in the movie are so stupid that they can only scream. Sally waited more than 50 years for revenge but didn't kill when she got the chance, then she died stupidly. I also find the acting of some actors was not good.",2022-02-18
"Yet another ridiculous entry in an overgrown franchise- Texas Chainsaw Massacre offers nothing valuable to the horror genre or franchise itself- proving to be yet another mediocre waste of time. Although I didn't enjoy this film, there are a few decent qualities it has. An early scene in the police car can be fun gruesome, and suspenseful. Its cinematography is honestly fantastic and Eight Grade actress Elsie Fisher does prove to be a decent lead. Its moderately entertaining, but honestly, it's so stupid at times it feels like a joke. The needless references to Gen-Z culture within this film is honestly quite cringey to watch most of the time, feeling like a bunch of older men trying to relate to a younger audience than ever putting us in our younger characters shoes. The acting is also pretty mediocre for the most part concerning the rest of the characters, and returning actress Olwen Fouere from the original is actually so laughable bad and obvious at times that I had a hard time looking at the screen- and listening to her lines. Her character was so incredibly pointless, clearly being an obvious gimmick trying to grow the film to the likes of other belated sequels like the more recent Halloween and Scream. Besides her though, some of the characters just make the stupidest decisions i've seen in a horror movie in sometime- and one of the dumbest endings. In the end, Texas Chainsaw Massacre does nothing to contribute to the long running franchise of which I have never enjoyed from the beginning. It can be entertaining and has some great cinematography, but as a film itself, it's a mess and will most likely be forgotten among the countless other films this franchise has produced over the years.My Rating: 3.5/10.",2022-02-28
"Not as bad as I was expecting. Thank god the viewing time is only 1hr & 15mins. Its a sequel to the original. Very gory in parts and eye rolling in other parts.Basically a bunch of self entitled lefties call an old woman a racist and throw her and her son out of their own house. She dies after basically telling her son she knows he's a Trans on the inside. He avengers her death. Then tries her make up on and wears a dress before getting annoyed at the people that don't accept him for who he is. Then kills them all except one.Quite the comedy in parts. Not your typical Netflix nonsense, but not far off.",2022-02-18
I love Elsie Fisher from Eighth Grade but did she have to steep so low to take this part? She is so much better than this. This is the worst Chainsaw Massacre film by far. It didn't make any sense at all. Leatherface is a force of nature and not to be controlled at all by anybody. Typical woke casting too which ruined the film as usual.,2022-02-18
"The remakes/reboots/continuities past the ""original"" series (finishing with Next Generation) have in my opinion all been good entries!The 2003 remake and 2005 prequel are two of my most favourite horror movies.Sadly, this entry is nothing but a money grab! I'm so glad it was released straight to Netflix and I didn't have to spend money going to the theatre to see it. There are throughout, blatant, let's say ""nods"" and not rip offs to the Halloween 2018 style of continuity ... but for the most part it's a House of Wax/Wrong Turn 5 single sound stage scenario.Those of you who are reading this are going to watch it regardless (because we're die hard horror groupies and we're exactly who the studio has relied upon) ... but my partner is not a massive horror fan and it's taken me a while to get him into it. I'm not going to show him this, I don't want him to be taking steps backwards.",2022-02-18
"Everything about this movie was horrible. The cast is atrocious. The plot is bad. The whole half done Halloween 2018 revenge plot line. The ""people"" in this movie were dumb as hell. It is so so so bad. They simply just wanted to make a slasher with a lot of gore. Kill this franchise already. Please.",2022-02-18
"I love the original chainsaw massacre and the one with Jessica biel in it. Anything past that is total butchery and a crime in my eyes. This one was just another whack remake to add the the pile.I was forced to watch this as it was my daughters night to choose I tried to be positive and go in with an open mind but it was dreadful from beginning to end. And when they whacked their phones out on the bus that was the straw that broke the camels back for me, it became laughable.Please film makers stop wrecking these timeless classics and come up with your own material. It's actually quite insulting when all your doing is trying to get a quick payday from timeless classic like the Texas chainsaw massacre.",2022-09-14
"So basically any movies made after 2020 aiming for the 18-45 demographic is going to be a huge liberal attempt at wokeness and cancel culture. In essence I was rooting for Leatherface the whole time.Liberals have ruined sports, music, and now film.",2022-03-12
"Quite a low rating for this sequel of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I'm surprised by that because I thought it was a good slasher. Maybe a bit lesser scary than the original but with a lot of good scenes of gore. I don't know what people expected from a slasher? For me it was exactly what I wanted to see, some good old chainsaw butchering. Leatherface can't be killed so get used to it. Okay that's not realistic but who cares? The acting wasn't bad at all, the story was okay, the gore was excellent, so perfect slasher evening I would say.",2022-03-21
"If a horror film is going to have social commentary shoe horned into it, I don't want to hear it from annoying and uninteresting characters. This film is definitely better than ""The Next Generation"" but I'm sure they were aiming a little higher than that. It may also be superior to some other TCM sequels but it also may not be. I don't want to watch it a few more times to give it such an assessment but I think that would be the fair way to rate it against its predecessors.Bottom line is, the TCM franchise has too many ""back to true form"" sequels that rarely deliver. Of course they aren't the only ones to have done this but the result of it is a franchise having more messy of a timeline than the Halloween films. After TCM 2 in 1986 the only sequel with actual value is the 2003 film and that's all.This film here has joined the list of these ""back to true form"" sequels that failed to deliver.",2022-02-18

"Why did they bother with this? The story is rubbish, the set up isn't great. It's just a waste of time. I honestly thought this was 'son of leatherface' as he didn't seem old enough to have been the original one. At one point a character is pointing a shotgun at leatherface, could have killed him with very little effort....but doesn't. Lets him walk off then goes running after him to shoot him. Everything about this film is just pointless and dull. There are a few interesting kills, but other than that it's a waste of everyone's time.",2022-02-21
"I say it every time I sit down and watch one of these awful movies, Why do they make the characters so stupid that you actually end up rooting for the psychopath rampaging killer?? I always thought you were supposed to want the people to escape. Maybe even actually kill the bad guy. Like really kill him. Not just shoot or stab him like a mortal human because we all know that these bad guys are somehow born with super human strength. Just forget about the ""story"" because like this one it's borderline trash! Again, the people are so stupid and would never do the things we are led to believe they would do. Example: Find your friend with his face half cut off and go back to the rest of the friends and say NOTHING! Just sit on a bus with the door closed and not tell anyone why. Wtf!! Some people love these movies and can look past all that stuff and I honestly wish I could do the same. I can't. I've tried. And since I'll do it again hoping for a different outcome, maybe I'm the one of the stupid ones also!",2022-03-01
"The acting isn't good, the casting is bad, the characters are unlike-able, and make extremely foolish decisions (even for a horror slasher).But hey, I didn't turn it off... perhaps the amazing music I was playing in the background helped keep me distracted. One thing I did like is the Minor twist it had and the murders were quite entertaining.However if you're going to watch one of these franchise, then just watch one of the other ones, unless you just want something to play in the background, where you can look up and see some cool death scenes with the classic chainsaw.",2022-02-18
"Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a very misguided slasher sequel that splatters the screen with blood and guts while paving the way for a host of idiotic moves.It was such an unnecessary and ill-advised decision to bring back the original film's protagonist, Sally Hardesty. The filmmakers clearly attempted what the recent Halloween ""requel"" did - but failed miserably. They end up turning a resilient survivor into a stupid, vengeful hillbilly who apparently had been waiting 50 years for a chance at payback? Leatherface has been doing bugger all (apparently) for decades, so you're best chance is probably to catch him off guard when he's not pissed off while his trusty chainsaw is buried behind his bedroom wall...Also, one of the female characters has a poorly handled arc: a victim of a school shooting who understandably shudders at the mere touch of a gun suddenly (within the space of half hour) begins wielding one! Just do away with the pointless backstory. It served no purpose.Texas Chainsaw Massacre is filled with messy moments like this - from characterisation to storytelling - and it's frustrating and lazy in equal measure. Like how characters receive fatal injuries and inexplicably revive 10 minutes later (cue eye roll) only to die a few minutes after that. I'm disappointed to see the likes of Fede Álvarez involved here. He's proven he's way better than this.Finally, the bus bloodbath is a glorious bit of chainsaw savagery when taken as an individual scene (and forgetting the lame attempt to incorporate some social media commentary), but it's an example of why this film is all gore and no horror. The original has barely any on-screen violence and is terrifying for its simplicity, but this is often sadistic for the sake of it, and severely lacking in imagination where true horror is concerned - a typical modern slasher that's a far cry from the subgenre's glory days.4/10.",2022-02-19
"Characters = irritating and very very stupid
Storyline = crap
Acting = laughable
Gore = only good thing about the film.Doesn't do any justice to the original
The old woman chasing leatherface says she's been chasing him for 50 years, yet he's not aged at all makes no sense.I'm not sure how possible it is either that after been lifted off the floor with a chainsaw through your stomach and then being tossed aside to be able to live for a good 10 minutes AND shoot a a gun.",2022-02-19
"To preface this review I will say I'm a huge movie and horror buff in general. I've seen all the common and even uncommon old and new horror franchises and I've never seen a movie this wickedly gory.The story was decent im not sure what other reviewers are going on about. I thought it was a interesting take on bringing back another movie, it wasn't amazing but alright. The characters did bug me at the start especially the woman, she's pretty loud mouthed and insults the guy at the gas station for no reason, besides being a jerk which isn't good when your meant to be the protagonist. The acting was decent but I did find the phone recording scenes cringey and lame, just don't. The ending was pretty dang cheesy but it's a slasher flick and just a short one at that. I think that did good to have a fun filled movie that wasn't trying too hard to be the original.Now let's talk about the gore, this was a somewhat short run time film but had so much gore that even my partner who deals with horses with snapped ligaments was cringing at this. One scene he snapped a guy's wrist and used the bone from his rest to.. you get that point.Overall I'd reccomend this as a watch for sure if your into gore, but I have warned you there is definitely gore and horrendous injuries. A fun flick to watch when your bored that isn't copying the original.",2022-06-01
"What alot of crap. This IP has slowly gone down the crapper like all the old classics did. 'Bring back the old characters, make it modern for the early adult audience... Instagram and School shootings as a plot drive' this is why horror and films in general are jokes nowadays. For a ""Human"" leatherface gets shot 3,4 times, ran over and survived a car crash. The 'Innocent one being the bad ass cliché' kicks far too late. Overall, avoid this film if yoy enjoye the old, good TCM films.",2022-02-22

"Right, well I have to say that I was somewhat skeptical about this 2022 movie ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" from writers Chris Thomas Devlin, Fede Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues. Why? Well, let's just face it that the 2017 movie ""Leatherface"" wasn't exactly a great movie.But as I had the opportunity to sit down and watch the latest addition to the franchise, of course I did so, as this is a horror/slasher movie that I hadn't already seen.Well, director Jonathan Liebesman did deliver a more enjoyable and entertaining slasher movie here in 2022, so it was a step up from the somewhat abysmal ""Leatherface"" movie. And I will say that I was actually adequately entertained by the 2022 ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" movie.There were a good amount of violence, mayhem, bloodshed and gore here, so an old gorehound like myself was definitely well satisfied. And especially the scene inside the bus was amazing. That scene alone makes it well worth sitting down to watch ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"".For the most part, then it was mainly unfamiliar faces on the cast list, with the occasional familiar face, but they did actually have some rather nicely cast actors and actresses on the cast list here. And it was certainly nice to see the likes of Alice Krige, Moe Dunford and William Hope in the movie.I was entertained by ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", and pleasantly so. But then again, I was sitting down to watch the movie with zero expectations.My rating of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",2022-02-18
"What a sloppy sad excuse as an addition to this franchise. The new generation has butchered another classic yet again and doing so by adding the same level of lazy no talent acting to salt the ever gaping wound of remakes.

Big no for me...Started watching it then as soon as I saw the Tesla I basically lost all interest. Lol having a Tesla in any remote American town would be a no no as where would you charge it? And 2) it's like a million miles from town to town.Then as it's a Netflix movie the gore is toned down. Lastly once again as it's a Netflix movie you'll have literally all ethnicities in the movie even though not all towns have all ethnicities. Lmao.,2022-02-18

"Forgive me - but I don't know which is funnier - the film itself or the comments from those reviewers who slate it. Seriously- don't take the film too seriously. Of course there are more plot holes in this film than a cheese grinder. But I think the film makers know this and indeed deliberately made it so as most scenes were tongue-in-cheek.For me, the gory scenes in the bus was genuis: I found it difficult to stop laughing. Indeed, the makers of the Scream franchise must be going green with envy.Thoroughly enjoyed this horror romp which was as comedic as it was gory.Enjoy 😉",2022-04-03

They don't do it quick enough for me.The victims are typical of this generation, only care about them selves, beyond rude and so unlikeable whilst pretending to care that I honestly didn't care that the killer was after them. The two sisters made some of the most ridiculous decisions even for a horror movie.The killer had pretty much used a chainsaw to saw a woman in half and she still managed to stay alive to shoot him! The bus scene was the most pathetic (they are all trying to save their lives by pathetically banging on sliding windows)!If this is the best this era has to offer then just stick with the old films.",2022-02-19
"Almost fifty years have passed since the events depicted in the original 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' and in that time the chain saw wielding maniac dubbed 'Leatherface' was never identified. A new bunch of young adults has come to the remote corner of Texas; this time it is a group of entrepreneurs who have purchased an abandoned town with the intention of selling the various properties. Unfortunately they didn't realise that one building is still occupied by an elderly woman and her adult son... and she claims to have the deeds to the property. She collapses during the argument and dies on the way to hospital. Her son cuts off her face and wears it over his own... Leatherface is back! Once back in town he starts a killing spree that will see most characters meet a grisly death.Back in 1973 Tobe Hooper set out to make a PG rated horror movie but, despite lacking gore or other events that might garner a higher rating managed to create one of the scariest films ever made... almost fifty years, and several sequels, later this film arrives and despite there being a lot of very gory deaths it doesn't come close to the scariness of the original. The story is solid enough although the basic set up is obviously just an excuse to have Leatherface pick up his chain saw and start killing again. The central group of characters is solid, especially sisters Melody and Lila and their friend Dante. While not everything happened quite as expected most key things that happen are hardly surprising. There are a couple of fairly weak attempts at comedy, such as characters trying to film Leather face on their phones rather than being terrified! These aren't enough to spoil the film though. For the most part it isn't that scary, although the final scenes do manage to produce some scares as one wonders whether the character set up as the obvious 'final girl' will actually be a survivor. The cast is decent enough; I particularly liked Sarah Yarkin and Elsie Fisher, who played Melody and Lila. At just over eighty minutes in length it certainly doesn't drag on too long; the makers are to be commended for not padding it out to two hours plus like some film makers seem to need to do even if the material doesn't justify it. Overall I wouldn't say this is a must see but it is worth watching if you are a fan of the slasher genre.",2022-02-20
Not bad but as scary as a box of kittens...the original was still the best and you cannot improve it no matter how hard you try. Best scene is on the bus...i totally laughed out loud although I'm not sure that is what they intended you to do. Tight filming at 84 minutes makes it bearable but still not the original Tobe Hooper masterpiece.,2022-02-18
If you like gore you are in for a treat. After the first kill its a blood fest and doesn't stop til the end. Better than expected. There are a lot worse Netflix horror movies. If you have a spare 80 mins watch this.,2022-02-18
How did these people set up auctioning off a town? Why did the girl go with the police officers and the dying woman? Why did everyone feel guilty about the dying woman in the first place? Why did the woman on the bus keep letting people leave and not tell them there is a psycho outside? They almost left but she did not tell the bus driver that there was a killer out there. This was the dumbest movie I've ever seen.,2022-02-19

I thought the movie had a good feel to it. The gore was on point and pretty gnarly. Cast were alright. The influencer part had nothing to do with the actual film and if you look past it you see the actual story. Something about the time frame doesn't work though. Some parts of the movie especially what happens on the bus and near the end are pretty sad in some cases. Overall not a bad sequal and in some cases better than other entries into the leatherface franchise.,2022-02-19

"So first of all, it's just what you would expect from a slasher film. The characters make dumb decisions, and leatherface almost seems like a supernatural being seeing as how he can get stabbed and shot multiple times and not die. However, once the violence started it literally did not stop right up until the very end. And it doesn't hold back, lots of blood and lots of carnage. So as I said it's what you should expect and if you go into knowing what you're getting into, you should enjoy it as I did.",2022-02-19

As horror movies go they all deserved to die.",2022-02-24
"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise as a whole is very much a mixed bag, while the 1974 original is a true genre classic, one of the best horror movies of all-time, but the other entries have never really lived up to the original. Unfortunately this 9th entry in the saga follows the same route as most of the other sequels by being simply mediocre.Obviously this one was following the Halloween 2018 route by ignoring all the other sequels by having it directly follow the first one (haven't they already done this), but thankfully at a slim 74 minutes this movie never outstays its welcome. Because this is so short in length it still falls a tad short as a legacy sequel to the original film as the connection feels tacked on at best. Although there are some positives to be had here like the director does create some solid tension and some cool disturbing visuals and thankfully there's enough gore to keep the horror fans happy.The two sisters were the standouts here with Sarah Yarkin being a more than capable final girl and gives an all-round solid performance. Elise Fisher is also solid as the other sister Lila and forms a strong sisterly bond with Yarkin that does just enough to make you root for their survival. But bringing back the Sally Hardesy character from the original and having someone else play her felt a bit disrespectful to the late Marylin Burns, but the new actress Olwen Fourere does do a rather decent job with the role even if there is a slight disconnect as a viewer as true fans know that this isn't the same person who survived the original.What really works in this movie is the intense violence and gore, also Mark Burnham's imposing performance as Leatherface is a firm highlight of this movie and just watching him chase after the characters really elevates the fear factor here. On the whole this new 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' does just enough to please horror fans in the moment and it is certainly better than the last 2 awful entries 2013's 'Texas Chainsaw 3D' & 2017 'Leatherface' and I was never bored watching this, I certainly entertained, but it needed that something extra to justify another sequel in which it didn't really do.",2022-02-18

"Conceptually, this is a direct sequel to the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre which means Leatherface has got to be on the young side of seventy, out here killing teenagers (the normal slasher film architype). So, what you're looking at is a metaphor on how an old school player is teaching these youngins how it goes down.There is a moment in which Leatherface shows his genuine emotions of how he feels about today's youth and cancel culture that really got me into this film. Then I loved how the original slasher pulled out all his old moves like an aging wrestler getting back into the ring for that nostalgia paycheck. There were a lot of scenes that were just shot for shot from the original movie, but it just felt like a you can't teach an old dog new tricks angle than copying for fan service (when I'm sure it's the latter overall)It starts off unimpressively slow, but is filled with good kills, so you can't go wrong.",2022-02-19

God forbid somebody make something original or even an original sequel to this near 50 year old franchise. What's the saying if it ain't broke don't fix it?

I was absolutely gutted because they could of made this an amazing film but they agreed on an awful plot, awful acting, awful character development, just awful everything.

As she is being transported to the hospital she dies--which really upsets leatherface who goes on a killing spree seeking revenge.

I was scared that this was gonna be too short but an hour in a I wanted it to hurry up and end. This movie felt like an incomplete idea. In the age of remakes, direct sequels or ""requels"" if you will, this film never succeeded in deciding what it truly was. I'll take a guess and say the writers took a page out of Halloween (2018) and tried to revamp a classic horror film timeline with the main protagonist coming back to get some redemption. Except in this movie no one, including this audience gets any fulfillment or redemption.The characters all fell flat, no character development, no cohesive plot, and the time line is confusing. I'm not sure who to route for because I don't have any background or story to understand who anybody is.",2022-02-18
"This is exactly the sequel someone would make if they've never seen the original TCM. Like, if all you knew about the original was that it featured a killer named Leatherface who used a chainsaw to kill people with, this is what you would come up with. No Sawyer family, no subtlety, no satire, no intelligence, not the slightest understanding of the character of Leatherface or the world he inhabits. Just a generic killer with a chainsaw, lots of gore, a bunch of jump scares, some unlikeable victims and your usual slasher shenanigans. It's loud, dumb, silly, bland, forgettable and not at all scary. With all this said, however, it's fine for what it is. If you want to watch a dude with a chainsaw hacking up beautiful idiots in gruesome fashion, then you'll like this just fine. And at 83 minutes, it is mercifully short!",2022-09-30

"Seriously, the guy's footwear style slaps! Besides that, I didn't like this movie almost at all. Big fan of Tobe Hooper's 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' it is iconic; undoubtedly one of the most terrifying films ever made. Even part 2 and some of the other entries in the franchise, I've enjoyed. But this film right here was just ridiculous. It consisted of one dumb character decision after another (they needed to go with the old lady in the ambulance AND back to the house to look for the deed? Really????), eye-rolling dialogue and a really tacky-looking Leatherface. Plus, he'd be something like 80 years old in 2022 so...yeah, there's that. Also there was no reason to bring Sally back. The gore is okay I guess but doesn't make up for the rest of the film being flat and not scary. I will eventually watch it again because t is a TCM film after all and I tend to give franchise films more chances even when I don't love them, but as of right now I can say this one is highly underwhelming.",2022-02-19

Writing is bad, plot is bad, acting is bad.So millenials invade this town for social media hype and kick an old lady and her son (leatherface) out of her house causing her to have a heart attack and die. He wanted revenge and I wanted him to have it LOL. Nobody has the common sense to just leave town. Instead they hide in the most ridiculous places hoping that the masked killer will just forget about them, really. And just when I thought the riduculousness couldn't get any worse, here comes the bus scene.I have never in my life rooted for the bad guy to kill the whole cast of characters. I will never get this time wasted back!",2022-08-30
"Well this is a weird movie and useless.Like pretty much every TCM movies after the first one it brings nothing new.Its not you typical slasher movie, not boring only weird;Leatherface as been hiding in some ghost town with is mother and a few yuppies from the city coming claiming to have bought the whole town, there is an auction etc, a bunch of young yuppy kids.Is mother gets evicted and dies during transport to the hospital leatherface is in the van too, he gets mad and kills everyone.There is plenty of gore but the movie brings nothing new.",2022-02-21
"So I've never been to Texas but I believe when others say that they didn't shoot this in Texas. And hey why should they? Yes it is supposed to play there, but not to burst your bubble: movies are more often than not shot in entirely different locations than they actually appear to play at. I know: shocker (not).Pun I guess somewhat intended above. Now I know, just by simply being nice and because I actually enjoyed the romp and the mayhem (and the massacre - remember it is a movie, you can easily make that distinction here). One thing that even those who didn't like it can't take away from the movie: the level of violence in it. So no Texas, but yes to Massacre ... and way yes to Chainsaw. Although there are scenes with it in the movie that might make you cringe.The characters are not really likeable to say the least, the connection to the original is quite thin and most horror fans may not like the fact that our killer has a motive here. But there are also a lot of good things here, that you can find, if you look for them. Like the criticism of society and social media the I reckon already infamous bus scene involves.Special (and blood) effects are off the hook (something that I reckon is missing from the original)! Know what to expect, get exactly that and be entertained (otherwise you'll probably regret watching this).",2022-02-19
"This film start with a girl watching a video footage on the TV, and she buying things from a man scene! As turnout, this film is about two sisters(Melody, and Lila) need to survive from the killing of a mad guy ""Leatherface""! Entire film full of quite intense action scene! Such as, bloody gore scene, shooting scene, stabbing scene, sawing scene, car crash scene, and things broken scene! Make the film quite watchable! At the end, Melody been grabbed, and killed! Lila escape from her car at the very end! Still have a post credit scene! Leatherface walk back to his home! That's it! A quite entertain film!",2022-02-21
"I enjoyed the first 45-60 minutes. I don't remember any of the characters' names, and the story building throughout was pretty poor. It was an enjoyable enough flick for what it was, as I enjoy seeing a remake every once in a while. If you are a fan of the franchise, watch it for what it is and try not to critique too much. A 4 star rating might be low, but I see a lot of room for improvement. The acting in the film wasn't bad, just other areas lacking. Kind Regards!",2022-02-18
"I understand the idea of bringing Chainsaw to a new generation, since the protagonists of the film are obviously Gen Z, and I honestly liked that they added the complexity of the young people being wealthy influencers who were gentrifying a small town and kicked some sick old lady out of her home rather than making them seem completely innocent or good.On the other hand, Leatherface would be about 70-75 years old in this rehash. There's no way he would have passed as a 75-80 year old woman's ""boy"" (she certainly didn't look 100 to me despite her illness she seemed no older than eighty-ish).Furthermore, he was an intellectually disabled and emotionally disturbed child of an abusive family who ate human flesh...and suddenly he found a benevolent caretaker and just up and changed his ways? Without a fight from dad or brothers, while he was still young enough to be ""saved""? Not that someone who is already a serial killer could be saved even if he was in his early 20s in 1973.This is so bad, from the idea of making this a linear timeline to this guy being the original Leatherface and not ""Son of Leatherface"" or something along those lines, to the fact that the film looks and acts like most mainstream slasher trash from the '00s while the original TCM from 1974 was a literal work of cinematic art.",2022-11-29
"""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" 2022 is a fast paced, and bloody horror film that ends up being one of the better films in the series. Even if it doesn't do a whole lot new.Let me start off with the good. The gore in this movie is great. It's a very bloody movie. The kills are great, and inventive. I was very pleased with the carnage candy. The movies well shot and well directed. The performances for the most part are fairly good. Mainly the two leads, they worked off each other very well. I also thought the movie was very fast paced. It's a quick 83 minutes , and it's hardly ever boring. Leatherface is portrayed very well here. I like the look of him, it was very good. And finally I felt that the plot and the whole reason as to why leatherface is killing again was actually kinda believable.Now this isn't a great movie and the flaws I have are most of the characters here are either dull, or unlikable. I really couldn't get behind everyone in this movie. I felt that the inclusion of Sally Hardesty was rather pointless. She wasn't really in the movie that much and she didn't really add a whole lot. They also bring in a touchy subject about school shootings with the main character and I felt that could've added something but they didn't really explore it that much. And finally this movie didn't do a whole lot new to the series and it just felt like another Texas chainsaw movie.Overall despite a weak story, and some missed opportunities, ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" 2022 is a step up from other installments and features great gore, some good acting, and quick pacing.",2022-02-18
If you were a fan of slasher movies this is definitely a must see. It will not disappoint. Lots of gore great cinematography and a cool storyline following the original Texas chainsaw massacre. Don't believe the reviews. It's not bad at all for a slasher film.,2022-04-27
"I was around and not to young to watch the original. I'm a big fan of all horror and it's subgenres. This franchise is one of my favorites. There are some stinkers in the franchise but there are some pretty good releases too. TCM2 was pretty well done and had a good cast, you gotta love the scene when Hopper buys and tests out the chainsaws, and Mosley's visit to KOKLA is a gas. In my opinion the 2013 release Texas Chainsaw 3D is probably one of the better retellings.I found this retelling entertaining. At my age I've learned to appreciate retellings, reboots, remakes etc. I go into them openminded and hope to be entertained. This one wasn't the best but it's not nearly as bad as TCM TNG.One neat thing (which I guess makes this a spoiler) is at about 28:32 when the smoker is opened you hear the sound of a flashbulb instead of a ""squeak"" like one might expect when a smoker lid is raised. The sounds of the flashbulbs at the beginning of the original TCM are very memorable and I thought this was a pretty cool nod to the original.Very glad to hear Larroquette do the opening narrative. Amazing how many people don't know he did the opening narrative of the original TCM.You could pick away at this one like many of the others in the franchise, but I ask; Why would one do that? Kudos to the entire staff, crew, and actors for this release. They did a good job with the given content - made the story theirs but maintained just enough of the original story to catch the eye of us old timers and hopefully steer the younger crowd to investing the time to watch all of the releases. Maybe even inspire someone to create their own retelling!Matter of fact - think I'll watch TCM3D right now. Here you have the Sawyer/Carson faction instead of the Sawyer/Hewitt conflict.Cheers!",2022-02-18
"I liked the pacing but I think with a little more development it could've been taken to the next level. Lots of ideas stripped down into a slick, quick story. The kill scenes were effective. The bus scene being the most brutal. I kinda dug the ""revamp the town"" angle of the film, however they didnt go into the specifics that much. What was that ending though? Leatherface was silent the entire time as well. Not really as animated as the prior films.",2022-02-18
"I rarely find myself bored during a horror film and that's where I was here. The storyline was just extremely flat and the character development was slim to none. Everything was so rushed, it almost felt like a joke. The little town set up felt like a knock off of 2005's house of wax... the two scenes that were great and the reason it got 4 stars are the initial police van scene, and the bus scene... other then that... extremely let down.",2022-02-18
"I had a lot of fun with this movie! Nice to see some of the Horror franchises are still kicking along like Halloween, Scream and now Texas Chainsaw Massacre.This movie is exactly what you expect it to be. Basic storyline and paper thin characters, but what else to do you expect from a TCM sequel? Switch your brain off, grab your popcorn, sit back and enjoy the macabre new chapter in Leatherface's story. **Warning** You will need a strong stomach for some of the gory kills.",2022-02-19
"It's just a sad excuse for a Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The original is and remains to be the best out of all of the following movies they attempted making.The characters in this movie are stupid and the remaining two girls at the end are the ones I wanted to be killed as early as possible.I especially laughed hard at the idiotic end where they put their electric car on auto with a destination back to Austin with the little girl screaming while her stupid sister or whatever got dragged out of her seat and had her head chopped off while she watched from the top of her sunroof.I thought to myself, that's the three stars I'm gonna give this movie, atleast Leatherface still lives on.But do I have hope for a better movie in the future? ... Nope!You shouldn't be cheering on the bad guy, but he really had a good reason this time around to slaughter them all.",2023-08-28
"This may be the ninth instalment in the franchise, a direct sequel to the original, but it is slightly confusing when a few of them have similar titles (The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003), and Texas Chainsaw 3D); I had no doubt this was likely to be bad. Basically, it has been forty-eight years since the horrific events near Newt, Muerto County, Texas, and the disappearance of serial killer Leatherface. Young entrepreneurs Melody (Sarah Yarkin) and Dante (Jacob Latimore), Melody's sister Lila (Eighth Grade's Elsie Fisher) and Dante's girlfriend Ruth (Nell Hudson) travel from San Francisco to the abandoned Texas town of Harlow. They are auctioning old properties to create a trendy, heavily renovated area. While inspecting a rundown orphanage, the group discover there is an elderly woman called Virginia ""Ginny"" McCumber (Alice Krige) living there. She claims she has papers proving she still owns the property, but an argument breaks out, briefly interrupted by a silent and towering man (Mark Burnham) from upstairs. Suddenly, Ginny collapses from a heart attack and is rushed to the hospital, accompanied by Ruth and the man. Melody and Dante are distracted by an investor, Catherine (Jessica Allain), and a group of potential buyers arriving in a large bus. Meanwhile, Lila befriends local mechanic Richter (Moe Dunford), and reveals she survived a school shooting, leaving her terrified of guns. Ginny dies on the way to the hospital; Ruth texts Melody before the man goes berserk and murders the officers driving the ambulance, causing it to crash. When Ruth wakes up, she sees the man cutting off Ginny's face to wear as a mask, revealing himself to be Leatherface. Ruth manages to radio for help before Leatherface kills her, then he makes his way back to Harlow. During a property auction, Melody reads Ruth's texts and prepares to leave with Lila. Richter overhears them talking about Ginny's death, he takes their keys, wanting them to provide proof they legally removed Ginny from her home. Melody and Dante return to the orphanage to find them. Sally Hardesty (Olwen Fouéré), the sole survivor of the 1973 killings has become a hardened Texas Ranger; she learns of the recent attacks and heads out to investigate. At the orphanage, Melody discovers the papers and realises that Ginny was wrongfully evicted. Leatherface arrives at the orphanage and mutilates Dante with a meat cleaver. While Melody is hiding in the bedroom, Leatherface enters and retrieves his chainsaw. As night falls, a thunderstorm hits Harlow, and Catherine and Lila hide in the bus with the buyers. Dante stumbles out still out and is discovered by Richter before bleeding to death. Richter enters the orphanage and is attacked and killed by Leatherface. Melody retrieves keys from Richet's body before fleeing the house and reunites with Lila. They get on the bus, pursued by Leatherface who slaughters everyone aboard, including Catherine. Melody and Lila escape the carnage and find Sally who locks them in her car before entering the orphanage to finally confront Leatherface. She holds him at gunpoint, but when she speaks to him, he remains silent before walking away. Leatherface then attacks the sisters in Sally's car but Sally rescues them and shoots him. Sally gives Melody the car keys, then Leatherface ambushes and kills Sally. Melody hits Leatherface with Sally's car before crashing into a nearby building. Melody is trapped and tells Lila to run. When Leatherface appears, Melody apologises for what happened to Ginny. As he prepares to attack, Lila tries to shoot him, but her gun is empty. Sally shoots him instead and he flees. Before Sally dies, she encourages Lila not to run as she will be forever haunted by him as she was. Lila then takes Sally's shotgun and follows Leatherface into an abandoned building where she is ambushed and attacked. Melody arrives and takes Leatherface's chainsaw, using it to knock him into a pool of water where he sinks to the bottom. They escape and Lila puts on Sally's hate before starting to drive home as morning approaches. But as Lila drives away, she watches as Leatherface emerges, still alive. He drags Melody out onto the road before decapitating her with his chainsaw. Leatherface dances in the road with his chainsaw and clutches Melody's head. Also starring William Hope as Sheriff Hathaway, Jolyon Coy as Deputy, Sam Douglas as Herb the Proprietor, and the voice of John Larroquette as the Narrator. The performances of Fisher, Krige and others are fine, and the death sequences and gory effects, with faces slashed and heads decapitated, are suitably grisly, but the film lacks any real shocks, a silly script and is mostly boring, certainly one of the weakest of the sequels and I think the series has been done to death (maybe a pun intended), a naff slasher horror. Adequate!",2023-07-04
"Trying to revitalize the town, a group of influencers attempting to modernize a dying Texas town finds the area is the home to a chainsaw-wielding maniac who terrorized the community years earlier who has snapped after the death of his mother and is now turning his fury on their friends.Overall, there's a lot to like and dislike with this one. The main aspect that really wins this one over is the startling strong and brutal gore from the kills on display. There's quite a lot to like here with the series of shock ambushes involved throughout the film including all manner of scenes where he appears out of nowhere and viciously stabs, slices, or impales victims with numerous types of sharp objects. The brutality inherent in these scenes not only manages to make this one inherently graphic with some enjoyable over-the-top splatter and bloodshed but also some fun action here including the police transport crash that sets everything in motion, the house attack including a spectacular brawl with one of the victims and the absolute delight of the bus attack which is the centerpiece sequence in the entire franchise as a whole. As it all looks impressive and happens to those that deserve it, this becomes all the more enjoyable, plus as well as the rather fun pace that keeps this moving at a fantastic tempo it all becomes quite likable in that regard. However, beyond this factor, there's not much to like with this one. Among the bigger flaws is the highly underwhelming storyline that doesn't make any sense or make the characters likable. Going through such a massive timeline shift that tries to tie into the events from nearly half a century earlier means that the appearance of characters and events from the original should match up which obviously doesn't work as all sorts of inconsistencies arrive from this factor. The inclusion of the character from the original is entirely meaningless with how they're handled here which is the start of the historical inaccuracies present here that range not just from the treatment of historical facts but also the presentation of the characters. It's impossible to believe the returning characters are anything close to the same people from the original due to their behavior and treatment and it becomes highly irritating to see this transpire here. The other real issue to be had here is the absolutely banal and terrible third act that transpires to kill off nearly everything that the film had built up. The escape from the bus carnage signals the end of the fun here as the film manages to completely dishonor the main character from the original in a disrespectful manner which leads to an endless series of brawling and chasing around the community that's utterly ridiculous to see play out. Seeing all the contrivances and excuses required to showcase how these girls are able to not only stand up to but survive a battle against the hulking behemoth of a killer interacting with them that goes on far longer than natural confrontations would provide and feels more pointless than cathartic. It's almost as pointless as the early setup and storylines brought up here that hold this up, from the reason behind their investments in the town to the guilty conscious behind everything that happens and the utterly atrocious politically-correct dialog throughout here about who they and their friends are which all bring this one down overall.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",2022-05-23
"Just watched this on Netflix. Obviously set in Texas but filmed in Bulgaria I make this the ninth movie in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series. Leatherface is back, along with Sally Hardesty, sole survivor of the first movie (Marilyn Burns died in 2014 so obviously the part is played by a different actress). This movie is very gory and as slasher movies go it's fast paced and enjoyable but does the world need anymore TCM movies? I think not. One of the best moments has Leatherface board a party bus, everyone gets out their mobile phones to photograph him, not realising they are all about to be sawed to death! TCM part 2 was very good but there's only one great movie in the franchise and that's the 1974 original. I couldn't really take to the lead characters, two young sisters, and the action is often very over the top. Will we see any more TCM movies? I'd be very surprised if we don't.",2022-02-18
Writers make you feel and act stupid because you invested time and internet in seeing such a cool franchise; only to F you in your A with terrible written storyline and backstory leading to this atrocity that they call a new and newly embellished-written sagaDo not recommend; stay away. Save your money.,2022-02-19
"I'm blown away. The gore, the kills, Leatherface, the chararacters and storyline worked out surprisingly perfect because I had never expected this after Legendary sold the film to Netflix. As a hard core TCM fan, I feel so proud and full.Everything was explained and told perfectly and the camera angles were so brave and fresh. Loved how they took the courage with everything and it was all well done.",2022-02-18
3 out of 5 starsTexas Chainsaw Massacre is a fair slasher film that follows after the events of the original movie that came out in 1973. Leatherface is hiding in a empty town. Which a group of young adults are visiting and looking to invest in real estate property to bring the town to life. Only to discover Leatherface who starts terrorizing them.Good about the film? It is kind of a nice start and fresh sequel erasing the many sequels and even remakes. Like Halloween or Terminator did. The film is thrilling and fast paced. The film does focus on two girls Melody (Sarah Yarkin) and Lila (Elsie Fisher) who are anti guns. And suffered a terrible past. Sally ( Olwen Fouere) is the survivor from the original film and is back when she discovers Leatherface is still alive.The film does offer some bloody thrills. And kills.Bad things about the film? The film's script and direction does make characters make stupid choices like any other horror films. Leatherface could have been killed easily but a character always hesitates and lets them walk away.The bus sequence with Leatherface walking in there with a group of adults partying. And they all pull out there phones to stream him is just cheesy and dumb. But does become a blood bath.The film is not terrible. It is entertaining and a fair sequel that could have been worse. The cast is decent. The thrills are exciting. But direction and script is cheesy and dumb.,2022-02-19
"As expected this movies had a really shallow story. There is a lot of gore and bodies piling up, but zero suspence or excitement. Its not really a horror movie in that sense, more of a gorefest. The production itself is however really good, with nice effects and classic rural texas environment. Well done productionwise.",2022-02-18
"This movie SUCKS!I was not expecting much but it's hard to vocalize how much this movie seems to have been written to tick you off even relative to the slasher movie genre in general. I'd love a good slasher; in concept they sound fun but the era of the slasher is OVER. I think I'd actually take Hereditary over this. But not Midsomar...What did I even watch...I think I've blocked a lot of it...It starts OKish. It's a generic slasher but that's not the worst thing you can be. At least it's not a trashy paranormal thing, right?... RIGHT?!Someone else has probably ranted about how it tried to make this about the eternal battle between the woke and the racist and how that has no place here. It's piggy backing off the success of both the Halloween Legacy sequels and off that Wrong Turn remake.It makes fun of the right people (on both sides) but a lot of it is sanctimonious and annoying because it does such a good job of showing annoying people and how the people condemning are just as obnoxious. There are really no sympathetic characters. In the quotes section I saw that ""That's a cult"" exchange and it's just not as clever as any of the writers thought it is. It is very contrived.Is this a sequel? I hate that it just uses the same title! Now there's three of them!I'm not quite sure where to fit this next part into the review but I hate that violins on chalkboard style music score they keep playing infrequently.One party defeats another party or survives strictly at the will of the writer. There is no impression of a world with its own internal rules.The third act...is just insulting. And the ending...uhgh...",2022-08-26

Don't watch this movie don't do it to yourself. Only movie I've ever rated 0/100. Me and my brother predicted every cliche possible before it even happened and every single character is as stupid as it gets.,2022-02-19
"What is it with filmmakers and their unending desire for dumb follow up movies which have no plot or meaning or motivation at all? See for e.g. Halloween Kills (braincells).Slasher films are certainly a thing of the past! What people want is a story that enwraps the audience and characters who are likable and to whom the audience can connect with.This film is carbon copy of Halloween Kills, no plot, unlikable characters who make dumb decisions and blood, lots of blood and gore and an ending which serves as a slap to the audience's face.",2022-02-19
"Don't think too much on this one. It's a straight-forward slasher you watch for a lot of gory kills. Sure the story is basic and the acting not oscarworthy. But it doesn't need to be. The kills are worthy of the title name. Plus the fact that it's a group of ""cancel culture"" & ""woke"" youngsters who get caught up here adds to the fun of the film, for people who enjoy these films like I do.",2022-02-19
"Worst horror movie ever, people are always stupid in horror movies, but this is next level stupidness.. wtf. I have never seen this many mistakes in any kind of movie. I really don't hope it was expensive to make cuz that was really sad to watch..
At least there was some fun to make out of all their bad mistakes.",2022-02-19
"This film really rubbed people the wrong way...and it's probably Netflix fault.The thing is...if you approach it as a one off slasher film, it could have flown with a few simple tweaks.For example, they shouldn't have marketed this leatherface as the original leatherface...having been shut in an orphanage, in a remote town in Texas, for the past 48 years.That would render him, at the very least...in his mid 70's...if not 80s. Which is completely implausible.All they really needed to do was to make this leatherface a descendant of the original leatherface, and they probably could have gotten away with it.You can chock this up to a lack of imagination.They then double down on that narrative with the Sally Hardesty character, as a retired officer who has been attempting to hunt leatherface down since the original massacre- their second mistake.Especially considering Marilyn Burns passed away in 2014, shortly after making a cameo appearance in the 2013 film.It's just bad tact...that was completely unnecessary.What makes things worse, is that the writing for the Hardesty character is absolutely atrocious.And there is just no way that after being smoked with a sledgehammer, slashed in the leg with a chainsaw, and impaled by an iron bar...that you would be able to walk...let alone wield a chainsaw effectively...like...come on!?!The sad part is, that eliminating these simple mistakes, would have left them with a relatively competent gore film.Because they waste no time getting into it...and there is quite a bit of gore.But you just can't overlook these glaring oversights of logic and a general sense of chronology.So it's no wonder that it left everyone pissed off.Because, really, it's completely inexcusable.I'm not entirely sure whose specifically to blame for this, but considering several writers were responsible for the script...it's almost certainly Netflix fault.An epic failure, that could have been something, at least, decent...if even the slightest bit of effort and imagination was put into it.3.5 out of 10.",2022-10-06
"I liked what it was trying to accomplish or the mood it set out to set. It was also engaging and though pales in comparison to the original like every movie in the series after it, was an entertaining watch considering other crap that comes out nowadays. It was brutal, and tense. My mom even liked it. A solid 7/10 stars. Who says a predictable movie can't be good? (I.e.: every Rom-Com ever made...)👍B+ for acting and direction
B+ for concept
F for bringing back Sally. (Sorry, that was the weakest pandering attribute of the film...)Thumbs up!Shawn Thornton.",2022-02-21
"Yes it was woke but in a strange way it backfired on the producers this time, every single actor other than the older sister showed you exactly why the world has changed so much and not for the better.

I really don't understand all the bad reviews for this one. For what's it's supposed to be it's actually done really well. I thought this was one of the better horror movies I've seen in a long time. Maybe the whole crowd didn't like it because of who they killed off first idk. All I'm saying is don't listen to the reviews. This was as good as I hoped it was. It's not a 10 but I had to even put all the bad reviews that are probably rating it off an agenda rather than the actual movie.,2022-02-21
"Defiantly not as bad as what I was expecting as watching the trailer I wasn't to impressed as was also learning about it's troubled production history didn't give me much hope either. As is it's good dumb fun for the most part. It tries to throw in a lot of modern issues which at times had me rolling my eyes and there's one line of dialogue on the bus scene which is so beyond freaking stupid and cringe that it almost derailed me from watching the whole thing in general.And I'll also do a hard pass on that ending as well, there's never been anything supernatural about Leatherface as far as I know so pulling that crap just doesn't work for me. Overall, it's very Halloween 2018 as people have said if that's ok with you then give it a go, but it's not anything worth a second watch.",2022-03-29
"This is the third sequel to the original and most similar to the first sequel but not as crazy so I prefer the original sequel but this is still entertaining. It is more like a slasher film than the original which is good. The pace is fantastic, there is not a boring moment. I would not necessarily agree with all the directorial decisions - most notably the massacre itself. Whilst I appreciate the massacre it felt rushed and not as violent or intense as it should have been, quite probably because the only joke in the film comes in this scene with the generation Z group vlogging the massacre. I also still find it strange that the best chainsaw violence comes in Dawn of the Dead (2004) and deleted scenes in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986). Other than that poor decision I would say that it is really well directed. Great production values, great first half, entertaining slasher, some inconsistent decisions in the latter half.",2022-02-24
"Literally waisted 1h30 of my life. They couldn't find a better name for this movie, it is indeed a massacre.Sally couldn't find a better opportunity to kill the guy with her shotgun but instead choses to ask him if he remembers her and then let's him walk away.. WALK-AWAY! He didn't even have to run and flee. This monstrosity of a movie could have ended right there but instead led to other stupid moments like that. The man gets shot 3 times in the abdomen, gets hit with a chainsaw in the head and is still walking in one piece...I am out of words to describe how incoherent that movie was.Strongly do not recommend to watch it!",2022-02-18
"After the really disappointing « Leatherface » in 2017, here's another one movie about our favorite one. This time billed as the true sequel to the original Tobe Hopper classic.

"The new reboot of the franchise doesn't do anything new in it and it feels like a waste. The story is just weak with it having little to offer and this isn't like Halloween 2018 movie. The whole auction an abandoned town that Leatherface lives in goes nowhere interesting and is nothing to talked about. It also really predictable throughout the runtime and is easily to guess what happened next. Also the plotline with Sally feels like a waste and is disappointing on how they treated it. The movie doesn't have any new development due to the runtime being too short. And the ending is really obvious.It does have a couple of decent suspenseful scenes in it, but it lacks the psychological horrors from the original movie.",2023-09-04
"Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a new film in the film series, which ignores the other films after the first film from 1974 and tries to come across as the only sequel. This film is directed by David Blue Garcia, who has previously directed only the film Tejano.In the film, a group of young people tries to turn a remote Texas town into a successful tourist attraction. What the youngsters do not know, however, is that this town was intended to shield its last inhabitant from the rest of the world. This last resident is the brutal and mysterious Leatherface (Mark Burnham), who was responsible for the massacre of fifty years ago.With this new Texas Chainsaw movie they try to imitate the success of the Halloween movie from 2018. So they try to go in their own new direction with this film and only bring back some familiar moments from the first film. With the Halloween movie, this worked out better, because people who had worked on the original movie came back for the new movie.Unfortunately, no people from the original film return with this new Texas Chainsaw film, so the new film crew has to come up with ideas and a good story almost single-handedly. Director David Blue Garcia and screenwriter Chris Thomas Devlin are also on the novice side in the film world and this is reflected in the quality of this film. Fede Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues also contributed to the story of this film and together they have a little more experience in the film world, but unfortunately not enough to make this film a unique or good sequel.Then the story can come across as a bit cliché, because the characters make many stupid mistakes without thinking logically, so you almost don't mind when Leatherface gets their hands on them. You also have to wait a long time before Leatherface comes into action, because after about fifty minutes in the film he really uses his well-known chainsaw.There are some entertaining scenes for slashers, but none better than in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre or the first sequel of this 1986 movie. For more entertainment and a better movie, try one of this movie or even the remake from 2003 looking back.",2022-02-19
"With any long running franchise, over time, it's no longer fair to expect to recapture the glory of the original. The best you can hope for are increasingly generic takes on classic characters that act as postcards from the era in which they're made. Like it or not, our current time period is exemplified through social media and social justice issues, and this will go down as the ""woke"" entry in the TCM series. While having a mixed race cast that doesn't objectify it's female characters does feel like positive progress, you also get moronic one liners like ""Try anything and you're cancelled, bro"" that will make you hate this generation. They pad the backstory with modern hot button issues like school shootings, gentrification and confederate flags, but like any horror movie, that all goes out the window once the carnage begins. Credit where credit's due, they certainly don't hold back on bloodshed, and if you showed up for a mindless killing rampage, then you've come to the right place. That bus slaughter sequence alone is worth the price of admission, which isn't much considering this went straight to Netflix. Of course it's not as subtly disturbing as the original, with next to none of the atmosphere usually found in the series, and the questionable decision to ditch the usual ""the whole town is in on it"" side plot. Without those details, Leatherface seems interchangeable with any other monster barrelling towards a group of teens. They attempt to tie things to the original film by including it's final girl, but given the original actress is no longer with us to reprise the role, it feels pretty shallow and it's ultimately a useless detour. Come for the massacre, expect little else, isn't that all you can ask of a Texas Chainsaw movie really?",2022-02-22
Who doesn't like watching a bunch of woke hipsters get slaughtered by a maniac wearing an old ladies face as a skin mask. I know I did. I'm sure a lot of people are going to criticize this film. I'll admit it was tacky at times. But who cares. It was still fun to see Leatherface ripping people to shreds again. In the end that's all that really matters. 6 stars.,2022-02-25

"The original Tobe Hooper classic is almost universally beloved by horror fans but unlike say 'Halloween' or 'Nightmare on Elm Street' the results were mixed when 'Chainsaw' became a series. Every sequel/remake/reboot has been in the shadow of the original and it's hard to love 'Chainsaw' as a mythology. Every sequel has had to reinvent the formula and the only one to really work well was Tobe Hooper's 2 which was the most radically different. This 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' really doesn't know what it is or what it has to say.It feels almost soulless and mass processed through a warped lens of horror and pop culture. It borrows a lot from David Gordon Green's 'Halloween' despite the fact that Michael Myers and Leatherface are radically different characters. It is a movie that goes broad and tosses out buzz concepts like ""gentrification"", ""cancel culture"", and ""PTSD"" but it has nothing to say about these things. Leatherface just comes out of nowhere and slashes his way away and expects the audience to forget that he must be close to eighty years old by now. You see the world has changed since 1974 but Leatherface is more of the same.Despite the misguided ambitions of the script this 'Texas Chainsaw' looks great. It is a very spooky and atmospheric looking film and I think that had Director David Blue Garcia had a better script to work with this could have been something special. The problem with this film and series is that they take the title on face value. 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' as a title sort of challenges you to go all in full force with the gore. You forget that the original is often an understated film with a lot of quiet moments that linger on unsettling imagery. Tobe Hooper knew he was making something good and that with that exploitative title the audience would fill in the banks. Leatherface was never scarier than in the scene where he moans and cries by himself in the room full of skeleton trophies.Leatherface will never die and this certainly isn't the worst film he's appeared in. It's merely forgettable which I guess is an improvement over 'Texas Chainsaw 3D'",2022-03-31
"This movie is hands down the BIGGEST let down ever, they have soooo many plot holes its insane, Blond goes in the van? WHY whats she gonna do?, On SPOILER ALERT, the cops dead next to her and she climbs over him after crying for help instead of taking his gun with his back tunred and and popping off on him?, Then the rest of the plot holes the list goes on at this point its not even worth talking about hands down one of the worst IF NOT THE WORST horror movie iv ever seen in my life.",2022-02-19
"As a horror geek, to be honest I was not expecting much. But it could be better definitely. I don't like it when killers are intouchable. In a car, with two police officers; in a bus full of people... And yet nobody can stop him. I really don't think it's possible or that easy to break somebody's arm like that, in the car scene. So many times the old lady, Sally, could have killed him, especially in the house. I can count more, but it's enough. You may enjoy it with your friends, without questioning.",2022-02-19
"The person who arguable deserved to die the most lasted the longest, which I thought was pretty lame. The first half is cool but then it devolves into the ridiculous. Marilyn would probably not be happy with how her character was treated in this movie. Overall not bad but could have been a lot more with a different plot and new characters.",2022-02-19
"Another failure. Please just stop with the remakes. They all follow the same damn plot anyway. Stupid teens, their need to force modern times ideas on everyone, an overpowered murderer with the original movies being the only backstory filmmakers could come up with, and ofcourse a surviving character waiting half a century to kill the guy, same thing with Halloween and Scream.Can't you just invest in some quality scripts ffs.",2022-02-22

The best in all of Texas Chainsaw movies.",2022-02-20
"Lacks the sweaty, gritty, grimness of the original. Some great action and plenty of blood. A mixed bag of characters and a muddled story. Some of the irritating support players are reminiscent of the 90s stylised horrors- shallow and annoying. In a time when too often films are way too long, this could do with being longer to unpick some of the plot, which largely goes by unresolved or short on detail. Watched it three times on the day of release as I'd been looking forward to it since first announced. A fun and funny addition, that delivers on the gore. Lower expectations and enjoy the entertainment.",2022-02-18

"First of all started with rude girl , second they was in gas station putting gasoline in electrical Tesla car work in battery and the more stupid thing is they drive it 7 hours to a Town in the middle of nowhere. More of that they have iPhones and internet and when all this drama start no one thinks to use the phone for call the police but they was using it for Instagram live!! And that black women actor she saw that black man dying she didn't even think to call emergency because in this movie the emergency is not exist and she keeps staring at him and comeback to the bus and she didn't tell anyone what happened!! What in the world is this stupidity
at the end this woman from the part one move she followed him to the house and she keeps staring at him and ask him if you remember her but he didn't care and he go out then she go down and shoot him and he didn't die he go and kill her very easy
, how they can waste our time and money to produce something seriously bad , what's wrong Netflix!QUICK MESSAGE IF YOU WANNA WATCH THIS MOVIE IS OK WATCH IT IS YOUR CHOICE BUT I YOU GONNA WASTE YOUR TIME BECAUSE IS VERY DUMB IS VERY STUPID MOVIE.",2022-02-19

"I'm surprised by how many good reviews I'm seeing - As a fan of the series, I hated this movie. For one thing, retconning a classic like Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is heresy! - But even ignoring that, the tone of this film is all wrong for a Texas Chainsaw Massacre film - a ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" with no Sawyer Family or ""dinner scene"" is just another slasher film. I mean, there isn't even a single mention of cannibalism in this movie! Leatherface's mask looked all wrong, too. Probably the worse Leatherface mask I've seen. Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2022) is a run of the mill horror movie and an absolutely terrible sequel to original.",2022-02-18
Just horrible! I can't believe I spent 1.30 hour of my time for this. A very cheap production and really bad acting! Not sure how they managed to sold this to Netflix! Please do not waste your time by watching this!,2022-02-27
"I really enjoyed the new creative storyline added to this new addition to the franchise.Before in the past it was always centred on the same plot where a group of friends gets lost or stuck n killed off But this time their was a new surprise in the storyline.I really liked how they gave nods to real social world problems like a brief nod towards school gun violence as well as survivors guilt, i also enjoyed the incorporation of social media in this film as it makes it more realistic to the current trends we see in daily life.The reactions for the most part seems more logical too match real life expectations of how the characters should react in their situations.Although their were acouple questionables scenes where the reactions were kinda ridiculous.Without revealing the scene basically their was a certain situation that requires escaping and they acted all stupid & trapped but then after awhile they suddenly regain logical sense n finally reacts like how actual people would act.Also im sorry but Sarah yarkin looks so middle eastern n yet shes sisters with a white girl n i duno it just seemed weird for them to write them as sisters n not step sisters.Mainly though online labels her white but Its too glaring how thick Sarah Yarkins Eyebrows are its like matching how arabics look.Honestly it bothered me alot how bushy her eyebrows were lol, like it looks like both eyebrows are fighting to become 1 as a unibrow so thats what really puts me off about this film as well i never liked her acting either as its always one dimensional.Anyway i rated this a 6/10 because i just felt the story is too rushed, not enough development into each character that it didnt seem too matter to me personally which ever character dies.I remember checking how much time is left in the movie when it showed im half way and i thought wow this movie provided so little information on each character with so much time already passed by.The killing scenes were very well done as well as the aesthetics n props to make it look so good.The actors were all average honestly But i do respect their choice in trying to use no name actor/actresses to save money on production as well as its easier to get involved in a story with less famous people.",2022-02-19
Boring and idiotic. It adds nothing new. What you see is done a 1000 times over. This was a completely unnecessary production with no value what so ever. I almost dozed off during the screening of this thing.,2022-04-06
This might of been the worst horror movie iv ever seen. The first 30 minutes is jam packed with so much liberal political bs that i almost puked. If i could rate it 0/10 i would but ill give it a 1 since it had 2 cool death scenes by far the worst movie in the franchise stay away if you have the chance wish i wouldn't of wasted my time.,2022-02-19
The story seemed cut short. Although. It helped the movie. If you go into this with low expectations. You'll still be disappointed. The ending is great. That probably made it watchable. Let's face it. The first one should have never had any sequels or reboots made. Worth a watch for diehard horror fans.,2022-02-19

"Some chefs aparently now own half of Texas including the town of Harlow. They plan an auction to sell the everything in the town. The two kids, a girlfriend of one of them, the sister of the other travel to Harlow, and of course quickly run into them creepy Texans. The guy who runs the gas station who sells all sorts of Texas Chainsaw Massacre memorabilia and some guy who arrives to fill his truck with gas. He carries a gun (the horror!). THe are also stopped by the Sherrif. The kids outragraged drive away and arrive in a deserted Harlow. The lady who runs the orphanage is still inhabiting her house. When the kids try to kick her out she starts having a heart-attack. Her remaining orphan is none of other than soon-to-be-again Leatherface.The woman dies on the way to the hospital in the cop's van. For some reason the kid's girlfriend is riding along for no reason other than to be one Leatherface's early victim. With the woman dead, Leatherface freaks out, attacks everyone in the van which causes them to crash. He drags the woman out of the van and proceeds to make his mask with her face. Then he kills everyone injured in the van.Back in the town, the investors arrive for the auction by bus. Sister who is a traumatized high-school shooting survivor warms up to truck guy. Eventually, Leatherface arrives in town as it becomes night, finds his chainsaw and starts dispatching people there culminating in a massacre in the bus where all the investors have fled.We also meet the survivor from the very first movie, Sally, who has been looking for Leatherface all her life. She picks up an emergency call and makes it to the town to at last face Leatherface together with the two sisters.TCM 2022 is a refreshingly short at 1:14 hours, somewhat uninspired, but efficient gory horror movie. It doesn't bother to give us any compelling characters let alone a sympathetic charismatic lead. The cast rather is bizarre in its utter lack of appeal. And it took 4 casting directors for this. Without someone to root for, things quickly fall flat. Not even Leatherface is particularly menacing as people usually place themselves in a position to become a victim. The movie worth watching but it's nothing special.",2022-02-20

"After what seemed like an eternity for this to be released, I have to admit I wasn't expecting much. The last film I enjoyed in this franchise was The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning (2006). I could not stand the 2013 reboot at all and the Leatherface prequel in 2017 wasn't much better. So as I stated, I had low expectations.This film exceeded them in almost every way. I didn't hate these main characters. They didn't feel like they were just here to die, even though it's pretty obvious that the majority of them are. They tried to do something different with the plot that didn't retcon the original and still builds upon it. The gore did not disappoint; this film is BRUTAL. Leatherface hasn't felt this menacing in a long time. The characters try to fight and do the smart thing more times than not and I was very pleased with that. There were some very good moments of tension in here that kept me guessing what would happen next. The plot, at least for me, wasn't predictable from beginning to end and that left me very satisfied.My only complaints after one viewing -It's pretty obvious that they were influenced to bring Sally Hardesty back because of Halloween (2018). But man, did they do her DIRTY! She didn't have much character work to do throughout the film and came off a bit static, as she only had maybe a little over 10 minutes of screen time, but I still cared for her deeply. Her death scene left me feeling disjointed... not because I was angry that she died, but it felt a little disrespectful. I didn't know if I was expecting her to survive or not, but I don't think it was a proper sendoff. It definitely could have been worse, though. Had the late Marilyn Burns still been with us and reprised the role herself, I may feel differently about this. It would have felt much more iconic. Olwen Fouéré does a phenomenal job with the material she was given, however. Mad props to her for still bringing the role to life. Also, I wish that Dante, Ruth, Richter, and Catherine had been fleshed out a little bit more, because this whole cast gave some great performances! I felt bad for characters when they died, especially Ruth. Had this film been 15-20 minutes longer, there could definitely have been some more characterization.I do recommend this film to fans of the franchise. I haven't had this much fun in a chainsaw film in almost 16 years. Give it a watch!",2022-02-21
"I adore atone Hoopers original movie. This isn't anywhere near as good but for 90 minutes you're entertained and it's full of gore. Leatherface is justified in being upset and wanting to take revenge after the events early on in the movie. Some good scenes, some suspense and a nice callback with a familiar face returning.",2022-02-20

"Tobe Hooper's 1974 masterpiece is one of the few films to actually terrify me growing up, and it's also one of my all time favorite horror movies. When I saw the trailer for this I was really hoping they would do it some honor and justice by recreating a great classic... they didn't.If you find a low budget over the top gore short film made by an independent filmmaker with no money on YouTube. Watch it instead of this. Not only will you be supporting a filmmaker trying to make they're way, the short film will probably be better than this movie.No suspense, no build on the character, no suffering or tension in their torment. Just people getting sliced, diced, and mushed. Nobody dies on the first shot either, they all miraculously live long enough to die... again. Obviously leatherface is super human as well. He can take shots from a gun, be stabbed, hit by a car, and keep going. Not to mention he apparently can cover great distances on foot in an incredibly short amount of time.The dialogue is awful, the acting is bad, and the movie is just a disgrace to the original masterpiece.",2022-02-23

This is no where near as good as the original but it luckily does not try to be either. It is a continuation of this franchise that offers the same gruesome kills set in modern times. It pokes fun at the generation z to show how narcissistic they can be.Most of the cast are forgettable & therefore the viewer cannot invest in caring about them. Let alone amounting them to nothing more than numbers in a kill count.,2022-02-20
Even worse than The Next Generation. It's about on par with Halloween II (the Rob Zombie version). Just an awful movie. I went into this movie with below 0 expectations but still that was too high!

Everything about this film is just utterly horrendous. The characters are very unlikeable (that's me being kind) and the new Leatherface is just dire. There is nothing good about this film at all. Being forced to stretch this review out due to the 600 character count.....Bringing back the original girl was also poorly executed as she like the rest of the cast was very 1 dimensional but also not a believable character in the slightest. Also the kills were very boring despite the best efforts to make them more brutal and gory I was left feeling just meh.Again it's just an utter travesty of a bad film.,2022-08-28
"The 9th installment in the long running Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise finally released on Netflix last month and I must admit this one is one of the worst in the franchise. The film is a direct sequel to the 1974 original and tries to emulate the success that the Halloween revival has seen (bring back a character from the original to fight the man with the mask).Almost 50 years have passed since the events of the original. A group of entrepreneurs travel to the town of Harlow to auction off old properties. But they have to face Leatherface's wrath as he goes on a rampage after his caretaker dies. And yes, Sally Hardesty, the sole survivor from 1973 returns to kill Leatherface for good.The worst part about this sequel is the inclusion of Sally Hardesty's character. In the process of copying what Halloween did, they ruin her return as well. The fans of the series have long forgotten the original and Sally wasn't even a memorable character for viewers to cheer her dramatic return. The film also fails to explain what happened to Leatherface after the events of 1973; which makes this work more like a standalone film.The cast includes Eighth Grade standout, Elsie Fisher, Sarah Yarkin, Moe Dunford, Jacob Latimore, Nell Hudson & Mark Burnham as Leatherface.Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a dead franchise. There is no point in reviving it even if you have the most innovative kills in your pocket. The post-credit sequence either teases Leatherface's retirement or another entry in the franchise.",2022-03-08
"Bottom line: This was not worth it, and I wish I hadn't picked it. The setup is pretty good, and the quality drops quickly after that.This is a big miss for me and I was torn between 3-4/10. I bumped it down because the end was super lame and dragged on.The setup is pretty good: They don't waste a lot of time, they introduce everyone, and then get right into it. They give just enough info to keep things moving, except they're way too vague about the main character's reason for being there. Some kind of special gentrification auction with a poorly defined group of investors showing up in a party bus? They cold have just been less vague and given any number of simple/clear explanations for it. I kept thinking something more would come out about it because it seemed vague for a reason, but they just never bother with it.Some of the early killings are great and I was excited about the movie, but then they just felt like they wanted as many deaths as possible as fast as possible to get to the end of the movie. Almost like they gave up or cut a handful of scenes. It felt like an excuse to just pack in gore, but the gore wasn't even that crazy.Most of the characters just aren't good. You don't really get enough to care about any of them before they die. Most of them you never even see on screen until they die, which is an awkward choice. The ones you meet are just lame and flat.The biggest problem for me is the way the characters act. No one tells anyone what's going on, even when asked directly with plenty of spare time. They are just silent or vague for no reason. Everyone just lets people die without any real effort to warn them. No one outside of the main characters even attempt to run away, they just stand there screaming in large groups.By the end of the movie the scenes are just boring and frustrating with the way people act and the actions they choose to take (or not take). The end dragged on as well, I was surprised at the low runtime when I checked afterwards. It struck me as odd that Leatherface was supposed to be 50 years older than the first incidents, but he looked like a strong 40 year old and they didn't try to age him in any way.",2022-10-08

"Could have been so much better but not as bad as everybody says. Despite its stupid ending, I liked the story, it's quite new and does justice to the franchise with lots of gore and unthinkable violence.Everyone refers to the bus scene as the highlight of the film and yes, it's ironically brutal.On the other hand, for the first time we witness the humane side of Leatherface, albeit slightly, which is uncommon among psychopathic killers who lack any kind of emotions.And after all, what do you expect? This is the Texas Chainsaw Massacre!",2022-02-22
"Going in, I didn't expect a masterpiece from this movie. I didn't even expect it to be good. Even then, my expectations were set too high. From a filmmaking perspective, I found this movie fascinating. How did this get made?! The script is absolutely terrible. It feels like a first draft of a writer's first screenplay. The characters and their ""arcs"" are so shallow and weak, why even bother with them? The original got that right, along with many things that this one failed at. Less is more. The concept alone is bizarre, a setup poorly thrown together simply to allow for a big dumb horror action scene, ""Halloween Kills"" style. The annoying characters apparently want to reignite the flame of a small Texas town that has been all but abandoned with the help of a busload of investors who exist simply to die. The characters are so poorly written that they sometimes come off as satirical (minus the attempt for real satire in the climax, which comes off as stupid). The reactions and decisions that they make are beyond dumb horror character decisions, they are often downright insane. Not that they had much to work with, but the actors certainly didn't elevate the material. Olwen Fouréré's performance is something straight out of a new Bruce Willis movie. Besides being stupid, not scary, and just an overall bad movie, it is incredibly distasteful and insulting. One of the characters (I've already forgotten their names) survived a school shooting. She then uses this as inspiration to take down Leatherface as he slices and dices through 30+ people. Horrific real life violence, especially that of school shootings, has absolutely no place in a big dumb horror movie like this. This is the type of movie that makes you cheer for the slasher villain, throwing in references to real life horror is insulting. I do have to compliment the filmmakers on the cinematography of the film, which is well done. That's all. Coming from someone who has seen every Texas Chainsaw installment, don't watch this movie. 0/10.",2022-02-19
"I've never seen so many dumb people in a movie like this one . Not to mention the absolutely pathetic script. In the end I was cheering for leatherface, because so many stupid people really deserve to die. Too bad. Rate 4.0 for bloody death scenes.",2022-02-20
"There are reviews saying it ""disrespects the original."" Uh... have you seen any of the other seven or so films in this disconnected series. Yes, the original TCM is a classic of the genre, never to be topped. This is not the first sequel/remake/reboot. It's a slasher film. There is slashing. And... there's actually a ""chainsaw massacre,"" which can't be said for any of the others, including the original. Bad acting? It's serviceable and what is expected for this type of film. At its brief running time, it gets to what you're really wanting in a film with ""massacre"" in the title: Gore; Lots of it and it's done really well. This is a horror slasher and not deserving of the derision with which it's being assaulted. It's no classic. But it's entertaining and delivers the goods that other films of its ilk do not. Give it a chance.",2022-02-28
"I appreciated this one more than I thought I would. It was equally interesting and dumb. I tend to expect myself to question much of the writing from almost every horror remake that comes out. This was no different, yet it was still entertaining and enjoyable at least. It's a modern take sequel as if there weren't any and felt somewhat relevant. The kills were great and the gore wasn't too over the top. My favorite still remains Marcus Nispel's though, as that cinemtography and score still lingers in my mind. I have yet to watch the John Luessenhop take. I met the late great Gunnar Hansen in 2003 and I honestly didn't appreciate that moment as much then as the years to come.",2022-12-15
"For someone who actually enjoys horror movies and the story behind them this has to be hands down the worst horror we have seen in years,The story is so terrible and the acting in scenes is borderline cringe. The only thing horror about this movie is the acting and the thought process behind the story line.If I could rate this a 0 I would and even that is pushing it.

"There's been so many TCM films in the past so expectations weren't high. The characters lack depth, I couldn't list their names but boy, the killings make up for that.City folk traumatise a old woman out her house saying they own it, cue a trip to hospital, her son accompanying her on the trip. She croaks, he goes full Leatherface on everyone. Death, murder, decapitation, it's all here! The last 30 seconds of the film got me good. Not a film that'll win Oscar lol, but it's a pretty good horror.",2022-02-18

"This is a direct sequel to the 1970's original that tried to shoe horn so much stuff in, it doesn't make any sense. The plot is weak, the characters are very flat and the multiple cultural points and odd character call back do not hit the mark. However, if you want to turn off your brain and enjoy some gore, it will fulfill that need. Recommended if bored and you have whiskey.",2022-02-19

"I understand the idea that it's easier to launch an idea based on one that proved lucrative before. I am a diehard Gunnar Hansen Tobe Hooper TCM fan. All the others that came after (except the Jessica Biel one that kept to the Original plot and was well done) have been no good. This might be the 2nd worse next to the Renee/Mathew lump that came out. This film has nothing in common with the greatness of the original film. I heard the premise of Sally returning and thought it was a good one. It falls flat on every level. The Leatherface is terrible, anemic looking, they never shrunk Micheal Myers or Jason from what I recall. The sally character has no presence, her reveal looks they tried to make it interesting. It wasn't. Less interesting then Leatherfaces entrance. Then the bus load of millennials that could have been done well, it wasn't. This is a terrible film and no one should watch it. Best part is the Polaroid they created from the Hitchhike's point of view. Even though he wasn't in the van at the time the picture would have been taken.",2022-03-13

"It is what it is. Worst movie of 2022, why?This movie has no common sense. I dont even know why this movie had been produced.Why do you make movies that stays with the usual gore movies in the past, where the characters has no brains at all.At the last scene, all the people are killed with their friends but they have the time to roll the windows down and open the sunroof before rushing the hell out of there. They even left the chainsaw inside where they didnt even make sure that the killer is dead. They do have the opportunity to behead it but no, just relax couple of people walking out of the park like nothing happened. This has no sense at all.",2022-02-19
"A slasher by any other name and this would still be utter garbage. The premise of picking up 50 years later could've worked if someone put one iota of thought into it.The characters are shallow and I was happy to seem them all die. Trying to be, I don't know, woke? The movie doesn't know what it wants, wavering between anti gun and pro gun - I'm not from America and I could pick up on that.Save your time and go watch the original movie, this is garbage. Probably the worst attempt at the movie yet.The only redeeming thing about it, is that it's short.",2022-02-21
"This film is so bad that it was sold to the Netflix junkyard of failures. If this alone doesn't tell you more than you need to know - well, I don't know.Sure, lets make a sequel to THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE and call it TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. That alone should be enough for you. No? Alright.The story is by Fede Alvarez, amongst others. Why you need more than one toddler to come up with this mess of a ""story"", I don't know, but the name Fede Alvarez should ring a bell. It's the guy who always writes unlikable characters getting trapped with a morally ambiguous villain with lots of implausible stuff happening and, strangely, gets applauded for it.Look, I'm not even sure who I'm supposed to sympathize with. They killed Leatherface's mom, so don't they deserve all of this? But isn't Leatherface also a ruthless and psychopathic killer? So smart, Fede.But whatever. This is kinda gory, so if you're into that, you might enjoy ten minutes of this film. Unless your immersion is killed by bad acting or offensively bad writing, that is. I'd advise you to skip this and rewatch the original instead. Because while the original doesn't have a great story or nicely written characters either, it still gets to you with its gritty authenticity and innovative approach - something this film is lightyears away from. Instead, you get tired trope after tired trope in what seems to be an overly long film with a runtime of 83 minutes.The cinematography for this crap was actually quite decent, and while this is usually enough to keep me invested at least a little bit, the stupid writing and braindead direction of this pointless fan fiction outweighed it by quite a lot. It's so bad it's actually bad. You have been warned.",2022-02-22
"Why? That is the question. WHY?Texas Chainsaw is a dead series, it has failed for almost 20 years of reboots, like Rambo said ""let it go, let it go.""This is basically the exact same plot as the lazy Halloween reboot. There are some dialogue that is pretty much exactly the same, with the main character from the first one returns and basically says ""I've been waiting for my revenge.""BAM, Chainsaw through the body, dead! WHY? Why did they even bring back a character and just made them dumb as all hell and get chainsawed for being stupid?!Lazy, Lazy, Lazy, don't waste your precious time watching this on Netflix.1/10.",2022-02-21
"Of the ""Big Four"" Slasher franchises, ""Chainsaw"" was the least interesting. This new installment is no different.A group of Gen Z entrepreneurs head to the small town of Harlow, Texas to start up their new business venue, despite the disdain from from the locals that have lived there for years. An encounter with a dying old woman who ran the town's orphanage ends with her being taken away by authorities when she refuses to leave the place that no longer belongs to her. This ends with her dying in the back of the police vehicle, triggering the rage of old and hulky Leatherface, who she has been caring for since he got away with the original murders almost 50 years ago. Leatherface goes on a killing spree, killing anyone including the local characters, his main targets of course are the entrepreneurs.The movie has the ""Liberals vs. Conservatives"" crap that has plagued media and the internet. The characters were either dull, annoying, or downright stupid. However, I did start to feel bad for the main characters once Leatherface starts doing his thing and they started showing some bits of character development, plus there actually were moments with good suspense.The best part of the movie was the chainsaw massacre of partygoers trapped inside a bus. It's about time we actually saw a ""chainsaw massacre"" in one of these movies. Usually Leatherface picks people off one by one and usually with more than just chainsaws, but we actually get an entire sequence of him slaying multiple people with a chainsaw at once.Other stuff I had gripes with was how little the connection was to the original, besides mentioning the events and the Sally Hardesty character coming back to face Leatherface one more time.Leatherface was said to have gotten away in 1973 due to wearing a mask, but what about Drayton Sawyer or grandpa? Drayton worked at the gas station so people knew who he was. Sure he could've started hiding behind a new life, but his face would be all over wanted photos and evidence. But we get no word on him or grandpa, two important characters to the original.The characters were dumb, including Sally who just stands there rather than shooting and finishing Leatherface once and for all. This also unfortunately leads to her character getting killed off.Leatherface is also now Michael Myers/Jason levels of strength and invincibility, tanking bullets and ripping arms off with ease. He was just a big guy in the original, not some machine.He also gets away again, setting up yet another sequel that's probably gonna get turned into another reboot instead. An endless cycle that needs to stop. Now was this as bad as some of the other sequels/reboots? No, I'd actually place this somewhere in the middle in terms of ranking the entire franchise. But was this good and interesting? Also no.Please stop making these movies. If you're gonna do another Chainsaw movie, could you please just kill Leatherface off already? He always gets away and it's just annoying and uninteresting at this point.",2022-02-22
"Many of us remember the first time we watched the original '74 classic... and this new spin on the classic film was done well.The pacing was fast... 83 mins... Perfect for a horror/slasher film setting up the main protagonists as they journey unknowingly toward the trouble ahead, always in a car on a hot Texan day.As it's 2022, the modern day thinking of todays 20 somethings is written into the script well, along with all the creature comforts of mobile phone technology and internet access/posts.You just have to let reality dissipate for the 83 min run time and enjoy the ride... You know the main character, this is why the film was made, this is why horror fans continue to turn up to the show. It's just a matter of what will happen, and how will this chapter end... That why we watch...",2022-02-18
Please! Stop doing this. All those remakes or sequels are so bad. Just watch the original. There's just one Texas Chain Massacre. Tobe Hooper's version.,2022-02-28
"Yeah, the characters suck. Yeah, there are plot holes, and dumb decisions. But these people in the comments seem to have forgotten just how ridiculous the first one was. Are you going to tell me that Franklin was the pinnacle of character development? Do you remember the names, or ""back stories"" of any of the other characters in the first one, aside from ""vague hippie""? This one followed fairly well in the spirit of the first one. Two-dimensional characters make dumb choices, hide in stupid places. And get slaughtered. There are some memorable kills, and some pretty sly references to the original. Overall, not bad; you guys need to stop acting like the first one was Citizen Kane, because it definitely wasn't. Old Fogies wrapped up in nostalgia really missing out on a bit of campy fun in this one. Will I watch it again? Probably not, but I don't regret seeing it.",2022-02-20
"Leatherface returns in the 2020s generation in an Teax ghost town with tourists as victims. Nothing to say but it classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre that many old horror fans had loved since the 1970s.

"I'm not going to leave a huge review about acting, set design and cinematography. All I'm going to say is at some point logic needs to take hold in some of these slasher films. When you've got 15-20 people against 1 madman wielding a chainsaw, the people would overpower him. Let's just all die, instead! Wheeee!!!! TRASH!!!",2022-03-10
"I don't understand the motivation of producers and studios to make sequels, sequels or reboots without a really cool script. Every genre has the same film structure with the same trigger elements. Heroes should work and evoke empathy. And it doesn't matter that he or she will be killed in 40 minutes. In any case, I have to worry about him. In addition, the tape should have a detailed exposition so that the viewer understands the motivations of the acting characters and explanations of those decisions that were made off-screen. The center point must also be played at 100 percent.So here it is. From the above, the picture does not contain anything. Nothing works here. It looks more like a thrash comedy with rivers of blood. Not more. The plot is incomplete, the behavior of young people is simply maddening and exasperating. The logic of actions does not fit into my stupid head at all.A maniac who runs funny with a chainsaw is intended by the creators to look scary and cool, but he cannot oppose anything terrible.And the worst thing is that at the end, the authors attempted a possible sequel, creating a suitable ending. And this leads to really terrible thoughts - if this part turned out to be so worthless, then what can be expected from the next one?",2022-08-15
Netflix couldn't help themselves but throw in a spiel about the Confederate flag to remind us that mindless turds have taken over and are intent on ruining all our favorite franchises. Between that and the horrible acting and lame first kill I called it quits.,2022-02-19
What a waste of time! The only thing I liked about the movie was that electric car. The characters were beyond annoying and stupid. It made me want them to die! That's not something you want in a horror movie. They had no depth and not a proper story line. They were plain and simply stupid as. The movie felt soo dragged out as well! This movie did nothing for me and I was really disappointed as I am a big fan of TCM.,2022-02-18
Don't believe the negative rumours. Its solid entertainment with surprisingly excellent acting and some tight direction.It's not The Godfather but Texas Chainsaw Massacre it certainly is.,2022-02-19
"If you can't make it better, don't make it. Holy crap was this a bad movie. Yes the gore was really good but that's it. Stupid dumb people getting killed. Yay. The old surviving lady had Leatherface with a shotgun but lets him walk away??? WTF. I seriously didn't understand that. Then the guy said he had the deed but didn't. But the police their told the old lady to leave before even before those people came? The old lady still owned the house. WTF? And again, you never watched a horror movie before? You make sure the bad guy is dead. I'm so glad LF killed the sister. Too bad he didn't get them both. Also when someone grabs your head, you usually try to grab their hand to get it off, but the sister just had her hands down by her side so LF could just cut her head off perfectly. Wow, so really dumb crap there.",2022-02-21
It was not as good as I thought it would be. A totally different story then the others no continuation other then the first. The ending left much to be desired. I found the whole thing predictable. Maybe I have seen too many horror movies. But I kept waiting for them to surprise me and they didn't. They could have many times. This could have been really good. Disappointed.,2022-02-18
"You know, if the producers of the Texas Chainsaw franchise had simply remade the 2013 sequel-reboot, actually set it accurately in the 90s, not spend pennies on the gore effects, gotten good actors for it, and given it a grimy look, it could've been the perfect sequel and end to Leatherface. But no, we got this.Texas Chainsaw Massacre takes place in a small town in Texas, young hip teens are moving in to gentrify the area. But this leads to Leatherface beginning another killing spree, but this time, for revenge on those who caused his troubles.TexasChainsaw2022 leaves much to be desired for its version of Halloween2018; a sequel that recons all other instalments out of existence. This instalment pales in comparison to Halloween2018 however. There are questions first off. So TexasChainsaw2022 takes place in modern day, in the 2020's: when Leatherface in the 70s original would have been in his 30s or 40s at least. Leatherface was big and brawny but he wasn't a bodybuilder; In the modern day, he'd also be in his 80s or 90s by now. Is Leatherface immortal? He's comes off like Jason Voorhees a lot in the movie so probably (in one scene he seems to teleport from one end of the town to the other in seconds). Other questions: how did he end up in the town in this movie, is his caretaker in this movie just his babysitter or his actual mother? Too many questions. So many things in this movie make me wish so badly that the writers and director of the 2013 sequel had actually given a f@ck.Other than that, the hip gen z kids in this movie become very unlikeable, except from one girl, Lila, who is the closest we have to a main girl. She's fine, and (spoilers) it turns out she's the survivor of a school shooting, so I guess she's another one of those Casey from Split, Zoey from Escape Room type girls (characters who survived traumatic events etc). I did like the burly hillbilly guy Richter as well. And also like I said, its like the Halloween2018 movie; specifically, this movie brings back the character of Sally from the first movie (different actress however as Marilyn Burns, the original actress, sadly died in 2014). Nothing much to the character of Sally, even in the original movie she's just the final girl, but if this movie was going to give Sally the elderly Laurie Strode treatment and give her this decades old vendetta on Leatherface, it could have been so much better. As is, she hears he's returned, gets ready, shows up at the town, and (spoilers) dies, cheaply I might add. If you're a big fan of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, her death scene will only annoy you; not because she dies, but because of how she dies.If you're not gonna treat these characters with respect, if you're not gonna make a good sequel-reboot, why even make it. At lease the Halloween 2018 movie knew not to sh@t on the fans. This was just a cheap movie. Really, all that the producers needed to do was remake the 2013 movie, and actually make it good.4 out of 10.",2022-02-26

"I'm just really curious what subtext or enthralling story people are looking for within this franchise.. Not everything needs to be elevated. (And even then, they turn the tables on normal character stereotypes without even trying.) Also, since when do we expect all slasher villains to adhere to normal laws of what will and will not kill you? Where is the fun in that? They're in Texas... he has a chainsaw.. there is a massacre... and honestly, the movie itself is short enough for its shortcomings to be forgiven. It doesn't take itself too seriously and the kills had me yelling. My only real main gripe is that I think if you're going to turn up the kills up to 11.. the victims should probably stay dead.",2022-02-21

"Fun fact each Texas Chain Massacre movie has had a different title. You can look it up, sometimes words are spelled differently, or a ""The"" appears in the title. Why am I starting this review with a fun fact? The reason is simple I dreaded seeing this movie. I saw the original trailer and went, ""Wow, that movie looks terrible."" After I saw the trailer, I noticed it was being produced by Netflix, then everything made sense. Of course, a terrible sequel to a classic movie could only be made by the minds of the ""highly-intelligent"" workers at Netflix. Funny enough, the trailer was the best part of the movie.This is the eighth installment in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise. I enjoy the original 1974 classic, Tobe Hooper's 1986 sequel, and the 2003 remake. You might wonder how the other four films in this franchise are. I didn't talk about them because nobody needs to ever speak of them. This film falls into the category of the other four. It is an unnecessary sequel that brings Leather Face into the 21st century. Elsie Fisher does the best she can as the main character Lila. She was genuinely one of the only parts of this movie I liked. The worst part of this movie was the bus scene, ""Try anything, and You're canceled, Bro."" The ending was also pretty much just complete nonsense.4/10 A mess of a sequel that serves no real purpose.",2022-12-13

"This is bad even for TCM standards, though I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.A hilarious tonal shift on a party bus really changes the direction of this messy B-movie slasher romp. If they could have kept that laugh-out-loud energy going, then this could have been as good as Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2.Instead, the viewer is subjected to a film that really has no idea what it wants to be, other than maybe a comedic riff on Halloween 2018.Oh, and hopefully you've never lived in Texas, so you don't realize how this doesn't look or feel remotely like the iconic state in the film's title.Also, and I know this is stupid to even bring up in a TCM review, but seriously - what is this timeline? Who is this magical Leatherface-suppressing orphanage lady? Why is Leatherface 76 years old with the strength and agility of Kratos?One thing I'll give this movie is it has pretty good gore scenes and our boy LF racks up the hipster body count, so that's fun.Otherwise, it's laughably bad, which may be intended. I smiled throughout the short runtime, so it's hard for me to be too upset about how most of the many abandoned plotlines make little to no sense at all.If you go into this movie expecting a horror follow-up to the original 1974 classic, then you are going to hate this film. It has all the worst things that you can possibly imagine them doing to the lore.But, if you go in expecting a corny B-movie slasher comedy with some good gore, then you may get a kick out of it.Even though I had fun laughing at this movie, there's no way I could even give it an average score of 5/10. It's not average. It's honestly a terrible movie.4/10.",2022-02-21

Wait, shouldn't this film be cancelled? It had no asians or lesbians or gays??? Oh wait, there was that one asian threatining to cancel leatherface, my bad. Well, I'm sure twitter will cancel it. Well, maybe not, it does include a black guy with a hot blond chick. Hollywood checklist almost complete. Lord knows they are the voice of reason and diversity and free speech. Well, let me take that back. If you disagree with anything they say then there will be no reason or free speech what so ever....but hey, can't expect ppl to adhere to there own principles can you?

"The original TCM is my all time fave horror film. I despised the 1986 sequel as well as the third film from 1990, and I didn't care much for any of the others aside from the 2003 remake (and even that fell short).This 2022 sequel to the original has countless script issues and shoved several political agendas down the viewer's throat, which instantly turned me off. It's also difficult to accept a 70+ year old Leatherface acting more brutal than a young Jason Vorhees. Yet it was kind of entertaining to see such a gory slasher film on Netflix. Just wish they would've used a different franchise to do this.Please just stop these already. None of the sequels have done a THING to compliment the original.",2022-02-21

Actually laughable when they're all getting massacred on a party bus whilst trying to get it all on FB live. Watching the old Chainsaws I would be like ""nooo don't kill her!"" This one I was like ""Yes, please chop her in half"". Honestly, I think it would have been better if they made it into a farce because you can't take one minute of it seriously.

A cheap cash-in filmed entirely on a film stage, appealing to Gen Z, apparently. The 2003 reboot had its differences from the original, but it wasn't anywhere near as bad as this B listed hot garbage. This is what a new film school student would make for a project.",2022-02-20
"Decent enough entry into this saga. Entertaining and watchable. Nothing groundbreaking, but good enough to watch.Of course you have the typical bad decision making you see in all these films.",2022-02-21
"I admit, I was very skeptical of this film, the fact that Netflix was behind it all, the fact that the test screenings had gone wrong, the fact that as a franchise, Texas Chainsaw massacre, it seemed dead now, in short, all these factors to me. They had discouraged, and instead I'm happy to say that I was wrong, this film is a really great reboot, it doesn't reach the levels of perfection of the platinum dunes biology (the top of the franchise in my opinion) but still it is not too far from it. The story finally tries to tell something new, the characters of the ""good guys"" are hateful, but the thing is intentional and it works wonders, Leatherface is truly a destructive fury and the level of violence of the film is very high, some scenes, especially at the end they are very gore and brutal.In conclusion, a fabulous return for our old friend Leatheface.",2022-02-18
"This movie was enjoyable for no more than what it was. I am glad it streamed on Netflix because it certainly would not have been worth the cost of admission, but the pacing wasn't too bad and as long as you keep your expectations reasonably low, it can be a a fun way to spend an hour and a half. This movie easily could have been produced and made for Sy-FY and it would not have made much of a difference. The plot is sub-par, but again, keeping expectations low, this film will deliver.",2022-03-05
Absolute woke cringe. Awful. Netflix needs to stop decimating and desecrating on long running franchises. Why do Netflix feel the need to make every movie and show so political. It's like Netflix cares more about pushing their political agenda than making half decent movies/shows. I think its time to unsubscribe to netflix for good.,2022-02-19
Fake women empowerment and feminism ruined another good old movie after terminator and ghost busters with female cast. I really don't understand why do producers even bother to make such movies?,2022-02-26
I can't believe they managed to remake a movie but make it much worse than the original.Total waste of time! Watch The chainsaw massacre: the beginning if you want a good horror one.,2022-02-23
"Well, you know... as someone who loved the original, but has hated every franchise episode since, I have to say I really enjoyed this. So I thought I'd try to bump the average rating up a bit. I was going to give it a 7.5, but as I can't do fractions here, I thought it only fair to round up instead of down.How many of us over our lifetimes have felt aggrieved at the way money seems to sweep in and displace the known and loved for many previous generations? Neighbourhoods that become unaffordable to current residents due to gentrification schemes. Family businesses destroyed by faceless, distant corporations.That's the subtext in this film. Here, the invading forces are the young, entitled, vacuous legions of social media 'influencers' who make more money in a couple of videos than you may have made in a year, or even a lifetime. The foodies, the beauty experts, the therapists... even those whose only 'skill' seems to be playing computer games, streaming themselves playing them, then lapping up the advertising revenue thanks to the hits from their millions of fans.So when an expensive car-load of such young, newly-enriched people pitch up in a remote Texas town - full of their media-savvy arrogance, their empty assumptions, their instant judgements - and start acting like they own the place (so crass and gross is their sense of entitlement), I think I can be a forgiven for looking forward (vicariously) to the ensuing bloodbath. It's no spoiler to say that I'm not disappointed.There are some great moments in this movie that made me laugh out loud. Not just the cutting and slicing, but the knowing nods to the obsessions of the smartphone age. When, for instance, Leatherface boards the busload of 'followers' with chainsaw revving, what's the first thing they do? Hold up their phones to film the spectacle to ensure their instant hits on Instagram, Youtube or whatever. I've actually myself witnessed a serious car crash, where a couple of bystanders stopped to take photos on their phone before even thinking of dialing emergency services or seeing if they could help anyone.So... in my view, well worth the watch if you feel the same way about these things. And if you just simply enjoy a good, gory slasher movie with some excellent set pieces to gratify your appetite.Other reviewers have mentioned the lack of sympathetic characters in this. But there is one. The only one in the whole movie who demonstrates real, genuine emotion.You'll have to watch it to find out who.",2022-02-19
This was the worst movie of my life and I'm 32 years old. So I've had a fair share of movies. My God.The killer jumps out of the water like a god damn fish of some kind. Every character is just plain stupid. Whoever directed this film should never go near a camera again.,2022-02-19
"Yeah, they massacred the franchise, there were so many good options, but why go for a good story if you can just go blood & gore?A lot of small stuff got cut I think, why the hell are they even there? A little backstory would be nice... and why is the mechanic living in a deserted town? You have to wait way too long before you know what happened with the sister in the past.Leatherface can make a mess, but that's nothing compared to the mess the editors left us with.I gave 1 point for the 'livestreaming' in the bus, another one for the link with the past.",2022-02-23
What a stupid story. The whole cast were idiots.Everyone was behaving totally opposite to how a normal person will act in such circumstances. And that Maniac not dying after 5 shots of shotgun and a throat cut. The writers of this movie were really smoking some good stuff.,2022-02-20
"Overall, not bad but not good either. Still an improvement over the last one in 2013 (no I haven't seen Leatherface but I will look for it after this).Some gory fun to be had if you can just endure the first 10 minutes where it's impossible not to wish a grisly death for one of the main characters. And the movie delivers on the thrills, although still that Jessica Biel one is unbeatable.The main problem is the small town feels like a set, and the usual dumb decisions. My favorite is still the Jessica Biel one and the Matt Bomer prequel 15 years ago.",2022-02-19
"Sure it wasn't perfect but better than the last couple of ""requels."" Go in with moderate expectations and you should enjoy. If nothing else the gore is plentiful and creative.",2022-02-19
"Here be Texas Chain-spoilers, but I'm not worried because no one will watch this movie... Or will they?... No seriously, don't.Oh dear lord what have I done so wrong to have to endure this?Whoever sold this to Netflix certainly took the money and ran far, far away and we are the ones who get stuck with this abomination.First the good.....Um.....there were killings, yeah.........and Leatherface.....he was there too....there was a chainsaw as well....yes I think I remember seeing one....As for the bad, I tried to voice my concerns to my wife who had no idea what I was even talking about so if you would allow me to vent to you....WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?1. Traveling into the heart of backwoods Texas from a big city and what is the first thing you do? Insult the natives for no other reason then you believe you are better than them and you want them to know they are all instantly sexists and racists. That'll put you on their good side.2. Woke multi-ethnic moody modern gen X borderline non-binary social networked better than you teens who have experienced extreme trauma that we will find out nothing about? Check! Don't want them? Too bad, you got tons of them.3. So you bought a town to show to invertors to make into a haven for hipsters, but you decide to ACTUALLY GO THERE AND GET IT READY for said investors A FEW HOURS before they get there? Nothing can go wrong there. Hold on a sec, need to barge into this house and kick an old lady out, because I'm a modern teen and I can.4. You have an auction (Why?) and food for everyone, as you told the cops at the beginning; there are 2 experienced chefs there, so why are you trying to 'wow' your investors with crappy hamburgers and hot dogs on a grill?5. The whole final girl from the first movie hunting Leatherface for 50 years sounds a lot like another mask wearing horror franchise I know, except they actually accomplished what they set out to do, this one was trying so hard to do the same but it was painful and pitiful.6. The ending, how exactly was it shocking? Explain that to me? Who was watching this movie, saw that and went ""Oh my god! Now THAT came out of nowhere! That's a first for this franchise! My Heart!!"" You survived, got into your eco-friendly car to speed away at 2 miles an hour, then start joking and open ALL THE WINDOWS! Seriously, how many times has this been done before and now we're suppose to care.7. The actual end was a rehash of the original ending except this time no one cared. The teen he just killed seriously should have been killed a half hour earlier at at least 3 points in the movie, and her sister 'getting away' in the car? Leather face could have just killed here very easily. Why let her live? So she can vlog about it?8. The bus massacre scene. Instead of trying to get out a window or maybe the emergency exit you just hide in the bathroom and are surprised the he knows your in there. Then when your sister finds a magical escape exit (after everything you have just gone and are going through) you decide to give up right there?9. Not one character really showed any true terror, they just seemed to go through the motions and as the movie went on you could see all the terror or trauma or emotion vanish and characters either had too little emotion concerning the events around them or overreaction to the point of comedy. I'll sum it up like this, all of the actors in this movie all added up equal 1 Hayden Christianson in both the prequel trilogies he was in.10. Guy just died after loosing all this blood falling to the floor, getting up, somehow walking down stairs and out the door about half a block. No one run up to see if this lone figure needs help, everyone stay far away and continue to ask if they need help. Then tell everyone to get to the bus and stay calm as you leave the dead guy out in the sidewall in the open for everyone to see.I could go on and I usually do since there were tons of cringe 'why am I even watching this? Why is this town full of stupid people?' moments but I'll spare you, just because I suffered doesn't mean you have to!Save yourselves!Run!Run up the stairs, into the killers room and hide under his bed with your foot sticking out while he's there killing someone.A least that way the odds are pretty good he'll kill you so you don't have to watch this.",2022-02-22

"This has received a lot of 1 star user reviews, but none that I've read have touched upon what I'm going to say. This is easily one of the most disgusting, depraved movies I've ever watched. It's basically one step from being a snuff movie, given how realistic and convincing the special effects are at this point. I seriously question the mentality of anyone who derives pleasure from this. There is a lot of violence and evil in the world, who in their right mind watches more of it for entertainment? Yes, I chose to watch it, and I instantly regretted it (I watched it right before going to sleep, as well). The apparently already infamous bus scene was absolutely harrowing, and it stayed with me for days. It is no surprise that this film was hugely popular on a certain streaming service, you all know the one I'm talking about, it constantly stoops to new lows. This movie is truly sick and completely nihilistic. There is nothing of value in it. My advice is to avoid watching this at all costs.",2022-03-09
"This movie was actually better than what I thought it would be! It was intense, with plenty of wild and gruesome kills! Exactly what you want in a TCM movie. And the fact that the original survivor from the 1974 movie made a return, makes it even better.",2022-02-19
"The only reason this gets 2 stars instead of one is because it lived up to my expectations that it would be a horrible mess. I don't understand why this pathetic excuse for a film is getting even mediocre reviews. It is hot garbage preying on the so called ""woke"" sect that hopefully won't even appeal to them. To call this a film is even going too far. Everyone involved should be ashamed of using a classic IP and putting the last nail in the coffin.",2022-02-18
"That's what this movie feels like. But before I go any further if you enjoyed the last couple movies in this series just watch it. Not it's not as good, but yes it's worth the barely hour and a half of your time. But onward we go. There are good scenes and bad scenes, neat story elements and bad story elements. But unfortunately more bad than good. From the weird half racist/southern stereotype, to the tech big city stereotype, it just feels unnatural in every way. It distracts from the movie. Also the Texan is like half good guy if you think about it? Even tho he's portrayed as a bad guy. He has a gun, the others don't like it= that's your opening segment and he is bad guy. Just stupid stuff like that irritates me but it is what it is. Not every movie has to be catered to my specific liking. Little gripes aside, so many bad decisions are made by the characters left and right and then left and right again. The bus scene was the highlight in my opinion but still just weird seeing it portrayed on tik tok (vine was better) in a HORROR movie. But yea, hope this helps at least a little on your decision to watch or not. Have a great day!",2022-02-19
"It's been 48 years since the first Texas Chainsaw movie came out. After the success of Halloween, it makes more sense why this Netflix film exists in the first place. Following the same approach as Halloween, the legacy character Sally Hardesty returns from the original film which is now being played by Olwen Fouéré.Synopsis:
Set in a ghost town named Harlow, A group of idealistic individuals who claim to build a good world has to face the infamous Leatherface.Cinematic Analysis:
Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a baseless film totally trying to bake itself on nostalgia. The film doesn't even bother to develop the characters and there are no solid dialogues or impressive soundtrack/bgm that can help to induce a feeling of terror in the audience's mind.I wasn't expecting anything new from this dead franchise but the lack of tension increases its dullness level exponentially.Even with so much bloodshed film remains boring because everything is happening exactly as expected, scene by scene. The return of legacy character doesn't contribute in any way. They just wasted this character.Talking about cinematography, there were a few things here and there that were good but nothing special. The quality of the film seemed cheap to me.I only see two positive aspects of this film. The first one is that the film is just a little longer than an hour & ends pretty soon. The second one is that the characters are not irritating and we don't need to scratch our heads. I didn't had any problem while watching it.Conclusion:
Netlfix's Texas Chainsaw Massacre serves the exact same story we have seen in this franchise's previous instalments. The only thing this film gives you is a lot of killing. If you want that you can watch this film.For me, it's just another Watch It-Forget It kinda movie. Nothing interesting, nothing disappointing.Follow Me on Instagram: m_movie_reviews.",2022-02-20

This movie is effing effed up. There are a lot of kills and tons of blood. This is a good thing. The guy that plays leather face is basically perfect for the role and his skin mask is truly scary. THIS is how leather face should look. This isn't my favorite one of the series but maybe 3rd or even 2nd.,2022-02-19
"First of all i just wanna say that i was one of the people who watch the whole Texas Chainsaw franchise, from the original 1974 masterpiece, the fun 1986 sequel, the great 1990 third movie, the horrible and awful Next Generation, an ok 2003 remake, the good 2006 The Beginning prequel, the pretty good Texas Chainsaw 3D, and so do the terrible and a disrespectful 2017 origin movie Leatherface, all of that i watch in 2 weeks besides the original just to prepared for this one, and all i can say is that this movie is simply pay off, also i'm pretty sure if you watch the whole franchise most likely you will like or at least enjoy David Blue Garcia Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and for those who only watch the original most likely will not like this movie, and for me this movie is not only good, it's really really good, i found David Blue Garcia Texas Chainsaw Massacre as the true real solid sequel for the original movie, is it better than the original or is as good as the original or still less better than the original?, after i watch this movie i can really see the original 1974 Texas Chainsaw Massacre and David Blue Garcia Texas Chainsaw Massacre combine became one as a 3 hour movie, add with just one black screen titled 50 years later after the ending of the original then straight forward to the beginning of this movie, David Blue Garcia Texas Chainsaw Massacre is also the most violence out of all in the franchise, the goryness are all solid, disturbing, and graphic, the performances are all incredible, and one thing that really stuck with me is how they used Sally Hardesty in here, what they did to her character is exactly the same with Jamie Lee Curtis in the 2018 Halloween reboot, the differences is that i was way more excited for Sally to just like ""it's been 50 years and i come back for revenge"" than Jamie Lee Curtis in the Halloween reboot, i was excited and i was into it, overall David Blue Garcia Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a perfect real sequel and this is all i want from the day i start watching the whole franchise because everytime i watch all the sequel and prequel it's always like ""it's still not near good as the original"" even though i did think some of them was really good, so it pay off perfectly, this movie is extremely gory fills with a great story, it's exciting, it just great, it's one of the best films of the year and i did still gonna put the original on number one in my Texas Chainsaw franchise rank and this one being the second just because i feel this was the real continuation for the original and i probably still gonna see this and the original as a one movie just separated by years and that's how much i like this one.",2022-02-19

SMH do better.I love horror movie and I've watched so many, and this one HAS to be the worst one yet.I don't know how they did it but they managed to make me hate Texas even more.The final girl from the last movie wasn't even a part of the story until the second half of the movie.",2022-09-22

"This absolutely stunk. The only reason it's not gotten a zero is because the gore and kill scenes weren't bad. This had the biggest ""all lives matter"" feel. Why am I looking at leatherfaces real face in the beginning..? We should never even see much of his mask.. I cannot believe one of the lines was ""try anything and you'll get cancelled, bro"" ..wow..
we get it. You're woke. Stop rubbing it it so much it makes you forget about the point of the movie. It's killing the horror genre. Look at Jordan Peele movies. He is amazing. He's single handedly holding up the horror genre. Making them inclusive of everyone but doesn't need to smear it in everyone's face. We just understand it.The mask sucked. Looked embarrassing.We'll never see another TCM after this. Congratulations on massacring the franchise.",2022-02-19
"I'm a huge fan of the original and Tobe.And I also like Michael bay's take on the franchise but this? Well.. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either. It lacked something I quite can't put my hands on..What was the point of this when we had the 2013 one? That was also a sequel.Wish they would stop all these sequel takes on new sequel. It gets to confusing and I don't really see it necessary.The whole idea of the 2022 one, is kinda good. But lacks some
Depth, yea it's a horror, but there's just to much kills, too much blood.. and it's a very cliche storyline with a very cliche ending.Is it really impossible to nowadays to make a horror movie similar to the original one with a lot of strangety feel to it and not have a blood bath all the time, horror don't need gore to be scary.And Leatherface has suddenly became immortal? What kinda Jason Voorhees - Michael Myers deadbyte thing is this? Yeah sure I agree Leatcherface should be able to take a few hits and maybe a few shots but damn, 4-6 gunshots??? And not die??That was too much.It was at times exciting and interesting to follow and see how everything would
Unfold.. but it never really got there.5/10 for me. Go watch the original 74' and the 2003 remake! Good actors, great

"I know horror movies are not best known for their plots but this was horrendous to watch. Nothing makes sense, no character development, just a bunch of stereotypes, leather face can teleport or something, nobody thinks straight.... nothing makes sense tbh this seemed cheap and almost completely lacking of effort.It's so difficult to root for any of the characters when they're making the most obvious silly decisions, not trying at all to survive, and the plot purposely makes everything go wrong for the characters without trying to be convincing in the slightest.The VFX and make up was great tho.",2022-02-26
"I was laughing a lot about how many current events they tried shoving into this movie. Culture, school shootings, racism, typical millennial behaviors, economic issues, etc. None of it was necessary for the plot at all. And to top it off, Leatherface was born in 47, making him 73yrs old in this movie. It's highly unrealistic that a 73yr old would be able to do any of this. I am a fan of gore and slasher movies. There were some pretty good scenes, directing was good, main character sisters were decent.",2022-02-18
"Lean and mean, the latest Texas Chainsaw reboot is a true sequel to the original movie, set 50 years after the events of To be Hooper's 1974 classic.Bloody, fast moving, and with a thick streak of black-as-night humour, I enjoyed this modern take on the Leatherface story. There are all the familiar horror tropes here, but the fast pace, killer soundtrack, and quality production values make this worthy of a watch.",2022-02-18
"I was hoping for something to hold up since the legit only last good TCM movies was back in 2003 and 2006. And this was VERY disappointing. It was a ""requel"" and just didn't impress at all. The acting was very cringy and the pace was very quick. The plot definitely seemed like something a high school creative writing student could come up with. VERY 2020's with the newer generation related to school shootings and social media and just made it very in your face (trying to show off about our current culture) and just wasn't executed neatly enough if those were going to be included. I don't think I finished it and didn't care to... I turned it off it off with 30mins left.However 2 stars for the crazy graphic gore/content.",2022-02-22
"A movie that is repetitive, semi well-made, has decent VFX gore, lacks of course in decisions, logic and depth with a super unrealistic ending.The pinnacle of the protagonists is of course screaming and running, as almost nobody has the means to put up a fight, aside the lady of the past and to some extent the wannabe ""sisters"".The antagonist is not that guy from the past, is strong but not invincible and is not served with a big IQ. So, what he's able to do, especially physically (after being shot at) is total nonsense, spoon fed to viewers by the bright team of writers!In fact the first half of the movie, up to the running chainsaw was more interesting than the second half with the wielding stuff emanating diesel fumes.It is mildly entertaining, does not satisfy fans of the genre very much, is simplistic and straightforward and the minimalistic cops were sleeping and dreaming heavily while others were being chopped off and with no more inhabitant in that ghost rural town.P. S. Unfortunately, that's a movie which budget was thrown outta window and I wonder what Netflix is doing in and with this production, while a bunch of its ""urgent"" productions need a way tighter screening and schedule, including some of its series that fans are awaiting for a long time!Overall, grade C-Screenplay/story: 6.5Development: 7.5Realism: 7Entertainment: 7.5Acting: 7Filming/cinematography: 7.5Visual/special effects: 8.5Music/score: 7.5Depth: 2Logic: 2Flow: 7Thrill/horror: 7.5Ending/closure: 1.",2022-02-21

"The Netflix adoption of Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a direct sequel based on the original movie by Tobe Hooper and two anyone who is reading this and saying ""hey, but Texas Chainsaw 3D (2013) was supposed to be a direct sequel"" well not anymore according to the movie.The plot is that it's been 50 years since the first massacre and now a group of Generation Z goes to an abandoned town to auction on a utopia town free from violence, but an old lady who owns an orphan home, not only does she refuse to leave her home, but when she dies the grown orphan boy Leather Face becomes mad and decide to kill everyone in town.Aside from that, Sally Hardesty returns from the first except it is not the original actress who played (R. I. P Marilyn Burns), but instead Olwen Fouéré and she becomes the Laurie Strode from Halloween 2018. But unlike Halloween 2018, where Laurie was the main focus of the movie, here her character was just nothing but an afterthought.Overall, the story is bad, the characters are either unlikable or forgettable but they all get slaughtered in the end. Leatherface feels more like Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees than being human, and bad writing, the good thing I can say about the movie is that does have good Gore.",2022-02-28
"This is nothing new but it is fairly entertaining for the sort of film it is. You know the story; out of towners go where they don't belong and up pops the Sawyer family.There are hints of the Halloween reboot here (original survivor hunting Leatherface) but thankfully the story doesn't centre on that and, instead, spends more time on two of the new characters.What makes this a decent entry are the kills (first one is particularly brutal). This is a violent bloodbath which we want from a Texas Chainsaw film. Good effects and gore.This film is under 90 minutes so doesn't outstay its welcome. The shots are nice, characters ""okay"" for the sort of film it is and there are some stand out scenes. It never really feels like it drags.That being said, there are some REALLY stupid moments in it. One example: a character is tapped with the chainsaw and drops dead. Another character is penetrated with the chainsaw, held aloft and buzzed for a couple of minutes and then launched away with a might swing. They take forever to die and I can't help but wonder what the filmmakers were thinking when they did it this way but hey ho - it looked cool on screen and, by then, my brain was properly switched off.Worth a watch and probably the best of the sequels / remakes.",2022-02-18

The camera work was not bad, everything else was pure woke cliche Crap.Starts off with an old racist cop, who seems not too keen on a black guy dating a white girl and two lesbians in the back seat.They get to the town the Sheriff is watching over and it's completely empty.This movie wasted no time showing it's true colors.If you're into films that try too hard to fit a social narrative, look no further.I don't mind watching films like this if they sprinkle it in a little like Jordan Peele, but they just take it too far too fast with this one.",2022-02-21

"I get it that in horror movies some characters must make stupid decisions. But in this one almost every character is dumb as a bag of rocks.Well when i mean characters i mean people cause there is no real characters in this movie. Not to mention after 20 minutes into the movie i couldn't care less which one dies.There were some good scenes and cinematography was not bad, but if you don't give us even a single character we should care about then the entire point of a slasher movie is zero..",2022-02-27
"Texas Chainsaw Massacre is something that should not be a franchise, and this movie just continues the long list of reasons why.Starting with the good: the sound design and cinematography are actually quite impressive, emphasising the run-down nature of the rural town.And, I'll admit I did get a perverse sense of satisfaction watching a bunch of pampered millennials pull out their phones and start live streaming as their first reaction to a blood-stained man with a chainsaw approaching them....I guess there are no more good things. This is one of the most absurd, self-serious horror films I've seen in quite some time.The script introduces one character who has some backstory that could lend itself to a satisfying arc. But it really doesn't go anywhere. This character has maybe 20 minutes of screen time, and the story is completely disconnected from her past.All of the characters are so stupid, repeatedly (and seemingly deliberately) ignoring escape routes and weapons that are at their disposal.The original film's final girl plays a role in this film, but her presence is completely unnecessary and this movie totally disrespects her and what she did in the first one.Another question that this film never bothers to answer is this: how has Leatherface managed to stay hidden for fifty years and why did he just decide to stop going on killing sprees during that time? Why does he come back now? His introduction in this movie doesn't make a lick of sense.Yet another Texas Chainsaw film that shouldn't exist. None of them should exist besides the first one.",2022-02-20

"First and foremost ignore all the comments that lead you to believe all the hype is for nothing and the film fails. The film doesn't fail. To add to that most sequels do fail. Looking for ways to smash any films that come our way post lockdown with bitterness really. Unfair on this one because all in all there wasn't anything to dislike.You ask for jump scares and horror you got that as you'd typically expect in one of the many films of the chainsaw franchise. You get a story, okay sure there isn't much to like about them not very interesting, the first act is a bit flat and tacky lacks a lot in the visual front, but then you get what you'd expect. I'm not a lover of this movie but certainly not a hater. As a matter of fact compared with most if not all horrors lately with the same boring I live in a mansion and have a crush type of stuff they keep making this is sequel is about the best so far that's gone out of the lockdown era. How about that.",2022-02-19
"Sure there's plot holes that you could drive a semitruck through, but overall not bad. Gory kills, fun throwbacks and decent acting bring this one together. The ending could have used some tlc, and some more explanation of what these people were doing here would've been nice, but I didn't really watch this movie for any of that. I watched it to see Leatherface do his thing and his thing he indeed does do. Unlike all of the other films in the series, I feel this is the only one that actually lives up to it's name. There is a massacre in this movie that involves more than 1 or 2 people at a time. It was pretty glorious to finally see one movie in the series get that part right, which is why I bumped it up a star. Also, the cinematography was surprisingly exquisite. For a film of this ilk to have such beautiful shot in it, I was impressed. I recommend if you like gory slashers, or if you're a fan of the series. If not, this one will not change your mind.",2022-02-18

"I randomly found out on the radio that this movie came out today on Netflix. So I watched it right away.This movie was fun to watch. There was so much gore. And the script included many ""ah-ha! Gotcha! Moments, and I really liked that.I loved the way leather face was portrayed in this film. He was huge and terrifying; his entire look was flawless. I also loved how he wielded the chainsaw - I mean he moved that thing beautifully.That scene with the cellphones was hilarious. Loved it.I loved the camera angles too and I loved when he clearly posed with the chainsaw for the camera/viewers. It was cool.The acting of the two sisters was great. They were very believable and I have zero complaints, but especially Fischer towards the end.Ending - I laughed immediately when I saw and was a bit bittersweet, but befitting of a leather face movie.Conclusion:
Excellent flick to watch anytime alone or with friends/family. Definitely recommend.",2022-02-18

You should expect a badass leatherface that is brutally murdering a group of young people in an entertaining way and this film delivered that.

It is miles ahead of the leatherface movie that we got last time.",2022-02-20

"I have seen all the Texas Chainsaw films and this one was short, gory and to the point. The most recent sequels to me feel just like remakes or reboots of the original and added nothing to the series but just to bring back Leatherface and all his craziness.

"It's clear as day that the producers of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" saw David Gordon Green's 2018 reboot of ""Halloween"" and thought they could accomplish the same kind of comeback for Leatherface. Once again, there's a sequel that skips all the previous films and remakes but the first movie, and it's designed to center the story of a survivor. In this case, it's Sally Hardesty (Olwen Fouéré, replacing Marilyn Burns, who passed in 2014), the only person who made it out alive in Tobe Hooper's earth-shaking original. She's been trying to find the creature who killed her friends for years, and the Netflix Original sets them against each other. Sorta. Just barely. Everything about David Blue Garcia's film is ""sorta just barely"" (other than the gore, which is impressive). It's one of those projects that's clearly been through the wringer in terms of production-there were stories of a replaced directing team and horrible test screenings-and yet it feels like it was doomed from the beginning. It's a startling misfire, a movie that fundamentally fails at almost everything it's trying to do. Believe it or not, ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is another cautionary tale about gentrification. (I'm not kidding.) Melody (Sarah Yarkin), her sister Lila (Elsie Fisher), and their friend Dante (Jacob Latimore) have come to the middle of nowhere in Harlow, Texas to renovate the small town. They're even bringing in a bus of influencers to see the space. (The bus may as well say ""Chainsaw Victims"" on the side.) When they arrive, they run into immediate conflict with a homeowner (Alice Krige) who insists that she's not leaving. It turns out that she's the Norma Bates of this situation, and when she's forced from her home, her son Leatherface (Mark Burnham) goes on a rampage.""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" attempts the same thing and gets so lost on the way home.On Netflix today.",2022-02-18
"Well this movie was not exciting enough to be a train wreck, just more of a migraine, the kind where you feel vaguely like throwing up and just pray for the noise to stop.Shot in Bulgaria with a cast that is basically what you get when you try to get Hollywood actors in Bulgaria on a Netflix budget, and bogged down by off-the-shelf suspense music, an apparently nonexistent script and every ham-handed horror trope in the book, it's the kind of movie where everything is noticeably off, right down to hair and wardrobe.It is no small wonder the original directors bailed a week into filming. The replacement director is a pony tail guy who makes energy drink commercials for a living. An energy drink is actually a good idea if you want to stay awake through this flick as it's a full 49 minutes into the 81 running time before a single chainsaw gets fired up.There is not much entertainment to be had here unless you might get a kick out of watching a busload of Austin hipsters getting sawed on, but that's hardly worth sitting through an hour of snores for. Go watch The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986) instead, it's the only really good one out of the franchise.And by the way, no... Bulgaria does not look like Texas, at all. Of course it doesn't.",2022-02-20

"Even though 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' isn't my very favorite slasher series, I was really looking forward to this movie, because I love slashers and sequels in general. When I very first watched it, I mostly liked it, but there were two things that bugged me. After going back and watching it again and knowing what to expect, I enjoyed and appreciated it much more. For this movie, you need to just turn your brain off, and enjoy the carnage! It was a fun watch and screaming at the screen when characters make dumb decisions. Leatherface is supposed to be at least 70 years old now, but he can still run while carrying a heavy chainsaw and won't die, even after being shot several times. It makes no sense, but that's why I love it! It's cheesy in the best way!The movie takes place about 50 years after the original 1974 classic. (None of the other sequels exist, just like Halloween 2018) Some young social media influencers/entrepreneurs named Melody, Lila, Dante, and Ruth are going to a ghost town in Harlow, Texas to fix it up and make it livable again. Melody and her sister, Lila have a strained relationship because Lila was attacked during a school shooting and Melody is extremely overprotective of her.When they arrive in town, they find an orphanage, still inhabited by an elderly lady. They basically try to kick her out and she begins having seizures. On the way to the hospital, she dies, which angers Leatherface and he's soon up to his old tricks again. He decides to bring out his trusty chainsaw and begins slaughtering them all.Sally Hardesty, the original survivor comes back and tries to put an end to Leatherface once and for all. Personally, I wasn't too happy how they handled her character.Probably the main highlight of the movie is the bus scene they show in the trailer. All the teens try to 'cancel' Leatherface, but he ain't having it and turns into John Wick with a chainsaw.If you love the series, and slashers in general, I would definitely recommend TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE!!!",2022-02-20
"The film is a gorefest with a lackluster plot yet it kept my attention. I loved the updated kills and the ending I thought was great 😂. Listen I see all these ""woke"" reviews and yea there is some racial tension issue in the beginning but really who cares? If anything they laugh at with the bus scene and cancel culture. Some of you viewers need to realize the demographic they're going for. I don't agree with cancel culture and all that other garbage but it's a movie!! I don't feel there was anything crazy ""woke"" about it. I feel ppl just want something to complain about. It's a straight low budget gory film that entertains in its short run time. The kills are brutal and it def has a Halloween Kills thing going on. I Would've given it a higher score but one scene just bothered me, missed opportunity's we will say. You'll understand. Get your own opinion and enjoy.",2022-02-19

This was by far the worst TCM. The wokeism was nauseating. I couldn't wait for everyone to die in this movie. Don't waste your precious time. I wouldn't make my worst enemy watch this dribble.,2022-02-20
Good horror movies are usually not extremely predictable and this was easy to predict with extremely subpar acting from the leads. Yarkin is now at the top of my list for actors that will make me immediately skip over a movie for. Movie was beyond predictable and the plot and how it plays out is beyond unrealistic. Just another slasher movie solely made for people who just want to see gore. I thought Texans were supposed to be good with guns but this movie just shows scene after scene with absurdly poor gun use.,2022-02-19
"I went into this movie with very LOW expectations, given almost all TCM movies are garbage. I'm an avid slasher movie fanatic, so of course I'm gonna watch this.It starts off, of course, with not so awesome characters. One in particular seems to be a flaming lefty who hates guns, on account her sister was involved in a school shooting. She automatically attacks a man with a pistol on his hip, so she's annoying already.Instead of the usual ""hippie bus"" this time we see the protagonists drive a fancy Tesla. So, sort of cool new take I guess. They stop at the gas station, meet the weird towns people (per usual) and go on their way.This film touches on gentrification. The Gen-Z kids are buying an abandoned ""ghost town"" in Texas, where our beloved Leather Face has been staying quiet for the past 50 years. The movie went a completely different, new direction, which I think viewers either loved or absolutely hated. Personally, I liked it. Every other TCM has the same plot. Young kids stumble upon a town where EVERYONE is a part of Learherface's murdering habits. This time around, it's not quite so. Which is fresh and less annoying.The leads are super annoying yet become sort of likable half way through. I wasn't convinced though, that I wanted any of them to survive. They tried to give us Texas, however again, not convinced. Honestly the main location looked like the backlot of Warner Brothers (gotta go to understand). We definitely got Chainsaw! Holy chainsaw. And for sure we have a Massacre at its pure definition.This movie has a new wave to the series. I am excited to see the next one. All I'm gonna say is BUS SCENE. That scene proves that we are idiots always on our phones and not in reality. It's a mock of the younger generation as though all they care about are likes and follows. Which turns into them being ripped apart. It's awesome.Gore - 10/10 (extreme)
Acting - 9/10
Story - 7/1 (eh)Watch it if you want some intense gore!!Love the blue text for credits. Really cool and fresh for this series.OH and watch after the credits ;) will there be a second one? 🤔",2022-02-20
"I have never been a Texas Chainsaw fan, but I like some of the movies. The remake that was made in 2003 is still the best. This was just not the Chainsaw that I know it to be, from the beginning I did know that this is going to work. Fred Alvarez feel and his way of making a horror movie, it had it, but the director didn't made this movie into the best Chainsaw movies I have ever seen.In the beginning, like I said, I saw too much color and vividness, every time I have watched a good Chainsaw movie, they had a darkness in it. I just saw so much of happiness and joy in the first outing of the cast. The cast wasn't that memorable, except the Texas lone star I. The beginning, I did find him to be interesting. But with Sarah Yarkin and Elsie Fisher in the lead, I just didn't find nothing that got me invested to them.The runtime if this movie is mostly the same as the first 1974 movies and that's very cool, but this is the year 2022 and you need some more concept to get me invested to the characters. I knew that the Elsa Fisher character had a back story, but they didn't flesh in out, so that I could feel something towards the character.It had a few things that made me cringe (witch is a good thing) and I had a laugh in it (that scene was really funny), but there was nothing that I got invested in the end.",2022-02-18

"The only entertaining part is the bus scene... Besides that it's easily the worst film in the franchise, characters that aren't memorable, poorly portrayed story and the worst part is the incorporation of todays society focusing to much on the issues that lie in America today. The originals focus was all about the killer, he was fascinating, deranged and amazing. The original cast felt perfect and had actual emotion and depth... But this was basically just the complete opposite, all original horror films lately have met the same fate of today, modern directors ruining classic franchises, don't watch.",2022-02-19
"I don't leave reviews but this movie was garbage. This has to be satirical right? Idk I would recommend watching it stoned with friends. The writing was so bad, I don't want to offend the writers but come on you had to know what you were doing.",2022-03-24
"I'm losing track of how many times they've rebooted Texas Chainsaw Massacre now. Aside from the fun 2003 remake, the films just seem to get worse.This one promised to be different, even going so far as to bring back the original survivor from the 1974 original. It felt a bit like Halloween 2018, which was a box office hit, and not a terrible film.However, the trailer had one big red flag, that every movie connoisseur instantly recognizes as a warning sign: The Netflix logo.In other words: the script was going to be lousy, the production rushed and cheap, the acting and casting subpar, and most importantly, the movie would be ""safe"". None of the disturbing, traumatic stuff that made the original stay with you long after the credits rolled.Gone are the incestuous family, there's no trace of the horrifying dinner scene, the camera doesn't dwell on the lead character's eyeball as she screams in pure dread. Instead we get gore. Lots and lots of gore.They even go so far as to recreate a famous deleted scene from TCM 2 and then some with the bus scene. If there's one failing to the original TCM movies, it's that they never quite earned their title of massacre. This one does just that. The kills are creative, visceral, over the top splatter goodness straight out of an early Peter Jackson film.But as fun as they are, there's no other reason to watch this film. The plot is virtually nonexistent. Leatherface no longer has a family, which reduces him to the tired ""big strong guy in a mask"" trope. This is by far the film's biggest failing.One aspect that made the 2003 remake so successful is the fact that the family was interesting. Fully of quirky, disturbing characters which flesh out the world. R. Lee Ermey carried that film as much as the Jim Siedow carried the original. They were the twisted soul of their respective films, cunning and cruel, while Leatherface was their intellectually challenged attack dog.There's no room for subtlety in the new film though. Heck, there's hardly room for plot. Two plot setups go absolutely nowhere with one literally dumped in the trash.Another weird thing about these Netflix productions... why are so many of the main characters unattractive? Granted, these are supposed to be generation Z kids, but still, from a pure filmmaking perspective, a Jessica Biel fleeing from a masked killer in tight jeans and a wet shirt is undeniably more effective than two stubby gender studies students. There was neither enough meat to their characters, nor - absent good writing - meat to their bones in all the right places, to make the audience care for their survival. No slight against the actresses, they do their best with the material, but neither was a good choice for a final girl.Oh well, I after seeing the reviews for this one, I suspect the next remake is barely 2-3 years away.",2022-02-20
"Its gory, violent, and with great cinematography, helped along with fantastic sets. Like with most other slasher movie, there is no story or script to write home about. After watching the remake of Scream which was released around the same time, this was a breathe of fresh air. The franchise takes advantage of modern special effects, and looks amazing for a £20 million dollar movie. Its no masterpiece, and the original still shines brighter than all the sequels put together, but its a really good slasher movie despite the negative reviews. The production team deserve a medal. Scream, in comparison , cost 4 million dollars more, and had literally no special effects. I don't feel its found its place with the Netflix audience, who are more akin to watching romcoms. Sure, there was the in joke about the social media age, which was a bit out of place, which every horror movie seems to circulate around released in the past 10 years: at least its reason for existence, wasn't a cliched troupe, where the characters continually in-reference themselves, trying to figure out what makes a good horror movie plot. That was Scream the remake, and was highly unoriginal and boring: giving it romcom status. Fans of horror wont be disappointed.",2022-02-20
I wanted to shut it off after the first 5 minutes because the protagonists were so annoying. Then I decided to wait around to see if they died violent deaths. One of the few slasher movies where you cheer for the killer. If you're a native Texan you can identify with the problem of Californian hipsters and liberals flooding into texas and trying to change the culture.,2022-03-05
Normally I'm all for a good mindless slasher flick of stupid people dying stupidly but god damn this was bad in every aspect.With out a doubt wins the stupidest characters ever award and basing the main characters 'strength' on the fact she is a school shooter survivor is just extremely poor taste.,2022-02-20
"Actually a very weak attempt at a remake/re-imagining of the horror classic.A bunch of hippies in the original was one thing but a bunch of ""influencers"" in this film... well it was never gonna end well for these idiots then was it.And I'd love to know how you would charge a Tesla in that town...So, Leatherface would be in his 70's now but in this film he moves like an athlete with super strength and somehow still can't be killed.Usual cliches: talk first then forget to kill the killer as he walks right past you, never letting go of the past, 20 kids on a bus and they can't get the better of a old man carrying a chainsaw, film the killer and threaten to ""cancel"" him...These script writers are getting worse and horror these days just doesn't have the thrill/kill factor of the 70's genre.",2022-02-26
"5.4 seriously? This movie is excellent. With a fantastic argument this film is nothing behind other sequels I've seen. In fact, one of the best sequels for years now. The pace is amazing as the whole movie is brutal. A true reckoning for the fans of this serie. As I am. An amazing ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" version 2.2.",2022-02-18
"So this film is probably better than most of the recent outings in the series. It has the usual suspects of redneck cops and deranged parental figures(without them these films would be like hotdogs without mustard, I guess).There is a lot of gore and moments that tries its best to shock you, I can't really speak about the results since I am quite desensitized to that by now.I can say that I saw much potential in the opening of the film with the conflict with the southern ""hero""-guy, and a possible but not much delivered on redemption further down the line.Also the ""city""-characters also needed to redeem themselves quite a lot for being naive, stupid and self serving, one of the characters did deliver on this but I didn't really connect with her in any meaningful way.In many ways this is a carbon copy of the ""Halloween""-remake(sequel or what you might call it), with the original survivor dedicating her life to kill the monster that killed her friends and family.This aspect was like you can imagine a let down and only used as a call back to the original movie.The look of the movie is pretty cool at times and the score is great. They do a more music video style with the use of contrasting colors than the previous sepia tone brown and yellow drab.Oh yeah Leatherface is a T800, that is pretty much the only explanation for his survival during this movie.There is even a reference to T2 nearing that end that I found very amusing. Still it makes it hard to take anything seriously when the bad guy has more plot armor than Rey ""Skywalker"".All in all it is a okay slasher, much better than all of that ghost crap that gets made now a days.",2022-02-18
"Is this movie supposed to be funny? No.Is this movie funny? Absolutely, but in a bad way.ZERO story for this movie. ZERO horror. The ending is stupid and you can tell that they want to make a sequel to it.The only survivor from the first Texas Chain Saw Massacre movie, Sally Hardesty, came back in this movie. You thought it will going to be like the 2018 version of Halloween? No. They brought her back, and let Leatherface kills her this time. Duh.And they added some unnecessary elements for characters, like school shooting, BLM, etc.Successful horror movie series + violence + no story + poor acting + unnecessary background for characters = Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2022)",2022-02-19
"I've watched hundreds of horror films and this has to be one of the worst.The pacing of the film is comical, like a Benny Hill skit. Everything seems to be running at 1.25x speed, which is especially noticeable when there's meant to be tension (supposedly) building, or where there's water involved.The pacing seems to be the result of the writing/plot. There are so many sub-plots that just lead no where. Instead of cutting these to reduce time, key scenes are sped up and jump cuts are thrown in everywhere. No tension build as a result.Finally, the characters are shallow and absolutely abhorrent. I actually wanted them to die which is counter to what I should want during a horror film, I should be getting attached to the characters and building empathy and feeling the tension they feel on some level. Instead I was cheering leather face on as he butchered them.It might have been redeemed if it was campy, but this film takes itself pretty seriously and it's much worse as a result.",2022-02-22
"It captures the fast paced action and brutality of the original. Leatherface is out for blood, although he has a reason to want to kill in this version.In the original, young people live in an affordable Austin and go out for a leisurely trip to the country. In this one, young people are trying to escape the expense of Austin by building affordable businesses out in the country. Of course, their ability to move is made possible by IPhones and Tesla, which is exactly the reason they have to leave affordable Austin,Unfortunately, the affordable country of filming is Bulgaria, which says so much about the movie, the cost of living for young people, and the destruction of opportunity in Texas. It also says a lot about the lack of sustainability for large scale migration to rural America, unless you are a kid who has survived a school shooting.Much better than I expected,",2022-02-18
"This is one of those horror movies were you are rooting for the killer. Tha protagonists make no effort to survive. I was glad everytime someone got killed. Don't watch this. This is dumb. Texas chainsaw massacre was never a great franchise, but this one is particularly bad. I'm disappointed because the script was written in part by Fede Alvarez, the guy who did don't breath and the evil dead remake.The film also has this gentrification undertones which I didn't understand. I'm sure the people who made didn't understand it either.Whoever worked on this project wasted a couple years of their life.",2022-03-23
"It was trash and waste of time. Poor script poor acting. A woman got cut rapidly by chainsaw but still shot with a shotgun.A lady saw a man's face half cut, doesn't even react.A man stopped a moving bus God knows how???",2022-02-28

"The OG will always be the best, but for me this new one is the second best TCM movie we have gotten. WAY better than the terrible TCM 3D. Gory kills, decent story and it looks wonderful. Good atmosphere, kept the jokes mostly out of it. WAY better than I was expecting.I was expecting 3D levels of bad, but this was very enjoyable and the second best of the series imo.",2022-02-18
"I could only describe my experience with this movie.I was actually very pleased. I knew the movie was coming out sometime this year but I haven't seen any posters or trailers for it so I went blindfolded.And oh boy was it cheesy in parts.. but the kills, the gore, some of the acting (I meant Nell Hudson and just a little of Alice Krige who's face we've seen a lot in this movie *badum tss* )Don't expect anything new, just some sliced up teenagers who had it coming (who doesn't want to look at that on Friday night?)
Once again the kills were top notch, enjoyed every blood drop!(I'm sorry for some grammar issues I'm from Russia)",2022-02-18
"I am somewhat of a hardcore texas chainsaw fan, so I gave this a chance. My favorite is the 2003 version, can't watch it enough times. This one I almost shut off at the beginning with the horrible personalities of the characters, young disrespectful trust fund type kids. Melody/Sarah's character was hard to deal with, loud mouth girl who thinks shes tougher than any of the guys..after first 5min I knew it would be worth it to watch her die lol once the mother died things really kicked off..the way people were killed was so graphic. The actor who portrayed her son was great, I was crapping my pants during the chainsaw cellar scene where she just wouldn't roll out of the way..I was watching it on a 85"" tv immersed in a smaller room and I was literally crawling out of my seat at times. Give this movie a chance and you wont be dissapointed. I was pleasantly surprised and glad I gave it a shot. 6/10.",2022-10-30

"You heard what I said. After a disastrous run of putrid and shallow remakes, and a slew of cringeworthy sequels. We finally have what feels more like an honest direct followup to the original, classic original 70s masterpiece. Is it perfect? No. Will my opinion makes some of you fill with contempt? Yes. But I LOVE the original film, HATED the remake timeline, and never cared for the original sequels. This film is the first time that I feel like this brand is finally on track since the original. Where will it go from here, who on earth knows! Nothing can touch the original, so I am just here to enjoy the ride. Every film tied to this series is a unique vision of the material, and this is one of the most compelling yet. The original can't be beat, but this is a nice small and novel love letter. I'd LOVE to see another theatrical installment after this but Thank you Netflix.",2022-02-21
"I love horror movies and am quite a fan of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies. However, this movie was a waste of time to make and watch. The story line is all over the place and they tried to make that up by including an older character. It also took a lot of ""brutal"" murders from the newest Halloween movie and previous one. It was extremely predictable... No, seriously; you knew who was going to die and how. It's a solid NO for me... this is a movie to have on in the background while you're cleaning or something.",2022-02-22
"Where do I even start with this film? The script is beyond terrible and makes for a laugh out loud viewing. There are no jokes in this movie (other than the eye roll worthy ""you're gonna be canceled bro"" joke that is just beyond lazy writing), we are laughing at you movie, not with you. The actors do the best with what they are given, but this movie is just so poorly written that you will hate them all by the end.The movie follows four kids as they try to rebuild an old run down Texas town for financial gain. Right off the bat is an example of this movie's terrible writing because one of these four kids never has their name said or shown on screen. You would have to go to the internet or sit through the credits (lol) in order to find out her name is Ruth. The movie also reintroduces Sally, the only remaining survivor of the original movie. This film's attempt to rip off Halloween (2018) falls flat on its face as Sally is one of the dumbest and most pointless characters I can remember. The late Marilyn Burns is likely rolling in her grave after what the writers did to her character.It is a pretty well known trope in horror movies that the characters make bad decisions. So much so that Gieco made that parody commercial. This movie does that Geico commercial but unironically. My favorite is when the Richter character finds one of the dying kids and goes into the murder house without giving the bus keys back (which he confiscated earlier), a decision that leads to his own death as well as everyone on the bus. Then you have the stupid fake out ending that's been done way to many times by garbage horror movies that don't know how to end. It's terrible, not to mention that it happens during the day. Which begs the question, did they sleep in that town where all their friends died?",2022-07-04
Whoever picked these kids and wrote the script needs another job. Either way the first 5 minutes puts a sour taste in your mouth. Pushing the stereotype and gen z down your throats. The gas station encounter will make you want these kids to get slaughtered by leatherface. Every minute I'm just praying they meet their horrific demise. Unlike the other movies where I feel sorry for their mishap. These kids brought it to themselves.Edit added. The ending was well worth the cringe. The ending did not disappoint.,2022-07-15
"To really enjoy any movie you have to look past its flaws and the unrealistic stuff that happens.That being said doesn't excuse the absolute ridiculous ""physics"" in the movie. I mean did anyone else notice the sheer amount of boards and let's not forget the pipe that the chainsaw cut through like butter.Love the original, but these modern-day installments leave something to be desired.",2022-02-20
"Back in the day when we heard about a banned movie that was 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', this is basically what we imagined it would be (before it became available and we were all let down at how bad it was)! Heads and limbs coming off everywhere. Decent fun horror, don't listen to the negative reviews. It's a TCM movie and does exactly as it supposed to.",2022-02-19
"They threw everything against the wall, and nothing stuck. Like 5 movies in one, and they all suck. Subplots that go nowhere. Original was mortifying, walked out nauseated in the 70' before it was over. Never did that solely due to revulsion.",2022-02-20
"Not bad, nothing special. Basic characters, basic storyline and pretty predictable. The kills, however, were really great and some of them were very brutal and original.A decent movie that shouldn't disappoint, but at the same time probably won't be overly memorable. Definitely better than the last few!",2022-02-19
"There was a time when Leatherface was up there with slasher greats like Freddy, Jason, and Michael. But it feels like the last time this franchise had any relevancy was the remake in 2003 and maybe the prequel to the remake in 2006. Since then we've had a lousy 3D sequel, a straight to video prequel, and whatever this movie is (clocking in at just 81 minutes).I can forgive a lot...like filming a movie set in Texas in Bulgaria with a cast of Zoomers that have all the appeal of lemon juice poured on paper cuts. Or a spry 75-year old Leatherface being able to run after, keep up with, and slaughter teenagers/young adults. Or dispatching a legacy character with no respect or reverence at all.But what is with all the characters not behaving like normal human beings at any time? Such as:
-not undoing your seatbelt earlier, and making a run for it when you have the chance.-hiding under a bed and then staying there when someone else is being attacked, and you have more than enough time to escape?-an entire group of people running to the back of a bus to slowly get chainsawed by one person, even though there were more than enough opportunities to sidestep/bypass Leatherface and run towards the front exit.-spending 50 years thinking about a revenge plan, and then making really dumb decisions, only to be killed in spectacular fashion.-not calling the cops or anyone else, after you ""defeat"" Leatherface, and just leave the town laughing and smiling (oh um, your friends and thirty other people are dead).-stay standing-up through the sun roof, after seeing your sister killed, so you can crash into a building or something.RIP Common SenseGarbage plot, garbage characters, and a limp, pathetic entry into this franchise that really needs to call it a day.",2022-02-20
"I have never been a fan of the Horror genre and especially ""Leatherface"" but decided to watch this one since it was recently released. I had expected that it would be somewhere closer to the ""Michael Myers"" saga but unfortunately no. It is a tragedy and pinnacle of degradation at the same time. The whole movie is not a Horror at all, it is a cheap quality fan-made movie. It is unbelievable that the whole movie, have not really scary moments but rather disgusting and stupid like literally from ""Scary Movies""This is really bad!",2022-02-21
"This starts out just like any other Netflix film you would expect by now. The plot is contrived and way out in left field. Were supposed to believe that this group of young kids with no money found investors to buy up some dried up ghost town in the middle of nowhere Texas, just to turn it into the very thing they are talking about getting away from. Leatherface (who is half the age he should be at this point) is set off into his rampage by his step mother dying, so he breaks out his chainsaw ,that for some reason has been concealed in the walls of the house for 50 years. They bring in Sally Hardesty who is supposed to be the only survivor of the original film for no good reason, ala Sarah Connor from Terminator. This angle is so played. She ends up being a pointless inclusion anyway, because after she spews her typical badly written revenge character lines, she winds up getting impaled by Leatherface and has her guts chainsawed into oblivion, yet somehow manages to still be alive long enough to hand her shotgun over to unlikeable character #2. All of the typical cat and mouse things happen as Leatherface chases after unlikeable characters #1 and 2. In classic trope fashion, they think they have killed him, but alas, they have not, so they give a good morning happy stretch, set their gps and decided to go home. Nevermind being involved in a murderous rampage and the town being strewn with dismembered bodies. At least Leatherface got annoying character #1 at the end. That part I liked.Go watch the original 1974 or the 2003 & 2006 films. They are the only ones worthy in this franchise. Now I must go and pay my newly increased Netflix bill as I try to figure out why I am still paying for this service.",2022-02-18
"Modern, fast-paced and brutal. Pays homage to the original.If you're a film junkie like myself then you'll appreciate the time and effort that David Blue Garcia and everyone else put in to make this happen.I enjoyed it. Not my place to say where it could have been improved. It is what it is.Thank you.",2022-02-18
"The only reason to watch this is for some decent gore. Unlikeable characters and non coherent story. I would only recommend it if you're a person who likes to watch crap slasher flicks. And people say 80's slashers are terrible. If so, why do they keep remaking them. If you watch and like it or think it's a great movie, good for you. Glad you enjoyed it.",2022-02-20
"This film could have been so much better, it was great it went back to the gory routes but it left so many questions.Like honestly if this was the original leather face, how did he manage to get to the building he was in?Also, why is it now in these movies they make people so stupid. Like so many bad decisions that don't make any sense and just leave you confused.For example, why did the bus driver leave the bus and said nothing to the people on the bus asking him not to open the door.Why on the bus when leather face was cutting up these people, did one girl go to run away but still had her phone in hand recording?When the only survivor from the first Texas chain saw massacre shows up in the movie and has leather face sitting on the bed, unarmed, why did she let him leave and go outside to attack the girls before she decided to shoot him?This movie leaves you shouting at the tv, enraged, as you just question everyone's bad decisions.I understand that in horror movies, we watch and all go ""why did they do that, I wouldn't do that"" as that's the idea...but this was on a next level.",2022-02-19
"The plot of the movie was basic, just like every other TCM movie. The characters were very interesting, but not well-developed. The casting and the acting were great. The filming location of the movie was really good and very creepy (especially, Leatherface's house). The highlight of the film was, THE KILLS, they were astonishing and super brutal. The cinematography of the movie was really good. Also, I have to admit that I really enjoyed how fast paced that movie was. So intense and a wonderful killcount. Overall, it was an unexpectedly nice movie and probably the best movie of the franchise so far. Moreover, it totally deserves a sequel. Last but not least, the ending scene was so unexpected, it was shocking. Anyway, nice job!",2022-02-21
"The characters are unlikeable and they do nothing for the film. The only good things are the gore and leatherface but leatherface seemed a bit immortal for the movie. He came back at the end for a final jumpscare when he already ""died"". Leather face just seemed like one of the only human kind of killers that can be killed easily but it felt like he was more like jason.even at one point it looks like he teleports.The best scene is clearly the massacre on the bus. It is gory and the filming for the scene is really good.All in all its not a great film but leatherface was casted well and the new look is awesome.",2022-02-23
"To come here disappointed even though I came watching without having much expectations just means it's really horrible. I have watched a lot of classic horror movie remakes but this one just stinks. They did the franchise dirty and so as the 50 year survivor from the original. There wasn't even one good or memorable character from this movie. I guess what they're trying to do is pull a ""history-repeats-itself"" theme but unfortunately, it didn't work even a bit. Total waste of time. Not recommended.",2022-03-12

Not much boring conversation and go straight to killings it was interesting and watchable overall good movie and I'm glad it's not a long movie tho it jumps into conclusion fast that's what I like about this movie, thumbs up. First gore that has a good storyline and watchable besides Wrong Turn 2021.",2022-02-20
Netflix has absolutely insulted this amazing horror series by just shooting out another political agenda nightmare of a movie. It's almost comical to the point. Tried to watch the movie for hopefully at least some good kill scenes and what a disappointment that was. An absolute nightmare of a film and I don't mean that in a funny good way.,2022-03-01
"This movie on paper should be a home run, then comes the stupid scenarios the scriptwriters put the characters in and unfortunately it all comes undone....so forgettable. There are some great effects and some interesting kills but on a whole this movie lacks the stewardship of competent and meaningful writing and movie making, the plot is ludicrous and the decisions made by the characters leave a whole lot to be desired. This movie needs intensity and menace coupled with a whole heap of tension, of which there is little. Dropping characters in an unlikely situation and basically giving them no motivation to do anything makes this simply a film to showcase some good effects and gore porn. Watch but don't expect the lasting effect of the original, part 2 or the 2003 remake because it doesn't do anything to further the backstory or explain the leatherface mythos. Not sure how this franchise survives so many lame incarnations, I understand the horror genre isn't the pinnacle of cinema, but I really appreciate it when filmmakers approach this type of intellectual property and take it seriously and give it some gravitas. I'll keep my fingers crossed it will happen some day, until then this is about on par with what you'd expect from a ""straight to netflix"" movie.",2022-02-19
"Now, I know what everyone is thinking: ""Here's a review that is just gonna do the opposite of what everyone else is writing."" Well, you're kind of right. The movie starts out with a certain woke agenda, pushes hard, but then does a 180 towards the middle and then everyone forgets, because, who cares! Gimme the blood! The film also pokes fun of current culture in a great scene that takes place on a bus. Woke? Deep South? Man? Woman? It doesn't matter when you're staring at the end of a buzzing chainsaw.Personally, I would say this is akin to the remake of ""The Evil Dead,"" as far as the violence goes. The ending is just what you wanted, but a little more.Don't listen to everyone else: if you wanna watch a great gore fest with characters you don't have to like, check it out.",2022-02-21
"I had NO idea how much I would enjoy a Leatherface characterization that basically paints him as an angry boomer attacking a bunch of virtue-signaling, entitled zoomers, but here we are. Sure, it's so stupid and simple that it's barely a movie, but it's also mercifully short and so full of effective scares and kills, it ultimately stands as an entertaining bit of gore trash.",2022-03-03
"I didn't love nor hate the movie. But it didn't feel like it was a true Texas chainsaw movie to me. The characters made too many dumb decisions and too many times I had to say ""Oh come on!"" At the screen.And the ending 60 seconds was just stupid. I mean we all know they like to leave the option open to keep the story going but to kill her like that was just dumb in my opinion.I will say I loved the kills, they were nice, intense and gory and that bus kill scene was probably my favorite out of the TCM series.There is a end credit scene but nothing happens.",2022-02-19

"Much sawspoon in the air when entering this rather endaring netflix massacre movie, a mist of blood spreading bloodborne disease within a quater of a mile is just the least of concerns. Its can now easily be pronounced that netflix virginity as a safe and sound film site has been lost, simply because the graphic violence is crudly and utterly grotesque, and the grumpy old mans guts have been turned upside down many times outta disbelief and subnoxious fright. Ive seen a few of it kin over the years but this was some of the worst massacres ever filmatized in a safe environment, and let that be my warning if youre fainthearted or just a bit more sensible than your friend sitting next to you,you can avoid this if you want to.Its a pitty though that it has a gloomy glow of good sets and filled with gadgets just like cut outta a texas tourism brochure that makes this a film that should be seen. The story and acting is what you expect according to the conseptual recipie, the score cuts deep into your groins, and as a blood and gore horror film it fulfill most of the genres criterias, even the grumpy old mans so its just like a sword it has two safe side and a cutting edge, hard to recommend.",2022-02-20
"This new iteration is such a confused mess that it doesn't make sense as a true sequel to the 1974 classic. Per example: how can Leatherface (who's supposed to be over 70) has the agility of a 50 year old man ?!What I found the most ridiculous is the bunch of influencers in the bus: they're taking pictures of our favorite chainsaw-wielding psycho with their S-M-A-R-T phones. What I would've done is to run away (yes, run away like in Monty Python's holy grail), not standing there like an idiot. Also, the ending is so predictable that it made me regret to have watched that movie, which I'll never see again.Finally, I'd like to thank the filmmakers for butchering one of my beloved franchises to pieces. A friendly advice: stay far, far away from that grotesquerie.",2022-03-25
"I'm disappointed.... This movie doesn't deserve the name. The cast is for me so unlikeable that I wanted to see them dead! What happend to leatherface???? He sets traps, he survives like 10 shots from a shotgun....... I hope Netflix never makes a tcm ever again......",2022-08-06
"Absolutely appalling. Apart from a few decent kills, its totally ridiculous. Leatherface has turned into Jason and the 70+ year old senior runs around like he's in the WWE killing hipster student types.Only saving grace is that the Atmos soundtrack and score is great. At least the 3D one had Alexandra Daddario in it.",2022-02-18

This one will give you nightmaresSide note: To all of you giving good horror movies such low scores; what is wrong with you?! Do you get into these movies just to give them bad reviews? You KNOW what you're getting into, why do you even watch them? Love to hate?",2022-02-21
"Well started out good! Another Netflix movie, which is actually better then todays Hollywood crap. Hollywood, which has become so woke and un original/predictable just kills remakes. Netflix is willing to take script chance in a Tarantino way, which the remake of T C M was done. What I like about T C M is they go woke and turn it up side done with the very woke characters. The lead characters are rich and woke in everyway to develop the characters un likability. The feel good, post a picture, self righteous indignation characters are self righteous indignation unlikable . The characters are plunged into the heart of (Trump country) white rural American. A dying county with people scraping by who just want to work a go home. The Woke rich city world collides with the poorer people of dying county. This ot to be good I laughed as I watched. Well T C M has a story were Dante and friends could of taken a few non verbal cues that some people are trying to help them, instead of judging them with Woke outrage. Being good at marketing, computers etc does not make you better than others just your in your given gifts was a faint theme. The open gun comment, which the character does not understand about snake country is well done. Watching the first half I thought this will be a great film . Well the second half starts with a small warnings, the cops seeing the potential problem before it starts, and the mechanic which they met and insulted cold be of help is ignored. Slogans, ideology meets the real world. A confederate flag flashes into the apex of avoidable trouble. Maybe, it's a Duke of Hazzard thing vs you hicks are in the of us making money issue. Like many horror movies a character arrogantly pushes events into trouble. Symbolism, and righteousness which lacks empathy/self absorption runs into Leather face. Regrettably the second half runs into grade B un believable horror movie cliches. Not to ruin the film but mean tweets, etc will not help the wokesters, while the toxic masculine character which the crew though little of is not around anymore I got the message. First half I give and 8, the second half a 3. (Second half is like a Slaughter high style film) T C M remake is 6 scares. Worth watching once.",2022-02-20
"Really?! The movie was fantastic, an excellent continuation of the '74 original. It was nice to see Sally Hardesty again...the film may have some flaws, but since the original this was for me the best made. The scenes are very real and it manages to impress us. This movie held me from beginning to end, it managed to cause me fear and discomfort. The actors were fantastic, their interpretations were not at all forced and they manage to pass on to the general public all the terror that they pass on. Leatherface again proves to be a villain that doesn't go out of fashion, he was great here. Netflix is to be congratulated for the film, in my perspective risked and very well! For horror lovers I am sure you will enjoy it very much!",2022-02-21
"Should be cast into the fires of mount doom. I'm sitting here trying to figure out how this screenplay was green lit for such an historical franchise.

"So let me get the positives out of the way. The violence, gore, and overall look of the movie is actually pretty great. It's the most gruesome out of all the TCM's. But the the rest of the movie is a disaster. Stupid added plot points that make no sense, no likeable characters except for the misunderstood redneck. I still can't believe someone wrote this script, submitted it to the studio and the damn thing got approved.",2022-02-28
"I honestly hope to see more in this piece of trash. Emo Girls? Seriously? That was a total display of bad hair. Leatherface had a family he was not adopted, remember the grandpa in the original version? Well, the story has been changed in the most stupid way. The only thing I enjoyed was the slaying of the influencers in the bus (LOL) And Sally Hardesty was a terrible end (Is not fair that she could scape back in the 70s, chase Leatherface for over 3 years and then finally been killed by him)- so so STUPID.

The sets are great, directing is great but it doesn't invoke a feeling of dread or horror.Novice horror fans will leave this feeling ok or worse while newcomers might actually be frightened. It's a good effort but doesn't quite hit where it's suppose to.",2022-02-18
I absolutely love cheesy dumb movies for what they are but this was physically painful to sit through. Now I've seen the original quite a few times and as well as it's multiple reboots and sequels and by no means are those good movies but compared to this it might as well be gold. There is genuinely not a single enjoyable moment in this movie. If you have even the slightest bit of self-respect you'll avoid watching this movie at all costs.,2022-02-19
"This leather face to me is one of the most intimidating in my opinion, at least since Texas Chainsaw massacre a new beginning. The gore was a lot of fun and there were one or two decent jump scares. My biggest issues are the acting and how certain characters survive their injuries. Especially when you have a chainsaw that has gone all the way through you and you are held up in midair yet magically still have enough strength to fire off two shots. And the ""Survivors"" are just not credible to me. But decent job with making leather face haunting and just an all around badass.",2022-04-04
"2022's Texas Chainsaw Massacre ranks as one of the best originally produced horror movies by Netflix. However, that title isn't as impressive as it may sound as most Netflix horror movies are average or of poor quality. With this film, you'll get what you expect from this series with a few original adaptations such as Leatherface on a bus with yuppies. At a runtime of only 80 minutes, the film maintains a fast pace that prevents boredom and keeps you interested. Although towards the end, you do feel that the film has started to run out of tricks. The exception to this statement is that the last minute of the film is the best possible ending. Along with the film's fast pace, there are other positives such as decent suspense, gruesome deaths, and a great setting with the town of Harlow. Although this film isn't as good as the original, I appreciated that the amount of screaming in this film is kept to a manageable level. While the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre is still one of the best horror movies of the 1970s, I think we can all agree that there was way too much screaming in the second half of that film. Unfortunately, there are still some noticeable flaws with this 2022 sequel. The main weakness is that all of the characters are either forgettable or annoying. This includes original final girl Sally. Sally was always a weak final girl like Alice from Friday the 13th, rather than a memorable final girl like Laurie from Halloween or Ripley from Alien. Additionally, like all previous films in this franchise, this film has a very simplistic plot that could have benefited from more development. Overall though, horror fans should enjoy this 2022 sequel.Pros and Cons Summary+Fast paced+Some suspense and gruesome deaths+Classic setting and villain-Characters are forgettable or annoying-It doesn't reinvent the wheel, viewers have seen most of it before.",2022-02-19
This is the worst Texas Chainsaw film I have ever seen. It's too corny. The whole confederate flag thing was over done. The premise of the movie was terrible writing as wel.,2022-03-13
"I gave this a 1 because 0 wasn't allowed. This is 2022 no movie should be this bad. Terrible acting, graphics and sound. The time wasted on this disastrous movie is lost forever!",2022-03-01
If you are familiar with woke garbage horror movies as of late you can predict the entire movie from the weak setups to the garbage ending. Should have listened to people who said it's a big skip.,2022-02-20
"At this point, I can't even picture Netflix making any movie, or show for that matter, that doesn't have annoying ""political"" characters trying to prove a point. Movies would be so much better if the characters just acted NORMAL! Good job Netflix, you managed to screw up Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Save yourself the hour and 20 minutes and do literally anything else.",2022-02-22
"It's could of been written by anybody - extremely basic slasher movie.Best part - the title.No originality - no depth - nothing memorable,If this franchise was a weekly show - where leather face kills random people who come to town each episode - this is one of those standard filler episodes.",2022-02-18
"David Blue Garcia's effective and suspenseful sequel to Tobe Hooper's classic 1974 slasher film. It takes place some 50 years after the horrific events of the original film. The infamous hulking mass murder known as Leatherface, chillingly played by Mark Burnham in a wordless performance, has been in hiding all these years in the deserted town of Harlow, Texas which is in the middle of no where and has only two residents. An old lady Mrs. Mc that use to run a local orphanage, superbly played by Alice Krige, who looks after Leatherface as her son, and the other is a tough guy mechanic named Richter, marvelously played by Moe Dunford. The new owners of the town are group of young idealistic friends and entrepreneurs named Dante, Melody, and Lila, superbly played by Jacob Latimore, Sarah Yarkin, and Elsie Fisher, who have just arrived with the hopes of revitalizing it, they have a busload of big money investors arriving in just a few hours to see it. But when they get into a serious argument with Mrs. Mc about her still occupying her old orphange home that leads to her having a heart attack, things will take turn for the worse. Leatherface will go on a murderous rampage looking for revenge and whoever he can cut to pieces with his chainsaw. Good direction by Garcia, striking cinematography by Ricardo Diaz, and proactive editing by Christopher S. Capp, but what really works for this well-crafted horror film is the shocking and intense violence and gore, as well as the nail-biting action sequences. No masterpiece here for sure, but a good entertaining and bloody horror show. Recommended. Now streaming on Netflix.",2022-02-20
"It's a good thing that the movie only lasts for an hour and 14 minutes, so there's not way too much suffering for the audience. But if you can - skip this movie. Boring, predictable (almost every step), killer can't be killed no matter what you do to him (apparently he's not human... idk)... you'll just waste your time with this movie.Plus, acting is bad (especially by Leatherface himself). Victoriously waving that chainsaw for no reason, being ""proud"" of killing teens... I know it's all scripted and the actor had to do it, but it simply makes no sense.4/10 - and that's me being generous.",2022-02-28
"The movie itself was pretty refreshing to be honest but it wasnt anything special as expected of many ,,gory movies"". They are just made for fun and it sure did live up to that. Also i cannot even express how much i laughed at the end when Melody got pulled out of the car LMAO.",2022-02-18
"I wasn't expecting top of the line art on this film. After all, it's a Netflix adaptation of an old horror franchise. However, I'm an adult white male with a 12 year old's sense of humor, so I figured this would be right up my alley. NOPE!Unfortunately, this was insultingly bad for any real horror fan with a semblance of a brain. The writer should be covered with tar and feathers, and run out of town. The characters are so unrelatable. Their actions, motivations, interactions. It makes the early 2000's chainsaw films look like Christopher Nolan films.The best comparison I can make is that it's like thecc Fast and Furious franchise that just does the most outrageous stunts possible, even though is so obviously ridiculous, and physically impossible. Some people might like that sort of thing, but TCSM franchise was never like that. It was more realistic, and played on our fears of hillbilly psychos out in the country where nobody is going to help. This was just making fun of young kids with their phones.I won't give away the plot (because who cares). Just a couple of the million errors. Leatherface was much too young of an actor if we are doing it in modern day. The chainsaw he used had magical powers. Meaning it could literally cut through anything as fast as he could move it. Floor joists, bus metal, bodies, whatever (that type of magic chainsaw didn't exist in previous films). My favorite error was at the end. One person was alone in a car while Leatherface was in chase. She got up, and stuck her head out of the sunroof to look back at him. The car continued driving, and even took turns around corners. Who is driving the car around corners, when she's the only one in it away from the wheel?It appears this film was going for the modern, ultra gore and stupid story type of feel you get with the Hatchet series, but didn't pull it off at all. Hatchet is meta take on 80's overkill goofy gore. This was just a bastardized excuse to use the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" brand. It earned 3 stars because the cinematography and actors where good. They just had garbage material to work with.",2022-02-22
"When watching a horror movie, you accept the characters do not make the best decisions that lead to their demise. If one is going to accept the plot of this movie you are accepting that everyone in this movie has no common sense at all and are basically stupid. The ending is predictable, but by then you won't care.",2022-03-03
"Ok, here goes ...
Acting, good.Story, predictable (but it's Texas Chainsaw Massacre!!!! What do you expect??)
Originality, see above.Effects, very good.I'm a fan of the franchise and all but two have been utter crap. This is NOT utter crap. It ain't brilliant, but I've seen a lot LOT worse.Some of these reviews make me laugh ! What were you wanting to see ? Olivier play Hamlet ?Listen guys, just watch it, it's a good addition and corny as **** but like I say..... what do you expect. ?",2022-02-18
"As far as I am concerned this one is neither the worst nor the best of the entire franchise.However from my point of view, this is utterly a total waste of both time and energy!So my opinion? A SOLID NO
it's not even worth watching at all. The plot could have been much more rational and logical,however, all the characters were absolutely plastic and they didn't even make sense to me lol.",2022-02-19
"A ok sequel to the original, the call backs to past events was good, bringing the character of Sally back was great.Some of the characters were annoying but overall a enjoyable movie.",2022-02-20
"I almost stopped it 30 minutes in after being bombarded with all the idiotic wokeness of these know-nothing children. But I stuck with it, my only solace knowing that most of these characters would die horrible deaths and I would enjoy every second of it. The texan was the only good character, and the only one I wanted to survive. I was almost disappointed when the worst of the worst, the afro girl, seemed to have survived only to get it in the final scene in glorious fashion. So they have truly turned leatherface into a hero now. Awesome. It actually deserves a higher rating so I padded my rating a little to help it. In actuality id give it a 6 or a 6.5.",2022-02-21
"How dare they destroy a classic like Texas Chainsaw Massacre only to conform and make the ""woke"" society happy. If you want to indoctrinate people with your woke ideologies, do it in a documentary and leave it out of the horror genre. If I were to have one advice, it would be to watch the original movie (1974) or the remake with with Jessica Biel (2003) both true horror films.",2022-02-21
"Probably one of the worst movies I have seen.After like 10 minutes of the movie I already saw what this was heading to...When I watch a movie I dont need someone to bang my a** with political correct context all the time, specially in a movie like this. I want to see horror, blood, gore.Makes no sense the ""polution"", ""guns"", ""school shooting"", etc etc.I watch documentaries for that, why bring that stuff to texas chainsaw massacre?Even worse is the script, a couple of teleports, brainfart scenes like the buss one, all the.hardesty scenes, and the cherry on top of the cake was the last fight scene...No sense!!!Absosulely a mess. I dont know who had this idea and who let it go that way, but they should do some jail time.",2022-02-23
I do not understand the bad reviews... Netflix go go go! Ding Dong! I really enjoyed it! Do not wait Oscar film in Horror! Maybe is a 5 minute B-movie scene but it really does not change the fact that it was a hell good ride! Well done!,2022-02-18
"Honestly I'm only writing this review because of how dumb each character was and thought to myself how the hell do two lesbians survive. Classic horror movie depiction on the characters IQ but yikes it annoyed me. Funny how the OG surviver from the first movie leaves the kids locked in the car like she's about to kill leather face, faces him and doesn't do anything. Brutal deaths but not as good as the original. 3 star just because it's TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE!! 6 stars missing because of character/story.",2022-02-18
"Really blown away by the high ratings for this movie. I'm a huge fan of the slasher movie genre, what the latest Halloween movies have done for Halloween, I.e expanded on the story added thrills and scares as well as descent kills, this movie has made a laughing stock to the Texas massacre franchise, our victims in this movie was so unlikeable and the fact that leather face had a legitimate reason to kill everyone hurt this movie, there we no shocks no surprises it was just over loaded with gore and not much else.If you're a true horror fine give this one a miss.",2022-02-20
"Let me start by saying this, there is zero character development in this movie... literally nothing. This in itself makes it near on impossible to really give a damn when the characters start being killed off.That being said, some of the kills are absolutely visually stunning and wont disappoint! The make up department did an incredible job ensuring the kills were as graphic as possible.I must say for me personally, leather face absolutely stole the show in this movie, and the sympathy you feel for him almost makes the ordinary characters feel like the villains. You almost want him to crucify everyone he comes across so he can seek revenge, which truth be told, he very much deserves! You can feel he is acting on pain in this movie, which is something you don't necessarily feel on precious instalments of the franchise.The acting is good, and the storyline is somewhat predictable. But as far as Netflix originals go, I would highly recommend this film!I will definitely be watching again!!",2022-02-19
It is so pathetic that we have to put all of these woke kids in movies and tv show these days. These are some of the ugliest girls I have seen in a horror movie and they seem proud of it. What happened to the days of good ol horror movies with hot looking women in them. That is what we want to see. Not these weird looking kids. If they had better people in this movie it would have been a lot better.,2022-02-19
"I really enjoyed this movie I thought it was very well done very tense very scary, good amount of gore. Liked the connections to the original, leather face was pretty believable as being the same character from the original movie, The only thing I don't like is the confusing timeline, The last movie we got called Leatherface was a prequel to the original, The one before that was called Texas chainsaw which was a direct sequel to the original,
this one is a second direct sequel to the original, so.................",2022-02-19
Only thing good about this is the gore. I don't even understand why they put the title on this movie. It could have been just titled something else and I would have felt better about it.,2022-02-22
Leather face is the hero in this one. It's a joy watching him kill the now mandatory cast of ugly girls and buff idiot guys. Hollywood definitely discriminates against attractive women these days.Ending is particularly satisfying.,2022-02-19
"Really, 40 people on a bus and they just lay down and let him kill them? Nobody even tried to rush him lololol, awful. They had a decent story going and then it's almost like they gave up.",2022-02-22
"Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2022) is not a great movie, and it pales in comparison with the original. But with that said, if you came to this movie for the kills. You will probably be satisfied, because this movies kills are vicious, bloody and creative. And there are a lot of kills in this movie. Leatherface kills a LOT of people in this movie, and the kills are incredibly fun to watch. I also think that Mark Burnham is a worthy successor to Gunnar Hansen. I know there have been many more Leatherfaces, but since this movie is basically a direct sequel to the original The Texas Chainsaw Massacre I am only going to compare thosse two portrayals of Leatherface. Leatherface is a beast in this movie. He is intense and scary. The acting is also above average for a horror movie. The social commentary in this film is not very good though. And it borrows way too heavily from Halloween 2018 in a lot of spots. Mainly the character arc of Sally Hardesty. If you came to this movie looking for a movie that matches the quality of the original 1974 The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, than dont bother with this one. But if you came to this movie for a bloody good time, then it delivers.",2022-02-18
"I could not believe what I was watching. It's not just an insult to the original. It's an insult to the genre.Contrived plot, fake set designs, unprofessional actors and the worst editing and rhythm ever.Sadly good gore is not enough for this movie to have a chance to please horror fanatics.",2022-02-27
"My Reaction / Review for Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2022): I watched Leatherface (2017) and I really liked it while most people don't so I have an open mind about this one too. Let's do this. Before watching I find the main idea weird: ''After 48 years of hiding Leatherface returns [...]'' Like how old is he? If he was in his 20s in the original he must be like 70? That's definitely weird. The teenagers don't seem interesting but this could change. Does that old lady live with Leatherface? Wow he broke this guy's hand and used it as a knife against him? That's sick. It seems like the fact that this old lady died, made Leatheface go absolutely bananas, I like it. Now it's time for his revenge. So the survivor comes back to help defeat Leatherface? Soungs good.That could be interesting. Leatherface looks like a beast. It seems like Leatherface is really sad about the old lady's death, probably was a mother figure for him. 40 minutes in and I can say it's good. Let's watch the rest. The way he broke the texan dude's leg, damn, that's graphic. I liked the texan dude, so sad Leatherface killed him. Please tell me that leatherface will go all terminator in that bus. Lol everybody is taking pictures of him, he is a superstar. Livestream with leatherface hahaha. And he did it, the texas chainsaw bus massacre, really disturbing scene. The way he killed Hardesty was cool. Wow I didn't expect that he would come back and kill one of the girls. Ok the end. I have to say that this movie is not as bad as people say.It's definitely not a masterpiece but it's not like absolute trash, it's ok, it's decent, nothing more or less. Most of the movie is pretty entertaining but towards the end it's not as good as the first 40 something minutes. My rating is a solid 7/10.",2023-06-01
"I just watched this movie and I thought it was surprisingly good.I watched it alone and parts of it scared the bejeepers out of me.Why in the world didn't they film it in Texas. Even so, I would recommend it to people who like slasher movies.",2022-03-31
"What to say about this movie... Terrible acting, terrible directing, cliche after cliche, absolutely empty characters, no setup for events to happen, they just happen out of pure coincidence every time.People get half their body cut with a chainsaw and they are still moving, talking, shooting. People see brutally murdered people and barely act surprised. Just a mess. The only good aspect of the movie is the mechanic guy's acting.Gore doesn't make horror. Not a horror movie but a horrible movie.",2022-07-19
This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I saw leather face get shot five times by a shotgun and then he goes underwater until the next day and still kills one of the main characters.,2022-02-22
"Words cannot evenexplain how much I DESPISE this movie. It does not make sense,not even a bit. They COMPLETELY mischaracterized Bubba,aka Leatherface and instead of learning and trying to understand his character more,they choose the explanation for his child-like behaviour that he was a kid in the original movie,which is pure bs since he acts this way since he's mentally impaled?!? So how the hell does a grown a$$ man end up in an orphanage?(the group photo of the ""kid's"" of theorphanage reads the year 1975. He was already an adult in the 1974 movie,which took place in the yr 1973,so why would he be there?)
The characters are painfully dumb,so much so,that there was not a single character that was new to the franchise and has died that I actually felt sorry for. Especially at the bus scene. Look,I understand that they wanted to go with the final girl plot,therefore they had to kill them off,but couldn't they have done it in a smarter way? Why don't they fight back against Bubba,who is clearly an old man by know?And the way they portray Sally too.... To put it simply,her reboot is also incredibly dumb. She had SO MANY chanses to kill off leatherface and ends up getting defeated by a chainsaw meanwhile she had a damn SHOTGUN!!!Also please someone enroll the writers in a damn science class so they can learn that after a chainsaw brutally f's up your organs,there is no way you could lift up a gun afterwards or even survive for more than a couple of seconds(Sally refrence). And Leatherface had so many other kills that were incredibly unrealistic,meanwhile this franchise is supposed to be built around realism,not damn fantasy,that is what's supposed to make it scary in the first place. To put it simply,this movie isn't even close to offering that.This movie is a complete joke and an embarassment to the frachise,easily one of the worst ones. I would honestly want to give it 10 stars,but that's not an option so I'm giving it a 1.",2023-04-25
What a disappointment. The script is predicable and recycled from previous outings. I would say its a Teen Slasher film but that would insult even that genre. Don't waste your time with this forgettable episode.,2022-02-22
"Every character is terrible, you hate all of them within the first 15 minutes. Very little of the movie makes sense, even for a slasher. The 2 protagonists should really reconsider their futures in acting.",2022-02-20
"Awful, nonsense and story, plot, characters
Never watched the original one
But this movie is wasted
One of the Netflix budget films and awful as usual.",2022-02-22
"Texas Chainsaw Massacre attempts to woo fans with their not so secretive Easter eggs for people to search for. If you are into horror movies for nothing but the gore then you'll probably enjoy this. Overall it was a lazy attempt of an installment on a franchise that just simply hasn't been able to come close to the original.In Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2022) they start you off with 4 characters who provide very little background of themselves. Their purpose of being in the film makes no sense and their purpose to their destination is simply lazy. The story of what truly happened to leatherface after all these years was non existent. In the original, you felt bad for Leatherface and you tried to have sympathy for him. There was character development which very much lacked in this.The kills, and gore was fine. People who crave the bloodthirsty will be satisfied but that should just about do it.",2022-02-19
"This is literally the worst movie I've ever seen in my ENTIRE life. This was a piece of garbage, the actors are mediocre, the script (is there even a script) is nonsense. I feel like my 10-year-old little sister and her friends made this movie at my country house with my dad's chainsaw and an iPhone.",2022-02-23
"I just don't understand some of the horrible reviews. Horror in general is always pummeled more than any other genre. It's unfairly maligned.What are people expecting? A masterpiece of cinema?This is a slasher horror, and it delivers in that regard.Gore? Check.Seemingly invincible villain? Check.Dodgy townsfolk? Check.Emotional backstory for its characters? Check.Troubled teens? Check.Cheesiness? Check.A bit of humour? Check.It's like every reviewer is Alfred hitchcock.The movie isn't perfect. But I thoroughly enjoyed it. Its not something I'd watch when I'm in the mood for a gripping, intellectual viewing. But I was bored, tired and this movie hit the spot.Yes, there's some dumb scenes.The heroine and her actions are a bit silly. I'm not going to spoil anything but something she does baffles me. I was screaming WHY, WHY! But apart from that, I can't really complain.They've took a classic and kept a lot of the old, grittiness and also added a slight modern twist.I'm far away from being in the loop of today's pop culture and society. I struggle with even the most mundane of modern technology but I didn't mind the film showing a bit of today's world. A big juxtaposition of yesterday and today and it works.If the original came out today, if others like Halloween, Friday the 13th etc were released today, they would also be met with the same treatment.I think people just expect too much from horror.Grab some nachos or popcorn and a large glass of cold cola, switch your brains off and enjoy a stupid, gory blood fest.If you like classic, silly, gory horrors, give it a watch. I'm sure you won't hate it.",2022-05-16
This film was so bad!!! Omg! Please use your free time on something else. What a waste of time. One of those movies where you're constant slapping your forehead and rolling your eyes. So bad.,2022-02-26
This movie makes me want to punch myself in the face. I think Its probably the worst movie I've ever seen and Id rather watch Teletubbies on repeat for the rest of my life than watch this ever again! Honestly do not waste your time.,2022-02-19
"Bunch of zoomers go to gentrify a Texas town. They then proceed to get hunted down by Leatherface, after taking his home from his mama. The following scenes play out: zoomers start TikTok streaming Leatherface, saying famous lines like ""you're gonna get cancelled bro"", as he stands there with a chainsaw in hand, wearing the face of his mother. A sheriff who knew Leatherface talks about how ""he's back"", as if he's some curse. Then instead of insuring the safety of two young girls, she goes Rambo to go kill him, but instead just lets him walk past to... Create more tension? Several close kills happen as the sheriff fires at him, proceeds to get cut right down the middle, somehow still conscious and alive then distracts him again, and then he for some reason goes into hiding, leaving the girl to have a 1 on 1 talk with the sheriff, where the sheriff says, ""he will haunt you"", and the young girl decides to then go Rambo. The young girls sister somehow dislodges a metal rod from her leg, and escapes a car; her sister at the same time gets dunked in the water by a 8 foot behemoth of a man, and Leatherface somehow loses her, then the car girl jumps on Leatherface's back to distract again... It's getting tiring at this point... The girl is about to die, the other girl distracts with a gun shot to save car girl, car girl then gets the chainsaw and slices him up the chin. They both escape in a self-driving car, and as it self-drives away they somehow manage to crack jokes and drive into the sunset, right before Leatherface drags one girl out of the car and slices her head off, with the other self-driving away, screaming.New age zoomer culture meets a classic. I don't know how anyone can sit down with a script and say to themselves, ""TikTok, zoomers, gentrification, racist southerners, self-driving cars, and a serial killer"", yeah this sounds great. It felt like a parody, like the ""Scary Movie"" series, but sadly not funny, nor even tried to be.I can't wait for the sequel to have Leatherface become LGBTQIA+ and cancel the girl for using a gun, preaching that guns are bad and America has a gun problem.",2022-03-04
"...if they didn't try to link it to the original.Once you realize this movie is attempting to tell you the original Leatherface and the original Sally are both making appearances here, all logic is gone out the window.Let us play devil's advocate for a second and assume that Leatherface was 16 in the original (which he very clearly wasn't)...are we actually meant to believe that a 66 year old man is doing all these insane feats of strength and dexterity? And that Leatherface's family in the original wasn't his actual family (which again, it very clearly was)?This movie would've had a better chance if they just made him a copycat killer.",2022-02-27
"Netflix tries to breathe new life into an old franchise and fails on every front.Keeping this as spoiler-free as possible, the writing is subpar. New characters are excruciating while a legacy character is wasted. All the attempts at humor fall flat.CGI effects are overused. How difficult would it be to film a guy's head popping out of a sunflower field? They decide to use CGI instead.Per my title, I can't figure out what they spent the $20 million budget on. Maybe they accidentally added an extra zero.I would suggest skipping this one. Definitely not worth subscribing to Netflix over.",2022-02-18
Guys I genuinely don't understand the hate. It seems people went in wanting to hate this movie. I keep seeing people say it's a woke movie but it's the complete opposite lmao. It's anti woke and takes a dig at cancel culture. This is one of the better movies in this franchise. I noticed a trend with the hate too. Most people crapping on this movie like the 2017 leather face movie even though that is a terrible movie. For those that didn't watch this movie yet. Just watch it and see do you like it yourselves and don't listen to others. I won't say this movie is perfect but it's sure as hell not as bad as some people are making it out to be. Like guys. It's a movie about a guy who kills people with a chainsaw. And it delivers lmfao you just can't seem to win with this generation. They whine and complain and go in looking to pick a movie apart. Don't go in Hating it before you see it. If you watch it with no expectations and aren't trying to look for a reason to hate it you might just like it.,2022-02-21
"Beautifully filmed, solid cast, and amazing grotesque kills; I understand the hate with the other aspects. Maybe the issue with this one is it's not based around a house in Texas like the others were this is the only one in town and farm land plus the dialogue could've been better! I think Elsie Fisher is perfect I'd love to see her in more I've only seen her exceptional performance in Eighth Grade. The horror is spot on for sure definitely nailed it in that department even gets better as goes on with style, beauty in most colorful way and some of the best horror ever!!",2022-03-11
"A pleasurable experience but for the wrong reasons, as first time found myself rooting for the killer all the way through. The protagonists in these movies it seems are becoming more useless and lucky which sports the feeling of, they don't deserve to live, which isn't what the film was going for but its what you get with this poor kind of generic character development.",2022-02-19
"This movie has everything a TCM fan would ask for. My all time favorite horror film is TCM 1974. No other film has come close to it when it comes to slasher films. 2003 reboot was an impressive addition to the franchise. Anything that has been produced since has been sub standard work to say the least.Cut to TCM 2022. This film has everything I wanted from a requel. A bad ass Leatherface, a decent premise and a cast of actors that I really wanted to see slaughtered on screen. This film is about Leatherface. The deaths were gruesome and satisfying. The ending was great!I'm sure Tobe Hooper is smiling from above for this worthy addition to the TCM franchise. A heartfelt kudos to all involved and for giving us this awesome Leatherface saga!Ignore the PC and woke whiney babies. Enjoy the chainsaw gore.",2022-02-27
"Just intolerable. There's nothing to see here except a few laughs. I'm only giving a 2 because the special effects are fine, even though the deaths are just utterly silly and comical. This should be branded as a comedy, not horror. And... the race theme AGAIN. I can't stand this anymore, it's getting very boring, every new franchise film has to be ""woke"" (yeah, I know you don't like the word but, it is what it is).",2022-02-22
"The story of this movie is really bad, but the goriness and the brutality done by Leatherface made me convinced enough to give 7 stars. I think this is the best Leatherface have ever played. His appearance is really terrifying, freaky, and brutal.Story: 3/10
I don't like the story. It's really silly and stupid. It's very predictable and the ending was bad. It's just focused on the leatherface and how he brutally slaughtered people.Acting: 9/10
The acting's really good, especially Leatherface and Lila (the final girl). The old Leatherface played by mark burnham is really great. I was speechless when i watched him murdered people inside the bus. That's the goriest scene i have ever seen in horror movies.Ending: 6/10
It was predictable how the ending was going to end. I didn't really like it. The director could've make a better ending. Honestly i really want to review the ending deeply but i don't want to spoil it.Cinematography: 8/10
This movie's very dark and brutal. I really like how the director mixed the modern and classic texas abandoned city. The gore and blood splatters are the best thing in this movie. I enjoyed it so much ignoring the plot.Overall: 6.5~7/10
In my opinion this is the second best Texas chainsaw movie. The first was the original and this movie follows the lead because of the gore, the graphics and obviously the Old Learherface.",2022-02-18

If you came to this movie expecting it to be anything other than garbage then you'll be disappointed. It's not the worst movie of the last ten years but it's not great. Plenty of decent gore. Ridiculous plot. Redeemed significantly by the chainsaw uppercut.,2022-02-18

"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2022) follows Leatherface returning after 50 years to terrorise a group of friends in a remote Texas town. I was pleasantly surprised by this film and enjoyed it despite what the reviews said. I found it to be tense, fun and gory! However, some of the plot points could've been developed further and the film should've been longer.The score was immediately very eerie, which the set tone for the rest of the film. Although it didn't do anything too unique and the story wasn't too thought out, I was still thoroughly entertained and packed full of very tense moments.The characters aren't set up to be particularly likeable, but they weren't in the original either. There was one specific very intense character backstory which caught me off guard. Sally's return was fairly unnecessary, thought also exciting, and I really liked Leatherface's new look in this film. Lastly, in terms of characters, the 'relatable gen Z' parts of the dialogue came off as very cringeworthy.The film had quite good cinematography and I was quite impressed by the filmmaking as a whole! There were some cool shots and ominous colour palettes.Lastly, my favourite thing about this film was the gore. It was an absolute bloodbath and I'm so happy they didn't tone down the kills! The kills were intense and always caught me off guard. I loved the bus scene, it was chaotic and VERY gruesome. In addition, I liked the end scene which was so shocking and I appreciated how they recreated the iconic moment from the original.",2022-03-01
"Quite literally nothing happened in the hour and a half that is this movie. It could have been cut down to five minutes and it probably would have been an improvement. The general acting, plot, script and just about everything else reminded me of a bad Highschool play.",2022-04-15
"I overall enjoyed the film, the performances from some of the young cast, especially Elsie Fisher, and Garcia's direction and cinematography was brooding. Wasn't a huge fan of borrowing the legacy character aspect of the movie that has been done recently in 2018's Halloween and 2022's Scream. Sally's appearance had a lot of promise but added very little to the plot.Not a masterpiece, but we certainly weren't promised one.",2022-02-18

"The end credits should've opened for the movie... an embarrassing amount of people that got up after being completely annihilated... and the acting...? Yikes. An interesting take on a horror classic and continued plot line blend into one.The highlight was the slasher aspect of the film. Absolute 8/10 for gore, blood, and slashing if you can sit through being able to predict what comes next, pick out the foreshadowing and double entendres, and too many repetitive camera shots.",2022-05-12
"This is by far the worst TCM- the story line is ridiculous, the actors fail to draw even minimal interest and the kill scenes just didn't do anything for me. I love nearly the entire franchise, I even enjoyed the more recent Leatherface, with TCM 2 being my favorite. This movie sucks very bad. The first what seemed like half hour was littered with social justice messages; long period of time trying to either remove a confederate flag from a building, discussing the removal, school shooter victim, black guy pulled over by cops. You can't make this stuff up, I guess that's why I try to distance myself from modern horror. No cool story line, no jaw-dropping moments, no incredibly hot actresses, or good actors. Junk.",2022-02-27
"Nobody wants to take time anymore to make a decent movie with just a normal plot. Of course you have to have your white shaming, the police shaming and yea all of that etc. I only give the 2 stars because of the death scenes and he was pretty gruesome. Every pop up you expected happened, and every place you expected him to be he would be. It's just disappointing that we keep ruining the saga of one of the most legendary horror slasher films of all time. It was very fast paced and the character development was horrible. So yea just another forgettable movie to the saga :(",2022-02-19

But that doesn't make him invisible to shotguns, chainsaws, and death.",2022-03-01
"This movie will piss you off slaright away for you to press dislikes button this has unlikeable characters, actors are just horrible choices of actors to pick is like lead girl Sarah Yarkin terrible looks, terrible acting just boring bland girl she is her acting is like Box like an empty Box just saying what is is in Box??? Just empty Box that's her acting I thought she was just boring look, boring actress nothing to her personality theirs nothing to her character at all it's maybe that's how she is written. I thought movie was too rushed and trying soo hard to be a Nostalgic as it can be like 2018 Halloween that movie is done better then to this garbage film. Also stupid silly script, if you extremely loved Texas Chainsaw Massacre original this is related to that but you will be raged and pissed off with film completely out raged like you wanna destroy this movie until it doesn't exist story follows Nearly 50 years after Leatherface's killing spree in 1973, in the very first Texas Chainsaw Massacre young entrepreneurs Melody (Sarah Yarkin) and Dante (Jacob Latimore) Melody's sister Lila (Elsie Fisher) and Dante's girlfriend Ruth (Nell Hudson) travel to the abandoned Texas town of Harlow, to auction off old properties to create a trendy, heavily gentrified area. While inspecting a dilapidated orphanage. Group found this house it belongs to this old lady
Ginny When she claims she has papers to prove she still owns the property then in script you have this political thing like making white people are racist she calls Dante N word so making Red necks like a racist I understand she is a racist but this movie is becoming like a pollical like white people are racist this and that in movie. An argument breaks out, briefly interrupted by a silent and towering man from upstairs. Ginny then collapses from a heart attack and is rushed to hospital in a police van with Ruth as passenger witch wasn't good idea for her to go. Afterwhile they were driving, Ginny passes away dies Leatherface gets angry kills cop, van crashed then for some stupid reason her rips off Ginny face off wears it then he goes off for killing spree. You have characters doing stupid decisions and stupid choices like Ruth is front passenger seat next to Dead cop you could taken his gun, taser or something to product you and she takes all time to think what is her next move this and that when do I get out off van while Leatherface ripping out Ginny face off, she speaks in radio calling for help, in scene you have Sally Hardesty (Olwen Fouéré) she is actress that replaced Marilyn Burns that actress sadly passed away in 2014. Sally heard Ruth calling out for help that on radio
when she did that she was seeing where Leatherface samething she turns around she is behind her drags Ruth, kills her I am like??? If you taken gun or something if you gotten out of van and run like hell in cornfield but no because writers make her like idiot. Leatherface is back for killing spree Sally heard Ruth calling for help, then that's when Sally goes out for revenge. And theirs nothing to her character at all she is not much in it to say like when you watch Halloween (2018) Jamie lee Curtis character was used better and not wasted or overused doing stupid choices at least she was used better in Halloween (2018) not wasted. In Texas Chainsaw Massacre series (1973) if your fan of first movie you will be raged of what happened to her character and how stupid directors or writers made her she wasn't part of movie she was just over used and she did nothing in movie nothing at all, theirs no backstory about her theirs no update to her character she just works in farm killing pigs, sluaghting pigs that's it no telling backstory of what happened in 1973 or showing her what is update with her character she is important character in film franchise. Like director or writer didn't even update her character... just have one survivor character have her not part of movie over used for nothing.And you have a scene where she goes in room where Leatherface really is she points shotgun she wants him to remember what he really did to her friends and want him to remember her name?? I am like does Leatherface give a crap about what happened 50 years ago??? Just shoot Leatherface he leaves room and she did nothing but crapped her pants. Just director and writers made her look like an idiot making her doing stupid choices, stupid silly choices just makes me wanna laugh even more. Then Sally got killed off got lifted up by Leatherface while Chainsaw is stuck in her stomach throws her where garbage bags are like where this movie belongs to and she doesn't die just yet after chainsaw goes right threw stomach, she encourages Lila to pick up shotgun and shoot Leatherface to average her??? Film will kill your braincells of how pointless this movie really is this film didn't needed Sally at all she was just overused and did nothing in this movie made her like idiot her trying to kill Leatherface failed so it toke him for 50 years to kill someone that she got away with in first movie she is a survivor and now she is Dead of her stupidly I highly doubt it Leatherface pats himself in back of how happy he kills last survivor because he got really upset when she got happy and now 50 years he extremely happy theirs no survivors from past. And script was just how it was written and how it's made is just silly and stupid written and felt rushed movie felt too rushed and overused like they written sally in silly stupid way making her character like a clumsy old lady doesn't know how to shoot, other characters make stupid decisions I thought Dante was unlikeable prick he is of his character so why should I have respect for his character. Script was soo stupidly written like scene where group of people in Bus pulling out their phones recording it as live stream and saying don't do anything or else you will be canceled???? When I heard that, that line in movie doesn't make jack sense in script what so ever is someone in this movie is part of cancel culture witch made me to hate movie even more, stupidest thing for group of people not thinking to escape they were banging on windows, until last survivor in bus, opens window gets cut on half by Leatherface. I am like early ago why didn't rest of people opened window and escaped?? Rather then banging on window when theirs NO help Sally toke like minutes later after Bus Massacre. Most stupidest line in movie you will be canceled so what??? That's gonna stop Leatherface??? That line in movie was lazy, poorly written before all Massacre happened why didn't Melody warn everyone theirs a killer?? Why didn't she help people to help open windows for them to escape??? But no nothing just kept your month shut until idiot says you will be canceled??? I liked that scene in Bus killing Cancel Culture people witch is a funny scene made me laugh so hard, love that scene because no one likes Cancel Culture I do understand. This movie is like lazy, lazy writing, lazy poster, lazy script, stupidest silly lines and dialogs like cancel line witch made me so pissed off killing off and overused original survivor character, then thrown her into garbage bags are that's your final original characters. This movie felt rushed, too overused, unlikeable character like Dante I hated him so BAD, this movie is political like White person is against black person rather then just sticking to character and story??, making characters looking like an idiots, making stupid choices, movie wanted to make a Nostalgic type but it wasn't enough Nostalgic, Halloween (2018) was much more Nostalgic then to this movie. And showdown of this movie is just short, overused, rushed, theirs no effort in this movie at all David Blue Garcia director of this movie made 1 movie in this career this is his 2nd movie it's soo bad poorly written because of this movie horrible director that's how you can tell he made this movie like trash stinks like crap. That's why you don't hire a director who made only 1 movie in his career that tells he shouldn'tnever write movie not even in million years. Got not the heart nor the soul of Tobe Hooper's original movie. One of those modern movies adaptions that will fall quickly just like how this movie quickly failed. Film, wasted tons of pure potential. Delivers nothing but an awful result, being useless and nonsense for all the duration. The 1974 movie left a sense of pure fear and gruesome. Insulting to the viewers intelligence to Die Hard fans, I am not fan of Texas Chainsaw Massacre I liked 1st and 2nd, remake was best in my opinion people if you want see something new just go remake (2003) Texas Chainsaw Massacre starting Jessica Biel at least she is hot looking girl, a very strong lead, good looking lead, at least she makes better choices and how she defends Leatherface much better inthis movie then to Melody or her Lila even Jessica Biel character can kick the crap of those sisters anytime of day, anywhere tie their hands on their back up feet at least Jessica Biel looks like a girl, looks like a Brave Badass and how she Defeated Leatherface was 100 times Better and how she acted was better at least remake had imagination and did a lot different with this Ninth Chainsaw Massacre film looked cheap, actors looked boring and bland nothing to their characters lead girl is like wanna be look like Ripley from Aliens butch type she just looked BORING like empty box that's her performance, script was rushed, god awful, movie rushed, killed off final survivor Sally her character was too overused, at last thing is, this movie has ZERO imagination. If you want Imagination and creative go and watch 1974 Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Sequel with Dennis Hopper or Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) remake and pretend this movie didn't happen.",2022-02-26
"I enjoyed Sarah Yarkin in this movie as ""Melody"" She did pretty decent. For the other cast members it's a no for me. The movie itself cuts to the chase TO quickly. As of for all the other films, at least they made tension building up to entering the home of leatherface. This Franchise has completely lost hope since 2006's version with Jordana Brewster. Sad Days.",2022-02-19
"When I finished the movie, I hated it. Would have awarded 2 stars right then and there but a strange thing happened; after 24 hours I'm still thinking about it. (Something that did not happen with the forgettable new Halloweens, Scream, or Candyman) Then it hit me: this is a satire of the ""legacy sequel."" All the tropes are there: the diverse cast, the clumsy and pointless addition of characters from the original, and all the virtue signaling. (seriously, the plot kicks into gear over offense at a tattered confederate flag) Then those tropes are destroyed, one after another. These characters are such awful people that you immediately start rooting for their demise. In any other movie the strong African American character would have been the hero but here he's the most unlikable character in the film, while the white, gun toting redneck is the most complex and compassionate character. Speaking of guns, after setting you up for an anti-gun message, the film pulls the rug out by actually taking a pro gun stance when the PTSD suffering character finds her strength by picking up an AR-15 and fighting back. And that legacy character set up to be the next Laurie Strode? She shows up only to get butchered within minutes. I found this to be a betrayal of the Sally character, but realistically, what else was going to happen? Did anyone really think she was going to defeat a 250 pound man in hand to hand combat? The film is not without its flaws, in fact, there are many. But the dismantling of the ""legacy sequel"" was actually quite genius. Scream raised a giant middle finger to fans of original films by calling them toxic if they don't like the new movies, TCM raises a giant middle finger to Scream, and the rest of those garbage sequels with the massacre of the moronic cliches that those films created. And my God, that final scene when Eyebrows gets yanked out of the self driving Tesla and decapitated was an inspired moment.",2022-02-20

Acting isn't the worst I've seen and a few of them aren't that bad. Most of the chase scenes/kill scenes are pretty terrifying and gruesome...well...until the hilariously terrible bus massacre scene ruined the whole film. The climax up to the ending are absolutely dreadful. The characters are extremely irritatingly stupid especially Sally, whose appearance had potential but the writers wasted it.The movie is still actually watchable in some moments, particularly the first half of the film or so, but mostly it's just bad. I cannot recommend it, unless you're a fan of slashers and of the series.",2023-05-27

"I mean seriously? Was ""do your thing cuz"" not enough? This is clearly an example of someone old that help write the script, trying to portray what it's like being a teen in modern day, and like usual, it failed. Obviously Exaggerated and unrealistic. Was it supposed to be funny? I'd hope not..I feel like another thing that threw me off in
particular about this movie is how they
had a lot of characters dressed. They
tried mixing old themed clothing
(assuming trying to have inspiration from the original era of the movies, the 70's) into modern day with
touch screen phones and just typical
modern day stuff we have, and it just
doesn't fit for me. I'm assuming their idea
was to have the surrounding theme deal
with a bit nostalgia, to try and give the
audience a better connection to the
movie, trying to make it feel more classic
or original to past tense Texas in a way if
that makes sense, and I just don't think it
worked.Oh and let's not forget how they OF COURSE had to make an edgy teen for the sister, saying stupid edgy things almost anytime she talked. Again, another HEAVILY exaggerated and cringe moment of someone older writing the script thinking they know how teens talk and act in this generation.There's so many deaths in the movie as well that happened from pure stupidity, yet we're supposed to feel bad for them? So many cliché moments with them too. Like who honestly saw them open the cars sky roof and not sense in the slightest bit one of their deaths coming? And of course the ending consisted of the typical ""you thought you killed the killer in a horror movie but didn't"" idea. SO ORIGINAL. Not to mention they saw what leatherface was capable of, yet, just because they ASSUMED he died (typical cliché in horror movies) it's a great idea to slowly and CALMLY drive off from there? After seeing how many people died in front of them?And we're not even gonna talk about their little idea of having an OG survivor from the original movie try and have a hero moment and kill leatherface herself? Clearly a rip off of the recent Halloween movies, having both killer and survivor be old at this point, years later (you can guess where this is going) and her trying to take him down herself. Again, SO ORIGINAL.All in all, they didn't try with this movie. Like. At all. What they DID do was try and make everything feel original, went in fact it was totally the opposite. And they made literally almost every character hard to have a connection to, or feel bad for any deaths. Usually in horror movies I'm hoping the victims escape or live, but in this movie if everyone died I seriously wouldn't have complained and it would've made the movie better. So for anyone reading my review, please save yourself some time. I promise watching paint dry is more entertaining. I don't think I've ever watched a movie so quickly (first day it came out) after release and regretted it. Another horror movie fail! Now I see why certain franchises don't even attempt to try a new movie in this day and age.",2022-02-21

I can only assume they're making more because of the end teaser of Leatherface going back to his proper home. So if that's true I hope they give us better actors, ones that you want to see survive. I always admired Jessica Biel's character from the 2003 film, she was a strong final girl.Instead of bringing something to the franchise, this movie took from it. They played the trick of bringing back an original character but it was pointless. The town setting ruined it too. It did not feel like a Texas Chainsaw movie at all.

"Well... Where do i start? I decided to give this film a chance since, knowing the original, nowadays with better production capabilities the film could add something to the original. I couldn't be more wrong... The characters are terribly flat, there is no evolution and we can't get attached to any of them throughout the story... The actors don't help either, Lila (Elsie Fisher) is most likely the worst horror movie actress I've ever seen, she shows no emotion whatsoever, in the final scene where her sister dies, we don't feel the character's pain or shock, it seemed like a stranger had died for her. Melody ( Sarah Yarkin) started off annoying and I ended up finding her to be a pretty reasonable actress as well, nothing special. But if the worst were the characters and the actors, I wouldn't give the movie such a bad rating. The story and the script make no sense at all, besides the stupidity and dumbness of the characters... So you learn that a murderer is on the loose and who do they decide to call?? A stupid old woman who can't even hold a gun. No wonder she died 5 minutes after the confrontation with Leatherface. Oh and by the way, an old lady can support a chainsaw through the stomach and the chest?! Only in this movie... And don't forget that she had the opportunity to kill him with a close range shot, but what did she do? Started a conversation about the past...
Leatherface can break a policeman's arm with one hand and break a man's knee with a kick, but against two teenage girls can he not have more strength and win the fights easily? In the bus scene, didn't anyone think to try to get past Leatherface and escape through the door or crawl through it? It was easier to waste 10 minutes with random character deaths. Couldn't the girl who was in the police car at the time of the accident just play dead so as not to risk leatherface killing her? In the scene where the old woman traps the girls in the back of the car, instead of screaming, couldn't they find a way to break the glass and escape or move to the front and drive away?And finally, when the girls are supposed to kill Leatherface, a top-of-the-line car appears in the middle of the road out of nowhere, just in time for them to escape... At the end of the movie, I just wanted it to end... it was painful to watch the final minutes. I don't remember ever seeing a movie so stupid and so dumb.I only don't give it a 1 because the movie is quite violent, something that seems to be hard to accomplish in movies nowadays, especially in horror ones.

"""Legendary sold the film to Netflix after a string of disastrous test screenings""
That's what IMDB says in the Trivia section, and it all makes sense after watching the film.No amount of gore will save a film from a bad script. The audience are not that naive. Characters doesn't have to be perfect, but at least their actions and motives have to make sense. You can't expect us to believe a scenario where a woman doesn't kill the villain when she has the chance to. Or when the characters make extremely illogical decisions just to be ""there"".The film weirdly tries to inject some depth into the main character by having her have a ""traumatic"" past, but it comes off as forced because the character doesn't have enough screen time to show her struggles. It's all half-baked.This film was extremely irritating to watch.",2022-02-19
Athmosphere during the first half of the movie was nostalgic and exciting. I also did not find film as much woke as I thought it would be so points for that.The rest of it was pretty much rubbish if you ask me. Leatherface was shot multiple times during the film but that did not bother him at all. And neither did his 70 + years of age. Many victims were shot or had their lungs pierced etc but they were able to walk or help other charecters after this. This was the most annoying aspect for me. The bus slashing scene was pretty stupid and more comedy than horror.So strong 3/10 it is. Not good enough for 4/10. 2003 remake will always be my favourite.,2022-02-19
"In a genre populated with cocky know-it-alls you can't wait to see get offed, this cast puts in an impressive effort.Between convincing us they are terrified (helping put us in those same shoes) and the presence of the first and, let's face it, still the most terrifying masked human monster in cinema history... if you didn't jump out of your seat or consider watching through your fingers at any stage....
well I just don't believe you.A sufficient amount of blood and guts, with minor release valves of humour help make this a ride that although you may have been on many times before, still manages to thrill.",2022-02-21
Keeps you interested the whole time. Dumb characters. Poor acting. Low budget film. Would not recommend. Half of these people would have been dead right away but because it's a movie they have 9 lives like a cat. And leather face can't die. Wtf.,2022-03-02
Give people with negative reviews a tissue cause the movie was great!!! Stop living in the past cause I'm glad their was a new Texas Chainsaw movie!! Lots of gore and some laughs.,2022-02-18
"When I saw that they were making, as scream 2022 put it, a ""requel"" for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I was wondering how bad they'd mess up if I'm being honest. But because me and my friend have seen the other ones together I figured we should see this one too.Let's start with the gore. When the first half hour didn't have anything happen, I honestly wasn't shocked because that's how they all start. A little bit later though leatherface rips a guys hand off, chops a guy in the face with a cleaver, bashes another guys face in with a sledgehammer after he was dead and chops people in half and take their heads off.Now for the supporting characters. Everyone is obviously like most of this generation- obsessed with social media, which promotes some people saying cringy crap, but it leads to some of the goriest scenes, so they are forgiven.And now for the final girl. Every franchise has at least one. Friday the 13th, Halloween, Scream, and this one is no different. The final girl is the supposedly main-character's sister, which was fairly shocking. When they start to leave the town in an extremely slow-moving self-driving car, one of the two main characters dies after leatherface is presumed dead and he chops her head off, which was suprising. All in all the final girl was underused.Nostalgia was a major factor in this movie. They even go back to the house from the original. They also use scenes from the original and have the first final girl, who tries to get vengeance as you've probably seen in the trailer .All in all its a great film that had a slow start, so it's a 8/10.",2022-02-19
Characters are terrible and dumb beyond belief.The plot is terrible.It's loaded with politics but doesn't seem to have any idea what kind of point it's trying to make.The blood and gore were fun I guess but even then I have not idea why anyone would give this movie more than 2 stars.,2022-02-20
"Yeah, I know it has a lot of flaws (story, characters, acting), but my expectations were so low I ended up having fun. Visually the film is cool, the cinematography and scenery is solid, and most of all it has A LOT of bloody violence. That's what I wanted, that's what I got.",2022-02-18
"Such a shame. There is so much scope for a great sequel to the original classic, I'm amazing that there still hasn't been one. Guess we'll have to wait, fingers crossed, for the next attempt. 😕",2022-04-13

"I'm really surprised by the negative responses here. This is a movie made for fans. It's outrageous. And yes the characters are dumb, but hey make BAD decisions, but this isn't Citizen Kane. This is the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and you get ALOT of all three. I screamed and jumped out of my seat multiple times. Was way better than I thought. A-",2022-02-19
"Boring, meaningless, and why? I've never seen the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre so I have no background to really feed off of other than the Texas Chainsaw Massacre film that starred Jesssica Biel. I liked that film when I was younger but it did not old up when I rewatched it as an adult. I will say at least this film was slightly better but not by much.The acting here is passable? I guess. I'm not familiar with any of these actors so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say they were just given trash material. Boring writing, and boring story. This films only saving grace is it's run time as it is a very short film.What kept me entertained though was the creative kills and a great abundance of blood. The massacre of the bus was really something else and was genuinely disturbing. Also the portrayal of these kids when Leatherface attacked them on the bus had me laughing because it was sadly accurate of the social media generation.The films ending is what costed it to go from a 5 out of 10 to a 4 it was just stupid, cliche, and unnecessary just more likely than not to set up a sequel.But even with the fun creative kills and the amount of gore this film is just poor. I probably should give this film a 3 but those kills were honestly something to watch, also these kids weren't cliche characters like in most slasher films so I'm willing to be generous with my score.IMDb: 4/10

"Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2022 is far better than the 4.8 rating and I can't for the life of me understand that rating. This is the best Texas Chainsaw movie since the original, this truly was a massacre with body parts flying all over the place. I was on the edge of my seat pumped all the way through. Don't listen to the users on here rating it so low cause they were watching a different movie, I loved this one and wasn't disappointed at all for 1 minute.",2022-05-01
Killing her sister to show the auto drive of the fancy car . There was no story at all . So boring. The thing that does not make sense for me is that he did not die after stabbing and shooting many times .,2022-02-22
"The acting and story is great specialy with the 2 sisters and the Sally caracter with her flack back souvenir picture of her friends in the mini van from the 1974 original classic , it make the fans of the original nostalgic. Well made action suspence and gore, the ending was simply perfect till they ruin it all with a stupid shocking scene in the last minute , without it is a great horror movie .",2022-02-19
"Okay, yes the writing wasn't good at first but it did get better. There was a moment or two where simple physics and body health don't match lol but overall I thought it was so fun and great! Very suspenseful and loved the ending. For some reason Leatherface will always be one of the scarier figures for me with the chainsaw, and this installment I thought lived up to that pretty well.",2022-02-26
"As it started I noted the cinematography and setting was very good, the atmosphere was perfect form the beginning.What bothered me a bit was the main characters, I didn't really like anyone from the ones you're supposed to root for, but then at least I appreciate the attitude of breaking with the pathetic cliché of the superhot idiotic models bunch. Plus, added to the main group of characters, there're a few extra characters that break the teenager against monster boredom.This Leatherface is probably one of the best versions I've seen, it's almost clever at some points, and visually imponent.The amount of gore and kills is also the highest in a Leatherface movie, by far, and there are quite some good gory practical effects that old timers will appreciate.Good performances overall, excellent cinematography, decent story, and an attitude of doing something slightly different for such an overdone franchise adds up to a solid movie for me.",2022-02-20
Overall it's gory and has some good throwbacks. Stupid people.make dumb mistakes. Honestly how many times do you have to kill someone for them to be dead. Kill them! Never ever think if you shot them they are dead. Chop off a head or just simply run. Also he is really fast. It's the fastest running bug dude I have ever seen. He is also carrying a chain saw and is fast. Also bus scene is great! This has to be one of the coolest I have seen in awhile. Entertaining and worth the watch. Could have some better actors in some parts but the main characters don't disappoint. Stay tuned after the credits for an additional scene. Overall I would say to watch it and pay attention to the little details. The flash of face and how he comes back as leather face. There are details in the movie that makes the film an overall good horror Gory film. Nothing like the last one which is a good thing.,2022-02-19
"I understand Leatherface its a big human with thick skin, very durable,dressed in skins but...after 5-6 shootings aka shotgun Winchester Model 1887 maybe, this shotgun used by Arnold in Terminator 2...ok, after 5-6 shootings and a chainsaw in throat, Leatherface appears at the end alive and unharmed...Well, this is a derision for us , a bad joke and this action destroying the film.",2022-02-24
"A few flashbacks from the original, a chainsaw and a familiar house, is the ony acceptable reason, but far from enough, for this movie to title it self «Texas Chainsaw Massacre». A sad and disgraceful way to treat a classic. The 1974 original was banned, this one should be banned for entirely different reasons.",2022-02-19
"This movie is a blatant, pale imitation of Halloween (2018), and it doesn't do It that well.It is what it is. Somebody said, ""hey, Halloween made lots of money doing this, so can we. How hard can it be?""The result is a half baked plot that pits a poor man's Laurie Strode against her chainsaw-wielding maniac for who managed to elude capture for half a century despite being exactly where someone with half a brain might go to find him.It's not the worst thing I've ever seen, but wow, it's really not what it struggles to be. The obvious effort put forth is embarrassing by the time it's all over.",2022-02-19
"Overall the film was fun to watch, especially for those who are fans of the franchise, but I couldn't help but feel annoyed by (all) the main characters.",2022-02-19
"I wen't into this movie expecting a gory slasher movie, a terrible story, and a fun watch. After finishing this movie I would like the hour and 30 minutes of my life back. They tried to add school shootings, anti gun violence, and racism all in a slasher film. At the beginning of the movie I thought alright this movie looks terrible so far but funny. I liked the idea of a ghost town and thought there was potential. Well then half way through it was practically unwatchable. They tried to emulate what the halloween franchise has done and bring back an iconic character that survived the past movie. Little did they know the character they brought back was not anywhere near as iconic as Laurie Stroud. I haven't even mentioned the worst part of the movie yet. When the two main characters (the sisters) start to drive away in their self driving car the older sister gets pulled out of the window by leatherface who then slices her head off. What is the other sister doing during this? Well she's watching it all happen standing in a sun roof while the car is driving away at maybe 10 miles an hour self driving. One of the worst movies I have ever seen I will just leave it as that.",2022-02-19
"At first, I was going to write, ""Oh great...social media ""InFlUeNcErS"", but then I wanted to title it, ""I was rooting for Leatherface the whole time"".The setup is so stupid. The influencers have zero respect for anyone that isn't them. The return of an original character from the first movie (although recasted due to her real life death) bulids up then is completely wasted. The bus scene where everyone pulls out their phones and threatens Leatherface will get ""cancelled"" is ridiculous. Keep all this modern day trash out of movies. We watch movies to be entertained and escape reality, not to be reminded of it. The final scene tries to emulate Terminator 2 but it's SO bad.Some of the death scenes were good. Other than that the whole film is a a piece of crap.",2022-10-12
"I didn't expected something better than a very bad movie, the good part was that it's very short. The fact that the action is set in the modern world and things like phones, and internet are used but not in the purpose of saving lifes is a very dumb concept, like everyone in the movie is actually a monkey or something. You better make a remake of a remake, still set in the 70s than something without sense.From my point of view the 2013 part was a better sequel for the original than this part.",2022-03-26
"Well, Texas Chainsaw Massacre serves its purposes as far as a slasher goes. Clocking around just 83 minutes, it's a very economical film. Entertaining with some decent kills. However, was it particularly scary or had enough creepy ambient to make the audiences anxious or squirmed on their seat? I don't think so. It fell flat on that department.",2022-02-18
"I don't care what the title says, the only thing that somewhat relates to the originals is the fact he's using a chainsaw.. and he doesn't even do that for most of the movie. This has a COMPLETELY different feel to it & im not here for it AT ALL.",2022-02-18
A liberal slant to ruin a classic. Starts off with mocking the hillbillies and claiming racism. The high and mighty liberals mess everything up and then they get what they deserve. The only good part of the movie is that they die LOL.,2022-02-27
Almost turned this off after the first 10 minutes and again 30 min in because of the ridiculous woke agenda they desperately needed for this movie.....in the end I guess it worked because the only reason we finished the movie was to see the main characters meet their inevitable end.,2022-02-20
"Not a complete waste of time, but close. The script and plot were as great and as accurate a depiction of rural Texas as you would expect from two guys from Ecuador. Final fight is just plain awful. The biggest plot hole for me was a retired Texas Ranger wearing a straw hat in the rain. 1.5 stars.",2022-03-03
Best comedy I've seen in a long time. The story follows Leather face the main protagonist just trying to deal with die hard anti gun blm activists moving into his town. He's the hero the town deserves and tries his best to keep them safe from the impending wokeness of left win America attempting to corrupt his town. I was cheering the whole movie and left in stiches laughing as the main group of gen z's struggle to cope being outside of their safe space.,2022-02-19
"Overall this is a good movie for horror fans. Some of the plot elements are badly implemented and the Halloween-inspired character piece falls flat - but the kills are good and the final girls are decent. The production values and acting are definitely above your average straight to video efforts. Better than I was expecting, that's for sure.",2022-02-20
"TCM is a series that needed to be left at the original. The original was an interesting, well-shot and scary film. Everything that came after has been a useless, boring or down-right bad money grab. I expected to see them take another shot at this as the other classics seem to be getting more and more remakes. Unfortunately, this is no different than the previous sequel attempts. It's downright bad. Horror can be a great vehicle to explore social issues and this movie is a clown-car. It terribly attempts to address about 20 different issues and handles all of them poorly. Don't waste your time.",2022-03-03

I would of left 0 stars if it was an option.",2022-02-20
"I'm not disappointed with this latest part, but compared to the previous parts, it's pretty bad. I don't even have to say that the plot is repeated in almost every series of these films, it is literally identical.With the advancement of cinematography, we got the improvement of the graphic scenes in this film, but not the acting. Some parts are completely banal, such as the fact that so far this main character of ours 'leatherface' should have been buried or physically incapable of dealing with such things.Let's not forget the masked scenes that seem brutal to us, but not at all realistic. At least I don't remember this movie for so many unreal scenes.I foresaw literally every part of the film, which was not difficult, but it happens with other series of films on the market. Most likely, in the absence of the author's idea, even through the series, that charm is lost.It's not worthy!* I forgot to add, if there are already plans to continue this series, it would be good to bring back some of the previous actors who survived ;;",2022-02-18

Lol bus load of woke gentrified people with cellphones telling a serial killer if you do anything you're canceled while all their phones are out? Worst moving in the history of low budget rip offs.,2022-08-03
"As every horror fan knows all around very well, you can't hold a decent villain with leather mask down. This new sequel of Toby Hooper's 1974 horror classic film 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' follows the path of 'Halloween' film. The direction was all good but there are some parts have brutal moments. This long-running horror film series is classic yet bloody, seriously, there's so much blood splattered on the screen that you'll have an urge to wear a poncho if you sit too close.The camera movements have more static which they gave me the vibe from the beginning up to the end of the frame. This reboot is better than the last one ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"", but there's so much blood squirting from one place to another, and surely your body would shake because of how the killing choreography became more brutal.They may, however, be disappointed by the fact that Leatherface meets a gruesome fate at the film's end. The slasher was NOT FULLY DEAD, which makes the story worse. I am very sure that there would be a new sequel for this AND another blood-splattering ideas and killing actions from Leatherface.",2022-02-18
The film has its moments thrills and gore . The bus scene was a bit over the top . Leather face is a great villain and it was good to see that they brought back the sole survivor from the original film .Some of the characters make stupid decisions in the film . The end is a shock .,2022-02-19

The Lady that was a survivor from 50 years ago just let him walk by her while she had the gun pointed at him. Come on (eye roll) not scary LoL Yes it was woke, but it does end with the Gun haters using guns to survive. See. Better to be safe then sorry.",2022-02-19
"I did have low expectations which helped as this movie doesn't blow you away in any way. I'm a sucker for leatherface movies as he creeped the hell out of me as a kid and so naturally, I love him! So of course I go a lot more easy on these films than others. I like that it tries some new things and not be a 1 on 1 copy of the movies we've seen prior. When you watch a TCM film you watch it for the kills and they're tasty;).I think fans will love this film because they love leatherface and you're getting more action from him in this film. The characters are okay, nothing special. Story is........eh?. It exists but has 0 depth. If that's what you're looking for tho, this ain't the kinda movie to deliver on that front.To summarise, awesome kills and badass leatherface. The movie feels familiar but does some new things too which I can appreciate. If you like gory violence watch this, if you don't there's really nothing to find here. This is definitely one of the better reboots and a fun time!",2022-02-19
I'm not sure how this is only a 5.1 or whatever? Is it the original? No. Is it better then the orginal sequel? No. Is the 2003 remake? No. Heck it's not even the prequel to the 2003 remake but it's good enough to where it needs more credit. TCM as a whole is a rough series in fact it's in a dangerous race with the Halloween franchise for most changed timelines but of all the movies TCM has come out with lately this is the best one. Sure it has it flaws and things to not like but I think they overall did a good job and it's worth the watch. The 2013 one gave us the horrible plot whole of not adding up timeline wise and leather face was a joke as well. This one gives TCM fans what they are looking for and what they come to expect. Leather face with a chainsaw and other iconic weapons terrorizing people. Yes it could've been better but with the last two movies we got. It sure could've been a lot worse. I would say it is easily if not tied for the 5th best film of the franchise.,2022-02-20
"I was actually enjoying this film until the last 20 mins when Sally Hardesty arrived into town to confront Leatherface. Up until then I appreciated the new social media age angle and the over the top gore. I can turn a blind up until a point on credibility in horror films but the final act is so preposterous and downright stupid that it completely destroys the film. Honestly, who actually came up with this and thought it was a good idea. What a terrible waste for poor old Sally as the idea was initially a great one (although borrowing heavily from the resurgence of Jamie Lee Curtis in the new Halloween films).",2022-02-19
"Filmed ENTIRELY in Bulgaria and mostly over a 250 foot stretch of street on a cheaply made back lot studio, this movie is absolutely HORRIBLE. How hard is it to escape a single street with 6 buildings? Characters are all unlikable and the story is half baked. If you love gory kills and don't care about anything else, then this movie might be for you.4 out of 10. Garbage.",2022-02-23

"I am very glad that the classic slashers are back. Of course, Jason and Freddy are still in deep dream, but now we have the Chucky series, the new Scream ( very good movie, you can read my review about this movie), Halloween movies ( not bad movies, that still have a classic style) and a Texas Chainsaw massacre( oh ...no...) . Requel of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre looks like a fan film with beautiful and brutal murder's. Yes, this movie has an interesting and bloody murder's and some stylish frames, but in general it is a very crumpled and mixed movie. In fact, this movie is about nothing. It shouldn't have come out so weird. This requel doesn't even come close to the original in style. There is no this madness, constant pressure and heat. The New Texas Chainsaw Massacre is an unfortunate fanfic that has nothing to do with the original. But as a slasher, it turned out to be quite bloody. At least it pleases.",2022-02-18
"In 2006 my husband and I left the movie theatre after watching The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, and didn't say a word for the first half hour after the movie had ended. It was so well executed and got under our skin.Now we've just watched this one and I must say, that even though Netflix rarely disappoints in their movie making skills, this one is horrific.No scares, a bad attempt to tell a story and Leatherface has completely lost his fright. And. Unless he has learned how to throw a mean curveball (or -head) there's no way he threw that head into the bus.So many things in this film was disappointing and we are huge horror and Chainsaw fans. This is more like a parody than a worthy sequel.And seriously. The last girl standing is driving away in an electric car on autopilot while screaming.Points for trying but this is like one of those cakes that looks like it's gonna taste amazing but they forgot to put in the flavour and it's dry. I'm just glad we didn't pay to see it in a theatre.",2022-02-20
"If you replaced the name and switched out the main character for a different slasher baddie nothing would change. It's barely a TCM movie either. The characters are ok, nothing extraordinary. The ending is so mind numbingly dumb. Don't waste your time.",2022-02-23
"The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the best horror movies ever made... this is not...As a fan of the original I feel insulted. I can't give this a proper review without spoilers, so here goes.To be fair, it was entertaining enough for me to watch it once, but I will never come back to this dumpster fire.There is one scene I really enjoyed where a bus full of annoying woke hipsters pull out their phones and threaten to record video of Leatherface and cancel him. This is objectively hilarious to think that a mass murderer would be threatened by the idea of getting cancelled. He then obviously massacres everyone on the bus. It is by far the most entertaining scene in the movie.Now for the problems I have with it. First of all, there is this gorgeous blonde girl and I assumed she was the lead character, nope, she gets killed quite quickly. The lead character turns out to be this annoying weird girl with curly hair. Big mistake. The best looking female has to be the main character in a horror movie, her annoying ugly friend is the one who is supposed to kick the bucket first, It might seem like a shallow rule, but, I stand by it. If you look at all of the best horror movies, the leading lady is always a stone cold fox. I think this even goes beyond just men (and women) liking to look at pretty women, I think it is also because, the best horror villains tend to be big psycho males, so there is a rape undertone to it as well as a killing thing. I know it's f'd up, but horror movies are f'd up, because human beings are f'd up, it is what it is. It makes sense that the male killer would choose the most beautiful female as his prize victim, she is his gold medal. In this movie they kill the gold medal first, and have bronze be the heroine, that is just silly. So I am not impressed that they killed the hot blonde first.They killed her annoying black boyfriend after that, which I have no problem with, except one thing which I will address later. Then its this hunky redneck dude. He likes guns and hates smug city folk who try to tell him what to do. This guy was kind of a bad ass, a good enough character. He really reminded me of myself.Then there is this timid nerdy girl who is curly's sister. Nerdy girl was in a school shooting, that's her backstory. Fair enough.Now here is my biggest problem with the movie, they tried to tie it back to the original by bringing in the original leather face and the main woman from the original movie. This was completely unnecessary and it is done quite badly. There are just so many problems with it. First thing is first, it has been more than 50 years! So they are both ancient. Old people have no place in this kind of horror movie. Horror movies like this are full of action, and old people are weak and slow, it is just ridiculous seeing people who are at least 70 years old try to run around and kill each other. Another thing I did not like was that the main woman actively goes looking for leather face... how stupid can a human being really be?... this is a big strong murderer who almost killed you, you narrowly escape with your life and 50 years later decide to go back and find him to get revenge. That is just so dumb. If she was hell bent on revenge, then hire a big team of mercenaries with machine guns and get them to go in and kill him while you watch from a safe distance, and also maybe don't wait until your 80 years old! And she doesn't even manage to kill him, what a dummy.But this is actually my biggest problem with the movie, this is supposed to be the original leather face, that makes him at least 70 probably closer to 80 years old, but he is still effortlessly killing people in their 20s and 30s, that is just absurd. There was no need to bring back the original characters and try to tie it together with the original movie. All they had to do was make a new version of leather face, if you were really desperate to link things then just make it his son or grandson or something.I know this review is sloppy and not very good, but so is this movie, and I haven't been paid millions of dollars to write this. I'm just doing my good deed for the day and trying to warn like minded horror fans that this film is crap. It is entertaining enough to watch if you are bored and not expecting too much, but it is not even close to being in the same league as the original. It is kind of like comparing Paul McCartney's newest albums to The Beatles, best to stick with the classics and just forget this bad new stuff.",2022-07-12
Do not attempt to make a sequel to THIS movie. It was an absolute complete waste of my time. This is coming from a guy that loves horror movies and has always been a fan of TCM movies.,2022-02-23
"If you can forgive filmmakers for all the sequels and reboots, this is a fun contemporary sequel of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I'm surprised, because I was pleasantly surprised with this version. A lot of people focus on how horrible the reactions are.I'm not gonna spoil anything about the movie, but I will spoil connections between the original and this 2022 version. It's nice to see a survivor coming back to revenge the deaths of her friends. Out of all the remakes and reboots, this is one I've really enjoyed because it ties in the original movie with modern society into 2022. I think that a lot of the negative comments are coming from people who don't like the hate of the confederate flag and people trying to be better humans than we were over the last 2000 years. Modern society wants to be better and it's obviously scaring some reviewers.",2023-02-18
"It's no surprise that after decades of sequels and remakes and sequels to the remakes, the TCM franchise feels a bit reductive and stale. This film, which shares its title with the original, is just another subpar addition to the rest.The story is goofy and completely unrealistic as well as unrelatable. A group of 20-somethings buy a ghost town and then bus in their likeminded friends to help gentrify it- getting murdered by a chainsaw-wielding maniac is more likely than this storyline.The cast is made up of all ethnicities and genders (cool) and the filmmakers made sure to shoehorn as much social commentary (not cool) and of-the-moment tech (Tesla's autopilot, live-streaming your own murder) into the barely-there plot as they could. The main catalyst for the action in the story was the attempt to tear down a tattered old confederate flag, spotted by one of the triggered yuppies. It was hard to tell, at least for me, if the film was poking fun at the more extreme left (characters unable to control their emotions when they see a gun) or if their behavior was an attempt to endear them to the viewer. Admittedly, the rednecks and the yuppies were treated with a similar amount of respect when it comes to their depiction.Also, the timeline makes no sense.The acting was decent, the jump scares were plentiful, and the effects and gore were masterfully done.",2022-02-20
Hard to watch. Not too picky about who they cast. Some are hard to look at. Then add usual gore.......boring. Not your usual pretty girls as characters. Really odd to watch.,2022-02-26
"The only gripe I had was the last 10 seconds of the movie... super cliche and annoying. Good kills though, especially the genocide. Shot well, lots of blood, looked like they used film which always looks better on movies. Sarah Yarkin was definitely the best character.",2022-02-19
It's ain't no Shakespeare but it had some good kills for big slasher fans. Yeah it didn't make alot of sense but is that really what we're here for 🤷‍♂️,2022-02-25
This film isn't really as bad as people are trying to make seem. Could the script have used another revision or two? Yeah. But it still very well directed with great kills and decent acting.,2022-02-26
"No one from this film will be parading at the Oscars buy that's hardly the point.Not too long, Itchy and Scratchy cartoon like violence, Monty Python /Kill Bill gore.Forget the plot holes especially the bits where fatal wounds seem to incapacitate people much as a gnat bite does,get in a few beers, a couple of mates, enjoy a ridiculous film that just doesn't take itself too seriously and run a book on the next victim.",2022-03-13
"I went in this movie with low expectations, and throughout the movie I was surprisingly entertained. I knew it wasn't going to be a masterpiece, but it's enjoyable. Story is a bit meh, but the kills are gory! Don't expect too much, and don't compare it with the others. Just shut off your brain for 80 some mins. It's definitely better than the Texas Chainsaw 2013 for sure.",2022-02-19
"The worst casting, plot line, and movie in general possibly ever. The writer should never be allowed to produce another film. Atleast they made it only 1 hour and 23 minutes so that I didn't waste anymore of my time.",2022-02-27
"I'm not sure if we were supposed to be rooting for the Austin-ite hipsters, but they were all quite insufferable. However, the director is from Austin, so I'm guessing he wants us to feel for them. You genuinely don't care about any of the main characters, so there's a big problem right there. I give it three stars purely on the basis that the kills were mostly pretty good, especially the bus scene, and the cinematography is also not bad.",2022-02-26
"I wish there was some nudity... also main actresses could have been hotter, like Jessica Biel was. After all, it is a no brain horror movie.Otherwise a solid atmospheric horror for one-time watch.",2022-02-22
"....full of stupid people acting stupidly. Riddled with every conceivable cliche imaginable. Simply terrible. Still, the gore's kinda cool if you don't mind wading through trash to watch it.",2022-02-18
"The most pathetic Texas Chainsaw ever. What this movie highlights is how pathetic the ""influencer"" generation is.The girl with the curly hair, Mel?, is extremely annoying. They knew what properties were available before they got there and now all of a sudden, she had to have proof and felt so bad about this woman she didn't know.Add the wonderful way to exploit a school shooting victim as her sister and make the sister seem so weak and child like, unlike her ""successful"" big sister whose biggest challenge was what?!I understand why they couldn't find anyone to show this movie. If Hollywood said, ""No more movies until we get original movies."" Hollywood would be shut down right now and there would be a million period pieces.Haven't even finished watching the movie and it's just noise in the background at this point.",2022-02-27
"You will not like this. I almost turned it off when I realized how ""woke"" it was going to be but then the killing started. I gave four stars (instead of 1) because the acting was good for what they had to work with. I'm very good at suspending reality when it comes to movies but seriously....leather face would have to be at least 75 years old. And the decisions these people made.... I can't make believe that anyone is that stupid. I think that if it had been a whole new type of killer and not linked to original it would have fared better.",2022-02-18
"The new Netflix Texas Chainsaw Massacre film was Awesome! Idk what ppl are expecting with a slasher film. Clearly 90% of you forgot what they are thx to Insidious and trash. TCM has always been about senseless killing and not Oscar winning story and acting. The film was better than Halloween Kills even while mimicking it. The cinematography was excellent and so was the soundtrack! The story was alright. The acting I'll agree was the worst, but Leatherface and the kills were the best we will probably see in 2022! Watch it for what it's and that's a fun romp into mayhem.",2022-02-20
"So many boxes checked it takes you out of the story right off the bat. Interracial couple, check. Black guy with a hot blonde? Check. Austin? Check. Gun phallic observation? Check. Add a truck that belches filth, bonus check. School shooting survivor? Check. Gun nut is proud Texan. Check. Confederate flag? Check. The only thing missing was a trans character.So much committee thinking, oh yeah, there's a madman with a chainsaw and a mommy fixation, plus an original survivor shows up to save the day to give a link to the original.Somewhere in there is a completely unrealistic murder spree with no suspense or horror whatsoever. The killings played second fiddle to the obvious construction of the entire first half.",2022-12-09
Trying to figure out if this was a joke or not? Did they actually pay someone to make this festering trash heap? 1 & 2 are some of my favorite movies to this day..I dont know wth this is? It's like the PC woke police tried their hand at horror..and comedy..but I don't think it was meant to be comedic...you need to watch it just to see how bad it is..,2022-02-21
"Never have I said ""is it almost finished"" for a movie, this movie was terrible!!! As a fan of the franchise this movie sucked.As with everything now days it pushes the typical leftist agenda!!! Oh the scene where Sally is in the bloody air with a chainsaw right through her guts but yet survives to try and be the hero just made me feel embarrassed for the writers.Don't waste your time on this!From the ending after the credits I really hope they aren't considering a sequel to this!",2022-02-19
"Set 47 years after the original TCM, I found it to be down the middle for me: not bad, not great either. Who knew that a 74-year-old man is spry enough to kill a bunch of Millennials and Zoomers? Just goes to show you that age doesn't slow down evil.",2022-02-23
"The first thing i noticed about this film was the feel and tone .. You get a different vibe without the ""family"" around . I didn't care for the story at all , but watching leatherface brutal killings of the woke mob was a lot of fun .. The actor playing him this time around did a great job . All in all sit back relax and enjoy a fun ride . Just forget the lame story.",2022-02-21
"This was absolutely awful. The acting, the script, the directing, and worst of all, Leatherface. I don't know what this was. That fact that Fede Alvarez had any involvement in this movie I will never understand. Major disappointment and so far is the worst movie of the year.",2022-02-19
"The movie starts off as one of those gentrified, rich teen slashers instead of keeping the original TCM classic slasher. It gets stupid with the acting, which gets quite irritating. I wouldn't recommend this unless you're in for the gore.",2022-02-21
I will admit that this movie is about as original as a cover band but I had a lot of fun watching it and that's how a movie should make you feel. The writing and story line was decent and the acting is what you would expect. The kills were exceptional. I was a giddy as a school girl during the bus scene. Not just for the way Leatherface killed his victims but for who they were. There were certainly nods to Lori Strode and The original Friday the 13th as was as the Original Texas Chainsaw Massacre but those things simply made me smile in amusement.It's a fun film. Go watch it!,2022-02-19
One of worest movies ever. Waste of time . Not worth to watch. So low quality and full of stupid stuff. Even words can't describe how bad is this movie.,2022-03-17
"Wauw ... Believed I have seen it all, but THIS movie takes the prize, for worst film in years.Bad script, lousy actors. One dies quick by a cut in the stumach, and another is lifted Up, with a Chainsaw throuw her , and lifes in for 5 more minuts, to shoot and throw punshlines 😂And spoileralert.....Leatherface lives on 😳",2022-02-19
"For starters, Texas Chainshaw Massacre is one of my favorite horror franchises and when I heard they were doing a sequel that would be connected to the original, at first I was excited, because I had high hopes they would do it right like how David Gordon Green and Danny McBride did with the 2018 Halloween sequel, but then there was the test screen rumors that said this film was unreleasable. Then Netflix bought the rights to the film and decided to release it on their platform. Unfortunately though, I have to say, this is the worst Texas Chainsaw Massacre film I have ever seen and it is a huge insult to this iconic horror franchise. At first it started alright and even some of the kills in it were decent, but as it went on, it just got worse and worse to the point to where it was almost unwatchable. The only reason I chose to finish it was to be able to give my full review on it, but unfortunately also, it probably wasn't worth the hour and twenty one minutes that I won't get back. Rating 3/10 one of the worst horror movies I've ever watched.",2023-03-11
I actually really liked this movie. The special effects were amazing and the main characters were played well. I especially loved the bus massacre scene.,2022-03-28
"This movie almost made me cancel my Netflix subscription. I've watched some terrible movies but never have I done a review until I watched this one. I don't hate the movie, I just don't like it at all. The acting was terrible, they tried to add todays culture and make it funny but they failed. Whoever approved this movie to be made and released needs a write-up and possibly put on probation. The two main girls are the worst actors ever.",2022-04-25
"From the very first ""scary"" scene it was clear that this movie will be a very tense-edge of your sit kind of film. The scenes rolled extremely unnervingly and the situations the characters found themselves in were very smartly put together, with emphasis on small details that greatly enriched the experience and lifted it from seeming cheap. It was clearly immersed with imagination and thought. Reminds me a lot of Fede Alvarez' directing style, even though he contributed to this movie as a producer/writer rather than directing.I enjoyed the characters interaction/relationship, which added a lot to the experience of following them through the movie. They were very intertwined rather than being like domino bricks.What I didn't like was the design of leatherface... which is unfortunately a very fundamental part of the movie.And overall as much as the experience was good, it just didn't come together for me into a piece that really stands on its own and stays memorable...But it was such a ride. Atmospheric, aesthetic and thrilling. It's definitely worth watching and rewatching!",2022-02-18
"I don't followed anything about the new TCM Movie , I even never saw the Trailer but Leatherface is a Horror Icon so I have to watch this, and I was very surprised how good It was. It was fast paced , gory and thrilling. I also liked the Idea that we see a well known character from the Original (Sally Hardesty) This is what a good Reboot/Requel should look like, much better than the new Scream, don't understand the negative reviews here. Well done. I will watch it again.One more thing I never understood what people like about Michael Bays Texas Chainsaw Massacre Remake It was ok- not more, TCM2022 is much better.",2022-02-19
"Any movie that massacres influencers in the back of a disco bus has my vote ...I wanted almost every character in this movie to die... and they did...Is it anything like the original?Hell no!Is it a cheap cash grab due to the success of the new Halloween trilogy?Hell yeahhhh.Leather Face kills all but one of the obnoxious ""woke"" tropes
That's all the satisfaction I needed!",2022-02-19
"I swear to god i can make a better movie with a 50000$ budget. And To the lovely writers of this movie ""you guys are just awful"" a chimp would do a better job.",2022-07-26
It got better towards the end but there was way too many politics in the movie for it to be a horror movie. Leave horror alone and let it be out sweet escape from politics.,2022-02-22
I thought Halloween Kills was an awful movie but this one is much worse. In fact its the worst movie I've ever seen. If I could rate it in the negatives it would be in the negative hundreds. David Blue Garcia do the world a favor and never make a movie ever again. A three year old could have done a better job at making a movie.,2022-02-19
"By now you should have already accepted the fact that somehow leatherface is undead...Same as Jason and I say somehow cause they never explained it although they are both Human..
Back to the point though..I pressed play at Netflix knowing that I am going to skip skip skip but to my surprise it was actually good with fresh ideas!I admit with guilt that I enjoyed the bloody bus scene with a bunch of zoomers of the cancel generation hahaha.",2022-02-18
"One of the worse movie ever made. Whatever this movie is supposed to be, it fails on every level. It's been a messed up story, casting, acting. If you don't want to waste your time plz don't see the picture. It just killed the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise. Every second is very important so plz never try to watch this movie.",2022-02-19
"I would love to know the demographics of the people giving this movie, a rating of 3 and below. So many complaints around the modernisation of the cast and current social issues, such as racism and gentrification.Again a bunch of gammons, who are expect a horror movie to only consist of white people. So what if the lead male is black and has a white girlfriend? Everyone knows the history and hospitality of the southern tastes. Get over it.For me personally, I really enjoyed this movie! A lot of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies are awful and predicable. Bunch of kids on a road trip get slaughtered.What a liked about this movie, is they tried to introduce a different reason, as to why people have ventured into Leatherface's homeland... gentrification, which is a major sore spot of every city.Sure some acting is cheesy and of course, the existence of some characters, is purely for them to be slaughtered. But I also liked the reason why Leatherface had been not seen in a while... he was being ""looked after"".An entertaining and different take on the franchise. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2022), was never ever going to be a slick, intelligent slasher flick. But it is entertaining and gives you what you want, an average storyline you can follow and a chainsaw.Some scenes were dumb, like the people getting slaughtered in the bus. But honestly, there are worse movies, but this one is definitely above 5/10.I gave it 7, because I read the reviews of all the gammons on here, slating the movie for ""social"" reason. But it really isn't a bad movie at all, especially if you can watch a black person in a movie, (as obviously in 2022, some people cant!).Entertain, fresh and gore, (but not too much). Personally, I can't watch people being thrown onto hooks these days.",2022-03-19
"So, to start off I have seen every film but it's been awhile and I didn't think I needed to rewatch them to see this film. Boy, was I correct on that sentiment because they just took the same generic scenes and remade them with more gore. Do I appreciate the gore? Of course, but the story was lacking, the characters were annoying, the plot was full of holes, and the main ""badass"" was....lack luster at best.These young folk are the generic but also over acted annoying 20 somethings. They immediately get under your skin and make you hate them (maybe because you know all of them but one will die). The only not asshole character is the traumatized ""teen"" (the ages of these characters are honestly very confusing seeing as all of them look like children except for the girlfriend who looks older than all of them and dies first out of the friend group). They immediately irritate the only 2 locals around and think they are better than everyone. Shocker.When they are in town, they immediately start talking about how they are going to change that place for the better before even looking into any of these buildings that obviously look old and falling apart. Somehow they were able to buy (?) the entire town and then are going to auction it off to the other young people? None of those people looked old enough to even file taxes or knew how to even open a business, let alone renovate and run a whole town. But they immediately go into one of the buildings to remove a flag that would ""look bad to the buyers"".... in an abandoned town...in deep texas....um...okay. Getting past that plot hole, they meet the woman who owns the house and you get a small glimpse of leatherface. Let's not question why he is staying in an orphanage with a picture in it with a dudes face scratched out for no reason (another plothole or distraction). She says she has the deed and the dude yells at her and...leaves to call the cops? He didn't even want to see the deed? Or...what?Then you have the whole situation of the elderly woman needing to go to the hospital and then the girlfriend went with them. Why? For no other reason then to be able to text the group that the woman dies, she gets the message out there that leatherface is doing leatherface things (that would later make it to Sally) and then be the 4th death in the movie, because why not? The whole corn field scene was honestly cringe worthy to me and actually made me laugh out loud because it was so bad it made me uncomfortable.What was with the whole scene of the contractor taking the keys? Oh yes, another plothole because murder needed to happen. And so try and sum up some of this review that I may fix at a later point, why have Sally come back at all? She was a completely useless character that they tried to be epic about and then failed miserably. A strode girl, she is not.This movie was awful. So awful that I felt the need to create an account and complain about this film. Don't waste your time with this one because it's not even worth having on as background noise.",2022-07-02
"There was really no reason to make this movie. It didn't bring ANYTHING NEW to the table. It is actually boring and flat. If you read the trivia section,there is GOOD REASON this film wasn't released in theaters...it wouldn't have made more than the popcorn sales. Leatherface has ZERO intimidation in this one,and his ""face"" looks RIDICULOUS! And WHY even bring Sally back for this pile of crap??? It was almost...no...it WAS disrespectful to her character! I REALLY WANT the hour and a half of my life back that I spent watching this dumpster fire of a movie. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you watch pretty much ANY OTHER ""Chainsaw"" movie over this one...well...probably not the Matthew McConaughey one. That's all I have to say about this garbage heap.Toodles.",2022-03-08

"I love the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise for the most part. There were a couple of crappie ones ,the last one ""leatherface"" was the worst. I liked the 2013 3D and I liked this one too. The first 4 films were great, the original being the best. After saying that I enjoyed this one, not perfect but definitely watchable. Thank you for bringing this franchise back👍👏👏👏👏👍",2022-02-21
"I have only one question for the writer and director .. where is the logic?? People taking dumb decisions throughout the movie and it's kinda irritating at some point.. the original one was good because we can associate it with real life sceneries but this one is full of unrealistic drama..the actors acting is kinda ok'ish, if the script is ought to be good than the whole movie would came out to be somewhat watchable..Texas chainsaw 2013 is much more better than this movie, totally disappointed with this one.",2022-03-02

"Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a clunky franchise with currently nine entries that I enjoy to varying degrees. Tobe Hooper's original is a nightmare, fever dream masterpiece that none of its sequels can live up to. There is no way to repeat this insane lightening in a bottle - unless you have the maniacal master that is Hooper at the helm and an insane low budget shooting schedule with rotting meat on the table in the middle of the blistering Texas heat!The latest sequel is testament to this. In the original sequel (also directed by Hooper), the Cook proclaims to Leatherface, ""the saw is family."" Future sequel screenwriters need to understand that the family is also (chain)saw (the cook, the hitchhiker). It isn't Leatherface alone that makes the first film (or the batty sequels 2 - 4 somewhat) iconic. It's also the family of cannibals (Chop Top, Viggo Mortensen's Tex, Matthew McConaughey's Vilmer) that makes them special. Even the Michael Bay produced remake and its prequel understood this (Tea Lady, the great R. Lee Ermey's Sheriff Hoyt).The latest straight to Netflix entry makes the same mistakes as the previous two entries and measures up about the same. It drops the wild family members and cannibalism angle and focuses solely on Leatherface. What we're left with is a B-grade legacy storyline that sees the brief return of original final girl Sally Hardestry. The role is recast (R. I. P Marilyn Burns) and the brief stand-off with Leatherface is enjoyable but her final girl status isn't treated with the same respect afforded to the recent Halloweens' Laure Strode.We end up with a ""straight-to-video"" style Texas Chainsaw sequel with beautiful visuals, a muddled storyline and some fun, cheap grisly gore. The movie is just fine with a crazy pants Nightmare On Elm St style coda but lacking the elements that create a wholly satisfying Texas Chainsaw story. This is passable Friday night slasher fodder but it's difficult to announce that the buzz is back!DREW@WatchItWombat.",2022-02-18
"""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is an entertaining movie, but it's still just another product. The script does not present anything new for the slasher subgenre. The performances of Olwen Fouéré and Sarah Yarkin are good, the rest of the cast gives performances without further praise. The cinematography is quite successful, especially in the night scenes. David Blue García's direction is pretty weak. The new final girl played by Elsie Fisher is quite incisive. As for the gore, it contains good makeup effects, but the CG effects are bad. Definitely a fun sequel but without much quality.",2022-02-19
"Sally had the opportunity to blow away Leatherface with a shotgun, but decided to interview him instead... 3 stars purely for the bus scene. That was entertaining.",2022-02-19

"I think it's good, still doesn't beat the original or 2001 version, definitely had more kills than the last 2 films. For a gory fan I enjoyed this film. If this film had more character development it might have done better. If you like bloody movies this is it. I don't see Netflix making a sequel to this film, although fans everywhere are calling for it, leather face makes it home after many kills and bloody fights, he gets his revenge on the one that got away and I think that's enough to close this out.",2022-02-21
"Obviously it's not as good as the original but it's still good. I'm so happy that Sally Hardesty came back (even though the original actress Marilyn Burns passed away, RIP) but this movie is still great. It's brutal as hell and the ending just came out of nowhere it was very unpredictable. Just watch this movie for yourself and don't listen to these other reviews. Watch it and decide how much you like it.",2022-02-18
"The worst film I have seen of 2022. It is bland. Too many grandstandings. Do you remember my name? Seriously! It doesnt have jump scares, more comical than gory and baaad ending.The lack of redemption or confrontation as we see the permit and the sudden death of the black character is also sad that is unfinished. Talk about flaw of story telling.The man is too freakishly strong to break a bone of a sheriffs deputy with one hand. Yet the dude has a hand to hand combat with another dude.The only thing i am glad about is that the film is just under 90 minutes long. The last part where leatherface makes a ceremonial kind of chainsaw dance is more cringy and laughable than menacing.Idiot film.",2023-04-12
"This is the first time in my life that I've been provoked to write a review on a movie. I went through the process of making an account on here just for this. The short of it: the movie is just straight up bad and a complete waste of time. If I could make a time machine I'd go back to before the movie to do literally anything else with my time. As for the long of it... well:From start to finish, the characters make a lot of stupid decisions. This is what turned me off of the movie completely and left me sitting through it with a blank stare, rethinking my life. Yes, horror movies tend to have their fair share of stupidity, that's how the plot advances. However, the characters at least SOMETIMES do the right thing. In this movie? Toss that out the window! They completely turn their brains off the second they get to Harlow. Worse than that, the absolutely nonsensical choices lead the deaths in the movie to feel completely meaningless. It was like they weren't even trying to survive.One specific part that had me outraged was when the original survivor came back and didn't shoot Leatherface upon seeing him UNARMED just SITTING on the bed! After all the dramatics of her being like ""oh I need to kill him blah blah,"" she just... didn't. Then she dies?? Like what was the point of all that?? I really didn't understand that at all, not matter how I try to look at it. This is only one prevalent example I could think of, but this review would go on far too long if I listed more.Now, I'm no bigshot critic, and to be honest this is the first TCM movie I've ever seen so I don't know how they usually look, but I stand by what I said. I wish I could offer some positives but it was just terrible for numerous reasons. I'm a movie buff, I've dabbled in every genre including slasher films, so I think I know what I'm talking about when I say Netflix should get that pen from Men in Black and erase everyone's memories after this experience.",2023-07-30
"This is a Texas chainsaw movie with no good aspects from the original ones.

You either like or hate this classic remake. I loved it because it stayed true to form. I love the franchise and thos one did not disappoint. Highly recommend.,2022-02-23
Psycho killerThis is termed to be a sequel for the previous Texas Chainsaw movie - just the pause button is resumed kind of plot.The killer does kill people who come to the town and the upgrade is more victims this time.There were only bloodsheds and as usual everyone gets killed on the chainsaw. This time a bunch of victims appear in front of the killer and he does his job there as well.Another usual plot where one person to claim himself who could save the ladies and gets killed shortly. Again 2 girls to get in trap and run for life and hide at useless places.One additional concept is sequel and a character to play from previous part - who asked it to be?Dont want to speak about the climax - no director is different as they wish the killers are their leads and keep them survived even if they are hit by train or fall from planes or shot by RPG on chest...,2022-02-23
"Bad movie? Yes. As bad as everyone is making it seem? No.The movie try's to incorporate woke culture and relevant topics which was completely unnecessary and cringey, but I don't see how this movie is any different from recent slashers.It got straight to the point and gave a really cool look at leather face. I mean this guy is extremely scary and they did a great job using his size to strike fear into the audience.Besides him the only other character I found likeable was actually the native Texan who is probably a bad person but at least in the time of chaos tried to step up for the judgy ""influencers""Was also strange how the main girl looked like jodie foster. Was that intentional?To end this off I really think slashers should try and go back to mostly practical effects with the occasional aid of cgi. If they want to keep these movies low budget and entertaining, maybe just get creative? Maybe idk what I'm talking about but these types of movies just do not have the same feel as their predecessors.",2022-02-27
"Within the first 5 minutes the main characters start a fight with a local who didn't interact with them at all, insult him as a person when he passes them on a long, empty road, trespassed into someone's home to steal their Confederate flag, and cussed out an old woman. If they wanted you to hate the characters that are gonna start dying they did a great job.",2022-03-05
"I wasnt sure what to expect from the trailer. The two sisters are plain looking but the characterization is well done. I expected an extremely negative take on rural people, but that did not happen. The young kids were portrayed as headstrong and condescending, so I thought it was another movie where I looked forward to them dying, but they definitely won me over. The setting, and mood was dark and scary. The horror was awesome with a lot of blood and gore. Definitely worth your time if you enjoy this type of horror.",2022-02-20
"Before the race and social justice brigade chimes in i'm not rating this because the first male character showcased is black. It's the fact that the script is so completely loaded with modern white liberal interpretations of what America ""wants to see"" in entertainment that it has become schizophrenic. Nothing seems authentic. All dialogue seems loaded. Everything seems like it was tested to a an audience who didn't remember this weird fake stuff wasn't the norm.",2022-02-19
"The original TCM is a masterpiece and one of the best horror movies ever created. This film was not thatTexas Chainsaw Massacre is a scam. It's hardly even a movie since its only concern is violence. There are some minimal attempts at hackneyed characters and plot but the plot is incredibly confusing, the attempts at it are extremely shallow and swiftly abandoned. A vast majority of the film's very short runtime is solely dedicated to repetitive Leatherface attacks, which might sound enticing but gets old fast. These characters are awful and I'm glad Leatherface killed them, they tried to make a 2018 Halloween style reboot but it's cringe, there's literally a line in this movie where a guy is live streaming Leatherface and he says ""try anything and you're canceled bro."" It is so cringey.There's a scene where the O. G Sally Hardesty gets the chainsaw completely through the torso and should've died immediately, but she survives.This movie is the worst one since Matthew McConaughey's abomination, and I'm gonna give Texas Chainsaw Massacre a D-",2022-03-13
"When is Hollywood going to learn. The first 5 or so minutes of this movie is like a BLM activist vomited onto a reel of film. Seriously! It's so bad and transparent that it's laughable. But the ignorance is so strong that the remainder of the film actually becomes a massive advertisement for why the 2nd Amendment matters so much and undoes so much leftist narrative. The guns that are supposedly so ""dangerous"" can't even bring down a person. And the most useless of them all in the film? The big bad AR15 which does nothing. Hahahahaha! Hilarious!",2022-02-26
"I expected a simple plot, loads of gore and plenty of chainsaw fodder and that is exactly what I got. It didn't pretend to be anything other than what it is and what is always was. Just enjoy it, don't overthink it.",2022-02-21
"Im not that much of a horror movie watcher so i watched it with no expectations, the killing was the only thing entertaining to me plus the dolphin dive that Bubba did in the end.The acting was okay most of the time but literally every character acts like they only have one braincell left.There was an absence of any storyline throughout the entire film from start to finish not to mention the completely ludicrous scenarios and plot armour the two sisters had until the last scene.For some magical reasons every character could survive with deadly wounds way too long when they shouldve been dead since minutes. Also why did the bus driver leave the bus just to get killed? And why is no one of the 20 people capable of atleast trying to attack the killer?No one seemed to miss the blonde girl either and do they only have two police people or why did no one come after ages?",2023-06-26
"I just wasn't feeling this one.I'm sure a part of it is because I've been mildly disappointed with every Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie that followed the original so my already low expectations didn't even give this one a chance, but still.I sat through the movie waiting for those ""oh wow...uh-oh...aghhhh"" reactions and they never came.",2022-02-23
Truly one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.Not one character is likable or interesting and there is no plot to speak of.Totally useless and boring.,2022-07-11
"Hardly any merit for this atrocity...I've awarded two stars for the very few moments of suspense (forget moments of horror or discomfort - there aren't any) and the presence of Moe Dunford and Alice Krige...the only saving graces I could find in this shlock.A terrible entry into the long list of disappointing sequels and reimaginings thrown out since the (brilliant) original classic horror...none of the characters are interesting, the storyline is weak and simply served as a vehicle to get to the nasty parts, the nasty parts are silly and unbelievable and halfway through I wanted to turn it off because I was so bored...I found it to be a real insult to the pure dread and creative terror that the first film brought. The final ten minutes were particularly cringeworthy, with social commentary totally out of place in this film and then made worse with...well, remember 'Halloween 5'? Exactly...The late, great Marilyn Burns surely would've been disappointed...again. Sally certainly is deserving of better...it's like the Mona Lisa - repainted by a 3 year-old.",2022-03-03
Hopped out of the water like a literal SEAL.Alright movie. The bloodbath in the bus was kinda fun and the gore was nice.I also couldn't help but laugh when the main character for flung down the stairs like a rag doll.,2022-02-26
"This is the worst installment yet. Not only will you find the most detestable characters in a single film, the plot and acting are also ridiculously outrages. This film is a disgrace to the franchise. The only thing to like is to see the characters get slaughtered.",2022-03-30
"Man what an entirely dull movie this was, the gore was great but that's about it. The story was...not good and could've been much better. The actual location looked like it was and probably was built on a parking lot, it didn't seem like a little American Town even though I'm from Scotland. The only decent thing and I mean it was the end credits all flashing and bloodied tools. I thought that was cool. Would I watch a sequel...probably but just for the gore !",2022-02-20
"I'm a huge horror movie fan and have been for a while. Going into this movie, I had no expectations. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie and think it's the best sequel than the original. If you are worried this is a cliche movie of ""legacy character comes back years later to finally kill the bad guy"", don't be, it's more.P. S. Carnage candy galore!!!!",2022-02-18
Don't waste 83 minutes of your life. Incredibly bad. Amazed Netflix are actually prepared to screen dross like this. Only spoiler in this review points to the fact it is awful in just about every way.,2022-02-22
"It's supposed to be a sequel to that time a bunch of hillbilly cannibals killing a bunch of people with a chainsaw and at them. But no, Netflix wasn't having any of that. Why waste a chance to show the world how woke they are???*SPOILERS* in less than 10 minutes they were super in your face about as many buzz topics as they could layer into that short amount of time. Starting with the big bad terrible man with the American flag hat, segueing into their blatant attacks on gun rights, right into them alluding to the fact that they only got pulled over because the guy driving was black. Peppered in between those was an electric car, interracial couple, possible trans kid and, of course, blind anger over someone's display of a confederate flag. Come on. It's a movie about psychos wielding chainsaws and it's set in Texas, not Chaz. Stop with the wokeness. We all hate it.",2022-02-20
"Keyword there - SLASHER. This is a slasher film. If you have no appreciation for the genre, move along. If your tastes and intellect are based more for drama, romance, superhero films, whatever; move along. This film is so undeserving of the hate other reviewers have given it.This is practically a perfect slasher film. Legendary villain, awesome backstory, fantastic pacing, intense chase scenes, dreaded tension, AMAZING gore, brilliant setting, great cast.. Honestly this is what slasher fans have been waiting for.Not one dull moment. And thank you to the makers for making a straightforward slasher film, that is rare nowadays without some stupid biased political message or steeped in irony and comedy. This really should have a much higher rating.Definitely the best of the Texas sequels. I'm sure idiots who don't appreciate this genre will downvote this review but for those who love the genre, you can't miss this. Hoping they get the same director for a sequel, I'll be checking out his future work for sure.",2022-04-13
"I think we can all say we're here for the killing and gore, so at the very least this movie can deliver there.The rest is certified F-tier garbage that makes you question who gets paid to write this.There's not a single character that is likeable or that you might root for; not a single scene that is original or thrilling; they couldn't even be bothered to write something more original than the ""protagonist/antagonist falls into water seemingly dead"" trope. What a waste of its runtime.Straight garbage, no wonder this was straight to streaming.",2022-02-20
"This is the perfect film for you. Seriously, I've been watching horror films since the 70's and I cannot, for the life of me, remember such a ridiculous ensemble of morons.Unlike the original and many other films of this genre where it doesn't matter what you do - the odds are just stacked against you, this cast go out of their way to be killed. No avoidance, no communication, no double taps.It's popcorn horror. Watch it and forget it. Which is a shame because there is some real talent here.",2022-02-20
Well worth a watch for any TCM fans! Some unreal graphic death scenes with great special effects! Maybe they'll finally end the series with this one??,2022-02-19
"This was entertaining Throughout my it's runtime. Had great pacing. Good gore and kills. 1st TCM movie to have an actual massacre in it. Good revenge plot, but this could of been anyone copying the Leatherface approach. Felt a little rushed in terms of why the character was doing the whole Leatherface thing, but who cares? It's just a bit of daft slasher entertainment. Doesn't have to be a masterpiece.",2022-02-18
"My expectations were quite low after seeing the trailer and reading the movie description prior to release. This was a good horror film, much to my surprise. The special effects, gore, and plot exceeded my low expectations, and I genuinely enjoyed the movie.",2022-02-21
These dumb people don't know anything about this franchise and it's funny 😂 it isn't the greatest story but there was plenty of story plus the kill was wayyy more then any of the others but for this to get hated on worse then leatherface or 3D is stupid it's great and is what a leatherface movie is a slasher i was happy that I even feel this revamped the Texas chainsaw movies.,2022-02-19
The initial premise seemed interesting but everything unravels fairly quickly.Ultimately this is a case of stupid characters making stupid decisions in a stupid plot.,2022-02-25
"This movie delivers exactly what you expect if you have seen all the previous 8 installments. The difference is that the gore effects, filming quality, and general short and sweet runtime, keeps the entertainment mark on this one higher than many of the previous iterations. Some of the previous ones were more thrilling, and had good story and obviously much better characters. This one skips any real thriller set-up or creative character story (although Alice K kept a nice bit of the theme alive), and instead gets right down to business, and it was awesome! This movie knows what it is, and a bunch of unlikable and/or whiney inept characters made a great chainsaw buffet. Very entertaining. It's not a smart movie, it's just an entertaining, and well shot installment to the series to keep the fun alive... with outstanding gore effects.",2022-02-24
"Not much to say here folks, the direction was surprisingly poor. The characters were 1 dimensional and really forgettable. And Leatherface was nouthing special either, hes just anouther version of Micheal Myers but a generic version of Micheal Myers. The script was also Awful. And nouthing really happened. Also some scenes were good, so was the bit near the end that's why I give it a 2, but it's still horrendous filmmaking, and an unesasary remake of the old films, which I will admit I've not seen. So if your a fan of the original movies AVOID THIS ONE AT ALL COST!!!, don't say I didn't warn you.",2022-03-05
A bunch of millenials trying to stay alive without even trying . I dont know why but after a while when your life is at risk you try everything in order to survive but in this case in this movie every character will not fight or run from death . Bad story the worst of all with minimal effort on new ideas . I think they try to fit in with the new generation of viewers but at the end hardcore fans embrace this genre not influencers and snowflakes.,2022-03-19
"This was one of the worst movies I have seen lately. What can I expect from an horror film? Not much but hey. This was just terrible. As many said. Awful decisions from everyone in the movie. The level of realism is in the scale of 1/10. I know it is a movie but the bad guy was about to get shot, then the good guy decided to fight him instead. Then was was at 1 click dead from a shotgun and let escape after 50 years. Latter in the film he just ran with a chainsaw to face someone with a shogun who misses al shots. Then he gets almost rammed by a truck but he manages to escape with a chainsaw throw (which uses later to throw at the floor at the protaonist), then he gets shot twice with a shotgun in the chest, doesn't die. Then he gets hit with a chainsaw on his face and drop into the water, sinks. Doesn't die. The movie is just horrendous and irritating to watch.",2022-02-21
"Leatherface is a durable and strong guy, but he had never been a Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees until this movie. If you don't have any supernatural power you just die after being shot like threece and eventually drowning in water.",2022-02-18
Gory slasher with great kills and intense sequences for any Chainsaw fan. Love the focus on Leatherface definitely gives him the stalker Micheal Myers or Jason feel that I don't really get from him in his other Chainsaw films. If you came for a fun filled body count enjoy!,2022-02-20
Not sure what's wrong with the people that trolled this movie so hard. It was entertaining. It was creepy. It was scary. It has LOTS of jump scenes. And it has characters that are relatable that make you scream at the TV hoping they'll listen to you. I love the fact that the makers of the movie brought Sally back to let us see a little of what became of her. I would totally watch this again.,2022-02-22
As stupid as it is bloody. Add some fairly decent despite cheesy acting and you've got yourself a entertaining 80 minute slasher flick. Ignore all the hate from Texas Chainsaw Massacre over-enthusiasts. If you like slashers films this one is fine.,2022-03-15
"I watched this with my brother on netflix last month and I was appalled, the characters were so annoying the acting itself was really subpar and honestly just cringeworthy. I hate using that would but that is literally the only word that I can think of that suits this movie. Honestly the best part of the movie was towards the end and even that wasn't great. I hate this whole ""content creator"", ""City Boy, City Girl"" stuff they did to these characters and it's just something almost impossible to just look over because the movie keeps shoving it down your throat. It's clear they weren't thinking about longevity and were just finding a way to shill the *heck* out of a famous horror title. The only thing that saved this movie was being able to laugh at it with my brother. Jaxon thank you! Do not recommend.",2023-05-17
"I gave this movie a six !Atleast the killer wasnt a racist who got killed by his victims of racial discrimination, who also declares they hate America and all other countries are better.But seriously it was so ridiculous!",2022-02-18
"Take it for what it is, these movies are made to be enjoyable if you're a huge fan of slashers.Its also supposed to be big in the legacy aspect but don't let that drive you while watching this, its a hell of a good time with BRUTAL kills and that ending caught me by surprise and I can say I was a big fan of it.The cinematography is one of the best aspects of this film.",2022-02-18

"One time I was riding a moped in Hawaii and the throttle got stuck. I was hurtling around this winding road gaining more speed with every second. It also happened to be raining. On one side of me was a steep drop off, the other side a sheer mountain face. As I fishtailed around a turn I dumped the moped on its side going about 35mph. I immediately shattered both my patella and elbow as I crashed into the unforgiving pavement, my shoes popping off my feet from the impact almost cartoonishly. I had road rash over almost the entirety of my body and began vommitting uncontrollably as the moped laid on its side next to me, wheels still spinning.If given the choice between watching this movie again or rebreaking most of my body I would choose the moped 10 times out of 10.",2022-02-20
"Not that I expected very much, but there are enough genuine good moments to make the movie as a whole very frustrating. The surprises are all non-surprises, you see them coming from down the block and around the corner. There's some suspense, but the focus seems to be mainly on brutality. One or two character development points are winning, but otherwise, it's hard to like or feel much sympathy for any of the characters, and I've had enough of killers that ""die"" and return as though they hadn't got a scratch on them.Can we please stop having these sequels/remakes/reboots/ whatever from people who have noo understanding of what made the originals such classics? Bah - this is a time-waster. See something else.",2022-02-26

"Gory factor was on point but that's about all that was decent about this film and the poor acting took this film to a whole other level. I had high hopes for this ""reboot"" but was sadly disappointed.",2022-02-19
"This .. whatever it is just makes you feel like you could have done something else besides watching it. The storyline is very rushed and unreal in anyway whatsoever. Unfortunatley the young cast's acting is not good either, maybe they could have saved the film but it is just bad. Rushed and pointless to be honest.",2022-02-23
"This is easily one of the most hilarious experiences a viewer could have watching a movie. Despite genuinely entertaining kills this film presents, this movie contains characters that are painful to watch, logic defying scenes, terrible dialogue, and a disrespectful plot to accompany the original. Where the original film had a disturbing documentary style, that through its simplicity, managed to disturb any viewer who saw it, this film takes the route of trying to modernize the source material in the worst way possible. Through its preaching of social commentary, overly complicated plot, and lacking basic subtleties, this film can only be enjoyed for those wishing to turn their brains off and mock the complete insanity of this movie.",2022-02-28
"If I could envision the room when this movie was being pitched it would be a bunch of hipsters sitting in LA with tight jeans, carhartt beanies, and little interest in a story, but more so a message on how disenfranchised various groups are. This movie sucks, just to be blunt. The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre had so much atmosphere about it that you felt the suspense. In this installment I genuinely couldn't care less about the characters because frankly the story doesn't give me a good reason to care for them. They are a diverse group of influnecers coming to the middle of nowhere texas to get people interested in food? The only thing that was massacred here was the name of the franchise, and thats who I feel bad for. Honestly skip it if you are hoping for something even close to the original.",2022-02-20

"Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2022) a bland, obnoxiously woke, rip-off of a classic. It brought nothing new to the film except for a Tesla. Minus the overly social/political nature of the movie, it completely missed the mark. Another Netflix remake that makes B movies look award winning. I went ahead and watched the whole thing to see if it got any better, nope. Can confirm, did not get better. What it lacks in character dynamics, it also lacks in quality storytelling.",2022-02-23
"Pop-culture witty humor has absolutely no place in a Texas Chainsaw Massacre film. The plot (if you can call it that) has absolutely nothing to do with any of the films and you could realistically replace Leatherface with any blank face killer. You actively WANT all of the characters to die, which obviously removes any chance of tension or suspense. Some people will tell you it's ""fun"" or ""has good kills"" but I'm not sure if they watched the same movie as I did, it's a snooze fest start to finish. I highly recommend this movie to everyone who cares about the film industry so they can witness exactly what horror fans do not want.",2022-02-25
"This is not a bad horror film sequal. My problem is that chainsaws simply cannot cut through metal pipes and car doors. The blades will simply disintegrate.Also, disappointingly (SPOILER ALERT) leatherface comes back after being chainsawed himself and drownd. Typical. No doubt leaving room for a sequel. Shame, as it would have been a much better ending with him dying.",2022-02-20
"Ridiculous storyline its like they punched it out in a day, no suspense whatsoever just a mindless gorefest but not in a fun way its just extremely frustrating and stupid.",2022-02-23
"This was debatably the worst horror film I've ever seen. I'd never seen the TCM films prior to this, so perhaps my expectations were too high. But I can definitely say this will be my last. Don't waste your time trying to decipher this film's stupidity. I feel like I've lost respect for myself knowing I sat through this whole movie. Don't be a victim of this film like me. A lady literally picks up a shotgun and shoots Leatherface after he sawed her in half and launched her 50ft. (I guess he's got super strength and regeneration abilities?) Terrible movie with a terrible plot with terrible actors.",2022-09-25
"I'mnot aware of the course the franchise has taken from the original Tobe Hooper's film onwards and I think I can say I wasn't expecting anything from this latest installment.My first impression is that of a very vapid cinema experience, and that thin substance the film has must be related to the historic architecture it's part of. So, that must be forgiven. Still, the film is also making very little effort to present itself as an interesting object per se and ends up being totally forgettable. That is less forgivable.As someone pointed out, the figure of Leatherface is only bearing meaning when placed in the context of a family of which he's only an element, and a very subordinate one, simple-minded, assisted and used. Seeing him taking a whole script in charge is weird and unrealistic, it can only open to very simplified narrative ways , and it does in this film.What you get is a systematic butchery; every chance is given to the maniac to harvest as many victims as possible. It is all what it's about: a bloody bodycount without goal, direction, and worse: without emotion or soul. All the sense of dread and unease the seminal T. H's film conveyed is gone with the super caricatured characters that lidicrously seem to fall victims to their multiculturalism/woke/me-too leanings in favor of the down-to-earth, reasonable conservatism of born-from-the-fields Leatherface (as one of the sequences suggests).Poor acting performances overall, not a trace of anxiety, cartoon-like situations, poor plot, good cinematography though and full unashamed effective gory scenes. The film catches your interest during 25 minutes, it is tiring for the rest, and in all its shortness, it still seems very long.",2022-02-21
"Too many remakes are being made. No good ideas to try, plus the ending was terrible. And made no sense. Millennials out here just don't even think in movies. Gotta come up with something way better than that.",2022-02-18
"Every character seemed to be as dumb as the next one with an exception for the two sisters and the truck driver. How is Leatherface able to stand up after taking 2 shotgun shots, being knocked out by his chainsaw and left for to drown.Also setting the film in modern day would have made more sense if it did add more to the plot, which it didn't. The film also just glossed over the woman they introduced as Leatherface's care giver instead of addressing her appropriately as a character.Kudos to the violence and the gory aspects of the film as well as the cinematography. They sure did get that right.",2022-11-28
"BAD.I wasn't expecting much, because the trailer made it clear that this one is no where near to the previous ones. But still I didn't expect it to be this bad. Everyone is so dumb in this film. It has soooo many stupid moments starting from this Massacre man (feels more like a silly big man). The bus scene is one of the dumbest things in this film. There were like 20+ people in that bus, they could've easily all just jump at him and punch him as hard as they could, but instead they were acting really dumb. That old lady just came and die. Really she did nothing. The ending is even more dumb. This movie doesn't even feel like Texas Chainsaw Massacre.",2022-02-24
"This film creates a direct link to the original Massacre. If your a fan of slasher, gore films than it delivers. It also brings Leatherface into the ""Cancel Culture"" age.",2022-03-06
"Weak story that doesn't really make any sense in a lot of ways, for example in this one leatherface is in a picture as a kid at the orphanage, which indicates he was raised there since he was already a grown man in the past movies. Also a lot of weird unrealistic moments like for example; when a woman gets her belly cut she died instantly with her eyes open.The original is a lot better but the best one is the one from 2003, in my opinion.",2022-02-18
"An entire cast of bull dikes, and a hideously fugly main character, none of whom you care anything about. You actually want them to die!I give the story 5 stars, but the cast zero, bringing it down to 2.5 stars.But the very end was such a delightful surprise that it deserves at least a couple more, and bring it back up to 5.",2022-05-08
"The original Texas chainsaw massacre is one of my favorite movies of all time. This is because its extremely raw but it doesn't need extreme gore in order to be disturbing. It has a dirty aura that makes you feel uncomfortable during the whole film. Sally Hardesty is probably one of my favorite slasher survivors because of Marilyn Burns's incredible performance.Now, this is probably the worst way to finish Sally's story. Its almost pathetic how quickly she is killed and does absolutely nothing useful. Ignoring that, the movie is atrocious. Bad performances, made with absolutely no intelligence, predictable, terrible characters and ridiculous.",2023-07-04
Much more than I thought I would!! A cool final girl and nods to the original. Great fun on the bus when everyone starts filming instead of running for their lives. It also manages to avoid leaning on jump scares! A nice reboot of the series!,2022-02-18
"The people in this movie don't know how to break a car window, and when they seem to have died, they always come back for one last shot.Still it was nice to see leatherface again, being the best part of the movie, the actor did a great job playing the character from the original movies.",2022-02-18
The people who are talking about the story line i mean guys we all know people are gonna die what do you expect but we will come back to it later 1 st thing damn!!!! The kills are soo gory its been years thet this level of gore released the place the ambient its dark now the story its normal kinda expected but yeah the last paart is totally unexpected use of latest technology of this genration ambience is also well used overall its a good 1 time watch if you want some CHILLZZZ !!!!!!,2022-02-19
I love the Texas Chainsaw franchise and was looking forward to seeing this new one. I was highly disappointed with what they did to this movie. The characters were incredibly annoying and I was happy when each one was killed off. To say any more about this hot mess is a waste of time.,2022-02-19
"I didn't expect much from this movie but it's OK. Far fetched, gory and at times funny this is a decent effort. It could have been a disaster, why mess with the original from 50 years ago? But the story is fine, the acting decent and Leatherface suitably creepy.Many will of course hate this, I didn't. It is no masterpiece but at least something happens in this which is more than can be said about a couple of movies the critics have raved about. Yes. 'Power Of The Dog' and 'The Lost Daughter' I am looking at you.",2022-02-19

"A ghost town ripe for development isn't actually as abandoned as the group of 'influencers' thought when a girl with PTSD, her sister and friends find themselves facing off against the monstrous Leatherface, who nearly 50 years ago went on a murder rampage.Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2022 thankfully doesn't disregard to its own time logic with the age of its lead character like 2013's offering, but it doesn't have the tension or thrill or 2003's Marcus Nispel outing. Without drawing any further comparisons to the other sequels and reboots it ignores, director David Blue Garcia with a visual eye offers a great looking and staged film. Ricardo Diaz's cinematography is note worthy, if stylised. It looks great, sets, locations and lighting. The music by Colin Stetson is on point and complements the mayhem and few subtle moments. The special effects are first rate and offer some genuine wincing moments, even your left a little bit numb by them by the closing act. Also Garcia's sequel lacks that hot Texas feel and it hasn't got the roughness or grit of its 1974 predecessor.Mark Burnham plays old Leatherface with a fitting new mask effortlessly right down to a slight limp caused in the original. He's not an enforcer here, he's simply looking after his mother at an orphanage, that is until Fede Álvarez and Rodo Sayague real estate plot pulls him out of 'retirement'! Olwen Fouéré plays Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns passed away in 2014) this was a great opportunity to bring back the character even if a little predictable in the wake of the recent Halloween (2018) and lacklustre Terminator: Dark Fate (2019) reviving original leads. However, Fouéré is solid but is completely underused, yes she turns up at the right moment and also gets a (little illogical anti-climatic) showdown; but it's mostly an extended cameo of repeatedly looking at an old Polaroid of the original's characters. There's no mention of Drayton Sawyer or Grandpa (presumably dead), oddly , as they were as much to blame as Leatherface in the original.Chris Thomas Devlin's screenplay to his credit does play with expectations synonymous with the genre especially with the few locals. However, getting under the skin of the film, the issue with Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2022 is certainly not Garcia's direction or Álvarez and Sayague's story per se, although it would have been easier to swallow with estate agents rather than 'influencers' and the aforementioned Hardesty issue. It's not the acting either, it's the characters in Devlin's script. Sarah Yarkin as Melody and Elsie Fisher as her sister Lila along with the other characters including Jacob Latimore as Dante, are forced to be modern millennial and relatable protagonists, but they just come of as unlikable. Social commentary is thrown down the views throat. Development is dropped as soon as the killing starts. Dante's partner Ruth (well played by Nell Hudson) is killed off. There's no punch to it without Dante being present.Notable is actor Moe Dunford who is great as Richter, set up as a unsavoury local but turns out to be likable handy-man mechanic. Alice Krige as Virginia is impressive, William Hope as Sheriff is excellent; but anyone who has any credence is killed off pretty quick and their screen time cut prematurely short. As a nod, John Larroquette reprises his role as the original film's narrator.It follows the playbook of gruesome kills... it's gory, a hammer, cleaver, axe, cork screw, bone crushing and snapping action. Memorably, when Leatherface brings out his old favourite chainsaw, there's a slaughter on a bus of all the Gen Z, heads in their phone, background characters reminiscent of Predator 2's (1990) subway, Blade's (1999) nightclub, even Rogue One/Mandalorian's corridor deaths. Ageist folk may get a kick out of this; but I'm not to sure about the young adults that the film is predominantly aimed at.Even with grief-stricken Leatherface shot, stabbed and slashed- it finishes with a horror 'twist' end and callback antics only topped with a chainsaw decapitation. There's also an after credit Rambo-eques scene where Leatherface returns home.Overall, it's a pleasant ride, well produced and directed, while being respectful to the original. Garcia and company offer some great visual moments. Nevertheless, with so many similarly looking modern horror films in the same vein it's not enough to elevate this above its contemporaries aside from it's connection with Tobe Hooper's visceral pitted original. Recommend but with caution.",2022-02-23
"Here is yet another another franchise ruined by liberal racism and self righteous fake sjw nonsense being forced into a movie where it doesn't belong. The acting is terrible, the main cast have no chemistry and just dont look the part. The writing is laughable and childish. The special effects were the only decent aspect of this epic failure.",2022-06-10
"Lesser Halloween 2018, or what some are calling Texas Chainsaw Massacre, is most certainly what it is. It is not groundbreaking. It is not something you sit through for the Academy Award worthy screenplay. It is something that you sit through for the effective scares and the good kills and blood. The original movie was never a powerful story but a masterclass of tension and dread and despair and that is what 2022's Texas Chainsaw Massacre has to live up to and it does. Other than the delightful 2003 remake this is the best TCM has been since the original. It is fun. It is scary. It is gory. It is mean and brutal. It is Leatherface in top form. Do not expect philosophical meditations on life that will make you think when you are done. Sit down and enjoy the ride with the best TCM in almost 20 years.",2022-02-19
"Despite the fact it has been 50 years now this TCM has definitely brought the franchise up a little bit, the killing of 1974 heroine was disappointing but leatherface performance was powerful as if a new him was born.",2022-02-21
"It was one of the worst horror/ films I have watched in years. Appalling that this is even supposed to be associated with Texas chainsaw massacre. It was cheesy, predictable and boring because of the lack of suspense.",2022-02-22
"I was eight years old when my uncle Farquhar forced me to watch the original movie. He said it would toughen me up, when it actually made me soil my bed for two years straight. So much so, my nanny resigned due to the smell alone. Blast! Anyhoots, the original was scary due to its realism, the genuine helplessness of the teens and that it was easy to imagine one could quite easily end up in the situation depicted. If you've ever been to Hull or Chicago, you'll know what I mean. This movie however, fails to evoke any of the originals strengths and dilutes the movie into a woke cesspool of foolery. Leather Face has been transformed into a Jason from Friday 13th clone, the teens are a bunch of soy latte drinking swamp donkeys you'll not care about as they're being butchered and the old fart who turns up to kill Leather Face has the intelligence of a squashed grape. I was so disappointed at this pile of trash, I kicked my butler down three flights of stairs and kicked him square in the plums. The original is a classic car, this on the other hand is a urine soaked hat. Poop!",2022-02-23
"Nothing has ever got me so underwhelmed that I've actually even considered writing a review but here we are this film was filled with so much stupidity I thought it was a parody.It wasn't the actors as the story, rushed, recycled content.Can we have something new ??",2022-02-22
"As a fan of the TCM movies, hearing the development hell this movie went through gave me some pretty low expectations. And while it plays out more like a traditional slasher flick like Friday the 13th more than a TCM movie, and despite it's handful of flaws that hold it back. This film is a harmless and enjoyable waste of time.",2022-02-19
"The only good things about this movie are the kills. This movies four biggest flaws are 1. It´s way too similar to Halloween 2018. It´s a sequal to the originl movie, the killer returns in his 70s after not killing anyone since the first movie and the main character from the first movie returns to kill the killer. 2. The movie just drops some sorylines, Sally is built up to have an epic fight with Leatherface, only to be easily killed. The main character survived a school shooting, but it barely ads anything to the story, she doesn´t want to use guns but then she does. 3. Melody is annoying as hell. She insults a guy she does´nt know, because he has a gun in a city where there´s a serial killer who uses a chainsaw. And for some reason she decides to stay in the house with the old lady oter Dante leaves. 4. Leatherface is overpowerd. He´s supposed to be in his 70s, but able to run pretty fast. And he also survives TWO shotgun shots to the stomache wich would oblitirate his internal organs. And the last scene of the feels like it was supposed to be a fakeout or a dream, but it wasn´t. The acting is fine.",2022-03-27
"Every time there's a new ""TCM"" movie I have high hopes. And I'm always let down. Though I did like ""Texas Chainsaw"" as bad as it was. At least it was unique. This here is nothing more than typical. And sorry. Leatherface is over 70, has always been out of shape. Yet you mean to tell me this fat old man has the strength and speed he had in 1974 when he was in his 20's GTFOH. He should have succumbed to type two diabetes by now. 👀",2022-02-18
"This movie is getting a lot of s**t, especially for being woke. It is a bit jarring but does feature some awesome scenes, one being the bus slaughter scene which is SO today, it's how us IG generation would react.

"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise has been through hell and back, with prequels like ""Leatherface"" and sequels such as ""Texas Chainsaw 3D."" This film is the only sequel that captures what the only film ever had which was the simplicity, and of course, along with some bloody-fun kills. The film effortlessly captures the atmosphere of the first which seemed like the other films lacked, and we all feel like we had lost something towards the ending like the first! I have no idea how this film is getting worse and worser reviews by the minute but I personally feel that this was the best since the original film! I hope that one day in the future, this film will somehow gain a cult-following.",2022-02-20
"The film had the right look, the acting was good, it was the right length. It kind of missed the point and brilliance of the original.I can appreciate the almost impossible task of breathing life back into a franchise. One can be lucky if even a third of the fans of the original of any get behind it. The movie did what it set out to do in that it was bloody and entertaining. Some good nods to the original throughout. But it failed as it relied on gore and body count, where as the original barely had either.Hooper managed to pull of a sense of slow burn and dread without relying on any of the tropes that it is strangely credited with starting. The sense of the otherworldly and hopelessness does not show up in the new one as it did the original. While this new one does have a bit of a sense of humor, it does not have the utter lunacy that the family created so well in the original.If you do not compare it to the original it is fine and it checks several interesting horror boxes.",2022-02-22
Everyone in the movie acted more oblivious than the original characters. The whole come back was supposed to be this great thing but it was anticlimatic. The fact that she could have killed Bubba right then and there but was to focused with glory she got everyone killed. The killing was obviously intense. It feels like they focused more on the killing scenes than making the movie actually good. :(,2022-02-23
"Seriously, all the bad reviews are talking about how it doesn't match up to the original, or how the stories don't match, or how it's another bad sequel. Stop rating a movie based on its relation to the others. Rate it based on the actual movie, the actors, the originality. This movie has outstanding new actors and great gore/thrills. Enjoy the damn movie and stop comparing things.",2022-02-21
A few graphic and creative kill scenes but all in all a disappointing plot and poorly executed. All hype and no delivery. A sad modernized chapter for an iconic classic story.,2022-03-26
"Yes I am a horror fan and yes I loved this version of TCM. It's gory, it's bloody, it makes no sense but it gets to the point or should I say the slice and dice quickly. If you expect a deep complex story line than pass. Netflix knows their audiences well enough so much so that it is the #2 most watched movie based on the 1-10 ratings.",2022-02-24
"Idk why people are acting as if a masterpiece was expected from this movie. It's not amazing, but I was surprised by how much I liked it. It's not very preachy or ""woke""; at least not enough for it to be annoying or feeling as if it's getting shoved in your face, so that's not an issue at all, and it's rather refreshing, cause I was expecting it to be way worse in that departmentThe kills are magnificent, brutal, and malicious! It shows that this movie is worthy of the title it holds. Especially the bus scene...holy cow! The acting from the main young cast was surprisingly good, as well as the cinematography was actually pretty good too. There are a few shocking scenes that you don't see coming. Be sure to stick around for the ending, you wouldn't wanna miss it.Also there is a very brief after credits scene if you wanna check that out. I'd watch it again, I'd buy it too if it was ever going to be released on DVD or digital. If slasher movies, guts, and gore galore is your thing, then look no further. You will definitely have a fun ride while watching the movie.",2022-02-18
I almost turned this off about 15 minutes in because the protagonists were a bunch of stereotypical whiny millennials. Seriously the most annoying characters that I can remember seeing in several years of horror movies. They make a big fuss about tearing down an old crusty confederate flag and guns are bad etc etc. There self righteousness causes an old woman to drop dead out of shear disgust and then Leatherface shows up to cancel their culture. I never cheered so loudly for the antagonist in my entire 43 years of movie viewing. It's not the best entry in the franchise but it's definitely worth a watch. Especially if you hate dirty hipsters.,2022-02-19
"The reviews here make you seem like this is gonna be the worst horror movie you'll watch but it's not as I've worse movies than this. I don't know what these people were expecting but i got what i signed up for i.e., leatherface chopping off bunch of dumb people with his chainsaw.Yes there are plot holes & some dumb decisions from characters which is obvious for horror movies. I think the only drawback was that the movie make you root for leatherface & you do not care about a single character. Still this is a good popcorn film. Not scary but fast paced with good gore.This is not the worst texas chainsaw film I've watched. I'll recommend it if you're a slasher fan & looking for a short fun horror film. A solid 6 for me!",2022-02-27

"For all of those upset about the woke aspect of the film... Did you even watch the movie? It fairly, and openly condemmed those people as cattle for leatherface to slaugther. It's hilarious to me that that is a reason it wasn't liked. Gory as hell and it gets Leatherface better than any sequel has.",2022-02-19

"...They had 48 years to come up with a decent sequel!! 48 years!!!!!!!!!!!! How could so many people produce, write and direct a movie that is just that god awful.

"When studios are rebranding/rehashing a movie that's been done on multiple occasions the viewer shouldn't expect many fresh ideas. I didn't believe I was going to get any fresh material from this new version of TCSM but was hoping to have some new life breathed into the franchise at least. Sadly not, and this is about as ""paint (in blood) by numbers"" as you'd get. I have this movie 3 stars, simply based on the fact that I wanted the characters to be butchered. Please stop remaking/adding unnecessary sequels to classic horror movies.",2022-02-27

"The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre is credited with beginning the slasher horror film craze, inspiring other titans of the horror genre such as Halloween and Friday the 13th. The original film taps into many aspects of subconscious, fight-to-survive horror. I had never seen the original until I prepared to watch the new film. While the original had various reasons for its fame, this new film absolutely obliterated any chance of a revival for this horror franchise.A sad, cash-grab attempt at copying the newer Halloween franchise, which sports its own host of issues, the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre is so poorly brought together, it's a miracle it can be called a movie. Don't waste your time like I did, take my word of warning and avoid Netflix's half-assed attempt to reinvigorate a classic horror franchise at all costs.What were your thoughts on these films?",2023-07-07
"People writing bad reviews must want some type of magical miracle horror film that could never be made. It's about a creeper with a chainsaw, there are limits. This was creepy, brutal, shocking, interesting, well acted, and in a story reflective of current times. Good job creators! I guess it wasn't particularly ""scary"", though. I think that may be it's real flaw in my opinion. The suspense wasn't built up enough in the scenes to give me time to actually be as scared as I would have liked. That being said, It was definitely gruesome enough and looked great. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would gladly watch more from this crew in the future.",2022-02-19

"***spoiler alert***
Wow. I knew this was going to be bad as soon as the not-so-suddle Tesla advertisements began. ""Auto-drive On!"" Yep, get ready for a droll slow paced death trek through the decrepit town of Harlow, witnessing the dumber-than-dumb victims getting mauled, strangled and chopped up by the smartest person in the movie ""Leather Face"" because he always knows just what weapon to use at just the right time? It bothers me that they make the villain seem like a dumb mute idiot and he ends up being the only one with any intelligence. You can almost read the character's minds with the blatant cinematic queues:Texan Guy: oh I just had my leg bashed in, let me try to push this guy out of a batter window. Derrrr!Leatherface: what that there? Oh. Piece glass? Yay! I like glass it kill good.The scriptwriters here were clearly making some sort of commentary on social media and those that use it mid-film as well but don't they realize that this movie needs all the help it can get?!Lastly among all the asinine people in this film, the least-to-suck award should have gone to the vengeance seeking heroine from the first movie. Well whattaya know... she's a freaking moron! Riddle me this: you return to face the guy who killed your friends. Why the heck would you bring just a rifle? Wouldn't you want to show up with some additional weapons, grenades, a bazooka maybe?Overall this movie wasn't worth the anxiety to watch. Watch the original and maybe some of the predecessors, but avoid this one if you value your time. And if there's ever been a valid reason to get a self driving Tesla it's so it can autopilot you to safety while you scream frantically and watch in sheer terror as a psycho chops up your friend or relative.",2022-10-08

"In this reboot of the weak Leatherface's saga, except for the first movie, we have an also weak development in every sense you can think, in every sector of it.We've got a lot of teenagers that BOUGHT a CITY in the middle of nowhere to create a hippie society there. And don't misunderstand, this could be an interesting subject IF the movie get into these discussion. Which did not happened at all
I personally think that the autor could give his story some profundity, but he preferes to take the protagonists past and throw it in trash, by guiding everything to a nonsense blood storm and, honestly, who cares to that old lady with a giant gun?Any way, what made this movie so dumb was not the fact of no interesting characters to care about, but how the script doesn't do anything more of a unjustified violence for every of the constructions it could have done.4/10 (it has a nice photography)",2022-02-21

The story no problem you wake up 2 people after 50 years of bear hibernation and then a almost 6ft 6inches ( I may be wrong on the height but you you get my point) can jump from one place to another and with speed which is I must phenomenal (sarcastically).Not only that when the legacy victim has the chance to blow leatherheads head off easily she then gets cold feet and lets him to just come back to be killed and thrown into the dumpster. Who the hell writes that kind of stories. I must say the writer should be chain sawed his hands.Not only that the main characters when finally kill the guy he again jumps out of no where after drowning in water and then takes the head off the main character.

"The writing wasn't bad. It was terrible. Some of the logic these characters used. It doesn't seem like a Texas chainsaw movie and at first the characters sucked definitely rooting for leather face in this movie. This movie made leatherface look like the good guy lmao this movie was so trash i wanted leatherface to murder them all. Lol no one talks about the lady that was about to run around leather face in the bus and instead of running out the front door of the bus. She decided to try to jump through a window like a few feet in front of leather face. Climbed so slowly though it and just gets cut in half lol. The characters are so dumb in the film they just wait to be killed, it's like they all picked numbers of who to be killed next. The only thing good about this movie is the way they all meet the chainsaw. The guy is 76 years old and he runs fast with a chainsaw bruh cmon. What a awful script and a waste of time. She could shoot him, what the hell was she waiting for, this old woman? And what are they sitting in the car and looking at them instead of escaping from there with the car? Who writes such scripts? Absolutely terrible! I've never hated characters so much in my life. ""If you run, he'll never stop haunting you,"" Sally says. So. Terrified teenage girl with PTSD (who has had no gun training and doesn't understand how to accurately shoot a shotgun) proceeds to leave her sister bleeding in a car and FOLLOW the deranged psycho with a chainsaw and a mutilated face-mask into the unfamiliar building where any number of traps could be waiting for her and he could be hiding anywhere.

The charters are 1 dimension & boring.The death scenes were ace as with the bus scene which was epic as. The ending while cringy was surprising & not too bad. The length at 1 hour & 14 minutes was good with alright pacing.Overall, it's a bland film story wise & character wise. The gory was insane & epic & there was plenty of good scenes to see, but it's pretty much the same as the other installments but more gorier.5/10.",2022-03-17
"Well yesterday we watched the brand new Texas chainsaw on Netflix platform. I must say as a fan of many villains and one of them is Leatherface I was pretty disappointed with this franchise.First of all,the massacre starts really fast.Not a single reference how the serial killer got there,what happened to the old house of the Sawyer family and generally lack of background story.Secondly,the scenario is also pretty poor and the actors are above average.The only good thing is that Leatherface was as we knew him from previous movies(except Leatherface movie),tall,giantish body man.Generally not a good effort from Netflix,didn't meet our expectations.",2022-02-20
"""Are you okay? No"". Makes sense. You've just been hounded by a dude with a contorted mask, a quick first step, and a chainsaw. Said dude has killed just about everybody and you're about the only one left. Yeesh.Anywho, 2022's Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a sequel to 1974's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. ""Massacre"" doesn't feel like it's part of the 9-flick franchise. I'm not saying it's awful but who thought it was a fresh idea to make this new installment a Michael Myers movie with social media quirks and a little bit of House of Wax thrown in. I mean is Netflix that hard up to reinvent (or change) the wheel?Reboots and follow-ups begot, Texas Chainsaw Massacre has few main characters in it and they are barely established. All we know is that they're just four people who happen to want to fix up some property in Harlow, Texas (the spot where the killings took place in the original from 48 years ago). You have the token African American, the token hottie damsel in distress, and two sisters (one of which looks like a young Winona Ryder). These people aren't bad actors but their personalities are meh. They are the equivalent of petrified rocks.""Massacre"" is what you expect. It's bloody, overkill-ed, and well, horrific. Is it scary? Kind of towards the last half hour (that's when Leatherface finally yields his tool). Is it well-directed by the unseasoned David Blue Garcia? To a point. Except for some familiar tracking shots by cinematographer Ricardo Diaz, Texas Chainsaw Massacre has very little connection to what made '74's version so effectively limited and so psychologically disturbing.""Massacre"" is not a horror film per se, it's more of a slasher pic (there is a difference). There's no torture or will holding, just kills (and lots of them). Added to that, there's too many people around and it doesn't feel like the victims are in the middle of nowhere. That's not as foreboding. A modern-day take (such as this one) on the Texas Chainsaw fondue might give fright fans their cinematic, heroin fix. Not me mind you. I'm just a purist who's still stuck in the glorious graininess of 1974 (so sue me).",2022-03-02

Unfortunately, this was not the case and it was more of a Gen Z induced nightmare. I mean I'm Gen Z myself... but I wouldn't want to be identified with these insufferable morons that can't even called characters. TCM is one of my favorite all time horror franchises and I gotta say even the least popular entry Texas Chainsaw 3D delivered. But boy oh boy this one was a real treat.

"Very silly as it went on but some of the imagery was pretty good,had some atmosphere.Sure not a patch on the original , or for my money the Jessica Alba Chainsaw movie from a few years back.That said i have seen worse ( Candyman anyone?)
But maybe it is just time to put these franchises to bed now.",2022-02-27
"This sucks highly disappointing!! The original movies will always be so much better than the remakes. I had high hopes for this but it did not meet expectations. All of it is unrealistic, and the end was one of the worst endings in movies. Netflix is disappointing how dare you endorse this.",2022-02-19
"I just don't understand such a low rating ! Everything in this film ,as It should be in another Leatherface installment ! Annoying youngsters , gore and big bad chainsaw ! Absolutely loved It !",2022-03-21
"I gave this film a rating of four for the following reasons (spoilers ahead)The characters: We know barely anything about them except the sister who seems like a background character. They're all incredibly unlikable, however we don't even get a chance to warm up to them.Was that the point?If it was, they kind of missed the mark.Sally: Bringing back one of the most famous Final Girls in the horror genre. A classic character who quite literally does nothing of substance aside from providing a gun.For what?THAT'S how you're gonna do it?What was the point?Did I miss it?Am I the dumb one?Hello?The characters (Again): I don't think I've instantly said out loud ""ugh, hope you're out"" when meeting a group of characters. Honestly, my mind was just like ""no.. come on.""The Bus Scene: ok this scene was actually great - one note but still great. It stays one note and doesn't escalate so it just seems to drag.It started, we got a whiff of these characters, old mate comes back and ends up literally in the bin, the characters are very unlikeable, people died, chainsaws were chainsaweed and then boom it ends.The final scene: First of all, yes - I feel that this character definitely deserved it HOWEVER the entire bit with the car and the slow driving and the screaming I actually thought this was the stupidest way to end it.At the same time I'm a little fried, hungry, I'm no professional reviewer just my lil ol' thoughts.",2022-02-18
"It's a good slasher movie, but the characters were extremely unlikeable. They were a bunch of woke , entitled young people who seemed to feel they had the right to say anything they wanted to anyone and act as though they were superior to anyone they came across in this town. I found myself actually rooting for Leatherface to take them all down. I didnt want any of them to survive.",2022-02-20
"As much as it seems to be a sequel to the Tobe Hooper film, it is a different film with a different atmosphere. It's a decent movie that offers good deaths and enough gore that restores some dignity to the saga. The curious thing about this film is its Leatherface, which no matter how much it is insisted that it is the one from the original film, in reality it is not. The Leatherface in this film is clearly a relative of the original Leatherface, since here we have a young man and also the events of the first film seem to have been forgotten. Apart from that, another of its weaknesses is that it does have some somewhat absurd moments. Also, the concept of this saga is already somewhat rusty for modern times. This ninth installment in the franchise is entertaining and enjoyable, but it obviously falls short of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. My final rating for this film is 7/10.",2023-03-26
What were they thinking killing off the blonde first and then the black guy. Everyone knows the black guy is first and the blonde makes it in the end. The setting isn't a house out in the middle of nowhere when it easily could have been. All the blonde needed to do was get the sheriffs gun and kill the bad guy in the first scene. The end right?! The movie overall is sort of ok though. The original 1974 movie is the worst piece of trash ever made. It's laughable how bad that movie is. This movie is far better than the original.,2022-03-27
"The reluctant ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" franchise gets yet another reboot/reimagining/sequel, but this time they go the Halloween/Kills/Ends route and bring back a surviving character from the original film. Things don't work out as well here as they did for the ""Halloween"" series. Four idealistic (or naive?) friends purchase a ghost town in Texas. They plan on renovating the entire town, and turning it into a progressive haven where they can save the world. Sisters Melody (Sarah Yarkin) and Lila (Elsie Fisher), and couple Dante (Jacob Latimore) and Ruth (Nell Hudson) have run-ins with local law enforcement and some town hangers-on, with the film makers casting aspersions immediately- the Gen Z/millenials are portrayed as wide-eyed and woke, while the Texans encountered are a bunch of drawling, gun-toting racists. Lila was injured in a school shooting, and Melody hovers over her constantly. The group hear the tale of Leatherface (told in the 1974 original film), and we learn that the final surviving girl from that film, Sally (Olwen Fouere, taking the role originated by the late Marilyn Burns), became a Texas Ranger and is currently waiting for the call that her archnemesis may still be found since the murders of her friends are officially listed as ""unsolved."" The group arrives in the ghost town to wait for a busload of investors, and find that an old lady (Alice Krige) and her adopted son (Mark Burnham) are still living in an abandoned orphanage. The ghost town is going to get renovated by one man, Richter (Moe Dunford), who doesn't take to the group. Leatherface finally makes a questionable appearance, there's a lot of questions throughout, and the carnage begins.The timeline for the TCM franchise is even more convoluted than the Halloween franchise. The film is barely over eighty minutes long, so there isn't a lot of character development or legacy building, although I did see director Garcia paying tribute to some other famous slasher films here and there. The script tries to inject something different into its story, addressing the influencer craze without going overboard with it. Garcia's direction works well with the film's editing, and this is a tightly shot flick, although Bulgaria makes a lousy substitute for the Lone Star state- I'm a fourth generation born Texan, and know my birth state pretty well.The problem here is, of course, the script. Characters not only make bad decisions, they make idiotic decisions that literally get themselves and others killed. While some of them evolve and put up a fight against Leatherface, they also open themselves up to their own demise because if they didn't, the movie would be even shorter. The gore and violence is over the top, and I was very surprised that it got an (R) rating. The special effects are very well done, but also very convincing, to the point that this isn't a ""fun"" horror film. ""Terrifier"" was also a gory slasher/horror film, but it had tension and suspense. ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" has little tension, and viewers asking aloud ""why did they just do that?!"" instead. One set-piece on a bus was probably set up as the be-all end-all of gruesome mass murder, but it becomes a nihilistic exercise in tedium. In this day and age, it's sad that we've become so numb, this is considered entertainment to be ""enjoyed"" again and again, considering that the original film, aside from one of the greatest titles of all-time, wasn't as gory as you would expect. I think it's okay to finally put this franchise to rest, it debuted on streaming because of some disastrous pre-release screenings, so don't look for it on physical media anytime soon. I didn't hate it as much as some viewers and critics did- I guess I'm old school, looking for the horror in my horror films.Contains very strong physical violence, strong gun violence, very strong gore, profanity, mild sexual references, very strong adult situations, alcohol use.",2023-10-08
"This movie is only 80 minutes, thank goodness.There is no protagonist.This is BY FAR the worst of the Texas Chainsaws, and one of the worst horrors ever. Give me House of Wax with Paris Hilton, or Wrong Turn 5 any day of the week over this pile of shifting waste.There are no redeeming qualities.There was some potential in the first 25 minutes. You get to liking the characters as they are introduced, but they get dumber and dumber as the sun goes down. They suddenly go from social media celebrities/chefs, and seemingly intelligent, to dumb as a box o' rocks. How do they get so stupid so fast? And the plot had already stagnated by this point.The gore and slashing eventually starts, but the movie gets worse as it goes. It was so bad by 65 minutes in, that I stopped watching, and started writing this review. I had to rewind and watch the last 13 minutes just to see how it ends... There is about a 10 second scene during the credits if you want to fast forward to it, nothing crazy.The gore factor is ok, but it's not very engaging, it's just meh. I was not impressed, there is a lack of ""edge of your seat"" factor. There are no real surprises. It seemed like the director was in a hurry to get this film onto Netflix. This is a straight to video movie. Please tell me this was not in theaters.Acting: 5 stars

"After Texas Chainsaw 3D and Leatherface, this franchise had no where to go, but up. So, I'll start off with that.I genuinely thoroughly enjoyed the film. It was fun, & refreshing after the last two installments. It's a fun, crazy, and gory ride! With some scenes feeling very dragged out, causing the pacing of the film to feel very slow at times. (I skipped maybe 10-30 seconds throughout two scenes, just based on how dragged out it was).The last 30 seconds though, made me just not like the film, but that's just my opinion (i feel like it'll be an unpopular one, but i stand by it). I could've just done without that ending, but still keeping the post credit scene. Just (and i can not emphasize this enough) the last 30 seconds that got me feeling, MEH.I think moving this film to stream on Netflix and NOT theatrical release was the SMART move.",2022-02-18
Lots of blood and fast paced and quite scary to. Totally enjoyed the movie.Don't go for negative reviews. Atleast watch for 20 minutes and then decide.,2022-02-20
"The film isn't a perfect satisfying sequel as halloween (I am not comparing it to halloween).okay let's go first with some good points .1. Kills ( totally effective the fx team worked really good for the kills bus scene was epic).2. Cinematography was awesome but not to the point of original writing.3.some chilling moment i can't tell them.4. Leatherface he was phenomenal the horror the look the costume department really did a good job and the actor who played him was also good.5. It also tells about how he gets its mask for the whole movie not like the original which didn't tell us how he got the mask.Now to the negative points
1. The writing was bland.2. Characters were annoying.3. Dumb Characters.4. Adding lame humour
5. The ending was a bit taken from original to give it a tribute but honestly if they did something original of their own it would be really better.6. Sally's character was totally destroyed with really bad writing.So the film is only a one time watch for its fans but not for new audience.",2022-02-18

"So much blood and gore, but I guess that's true to the franchise. I was actually rooting for Leatherface to kill all these yuppies who thought it would be a great idea to gentrify an old abandoned Texas strip. The scene in the bus, laughable. In the league of slow moviegoing killers, he's no Michael Myers.",2022-07-24
"What a groaner. It starts out promising but you'll quickly realize what you're in for: A tonal nightmare that will leave you scratching your head.Sarah Yarkin is a horrible actress in this movie, which is unfortunate because she gets tons of screen time, probably more than anyone else. I was so sick of seeing her and hearing her. And *of course* she's made to be a hero character. I was literally laughing out loud at this below-feature-length-running-time film, what a nightmare. You'll see 95% of the 'scares' coming a mile away. I found myself thinking ""Surely they won't do this old cliché, right?"" and then it happens. Also bringing back Sally from the first film only to make her into a very shallow clone of Laurie Strode trying to kill Michael Myers and then killing her off in a very stupid way had me wondering why and how they needed multiple writers for this junk heap.Leatherface is turned into a mindless evil killing machine which goes against the original movie, which would be fine if they weren't constantly referencing the original movie. He also doesn't make pig noises which removes a lot out of the feel of the character. He's pretty dehumanized and just turned into your run of the mill movie monster. You don't feel bad for him, he's just an immortal tank who gets shot multiple times and is completely fine.Some positives: The gore is above average I'd say. I had one genuine laugh WITH the movie instead of the many laughs I had that were AT the movie. Good performance by Elsie Fisher, especially given the rest of the movie.If this is what a 20 million dollar movie looks like then I have no hope for the future. It feels like money laundering.",2022-03-18
"This is the worst sequel of TCM franchise (I haven't watched TCM:The next generation).And it is a pity, because this movie was pretty interesting and good until the last 20 minutes. I intended to recommend it, but these 20 minutes approximately were awful, almost like a parody of the movie before.Characters do irrational things that make the viewer angry and frustrated.This is a movie about a killer that wears leather in his face, but still, there's got to be some common logic in characters' moves.This old -survivor- lady should not be a part of it, i mean as a character.Still, there are some things to enjoy here, there is violence, nice cinematography, some really dark comedy, good acting but, regarding the actors, this was not a good casting.They look like kids, come on! When you antagonize Leatherface, you should not look like a 12 years old kid. Ending was laughable for this reason, among others.Good actors but not for a TCM movie.In conclusion, it is kinda enjoyable but TCM franchise includes better movies. Even LEATHERFACE (2017) is better.",2022-06-26

"Trying to appeal to a younger audience and hitting every cringey cliché in the book. It's bad, very bad. The story isn't really a story, half the cast can't act and every plot decision felt like it came from a Reddit pole. It feels like an old person trying to write young people but at the same time feels like an 12 year old wrote the script. It would have been quite enjoyable if the main characters weren't so hateable and boring. I was routing for leatherface the entire time. On a positive note, the cgi looks pretty amazing at times.",2022-03-13
"This movie is to the edge to become funny... i hate it at horror movies...and let's be honest, the storyline is silly but i 'm gonna rate it higher than i should to, due to the brutal death scenes and the old fashioned (almost retro) style.

The gore is very important at this kind of movies and this literally entertained me without get bored! I guess that was the purpose!",2022-08-11
"...what do you expect. It is what it is supposed to be, and that is a gore fest (though it probably could have gone further). And a plus is that all of the characters are so annoying, you don't care what happens to them.

Goodness, I even feel bad for fans of Texans, fans of chainsaws, and fans of massacres! Booooooo!!!",2022-07-15
"Another movie that netfix screwed up. In the 2022 movie, we see that leatherface actually does useful work for the society. It would have been much better if he had brought the netflix team together while it was touching.If you've watched the movie, you'll know. There is a family that is actually a human butcher. He is the mentally retarded ugly child of the family. Over time, they make this kid go crazy and cut everyone alive. The director called the first Rob Zombie had disgraced the movie. Then Hollywood recovered a bit. But netflix made her mother cry again.A group of three people bought the entire desert town. They will develop projects on it and sell it to the rich. But those in a house still haven't vacated the house. The employee says, ""Didn't you receive a subpoena, Ms. Mom, she's going to leave the house. Auntie goes crazy and throws herself because you don't act. The police van is coming soon. Police; ee who is the companion of this, say leatherface; I'll be my teacher, he says. A woman dies on the way. Leather goes crazy too. Then he sees that their regiment is stupid. He says, ""Did we count money for the seed of Ian?"" and tries all of them. The blonde would survive if she pretended to be dead for the first time, then the property that stopped the bus suddenly and got off, then the stupid aunt who came after waiting for 50 years and didn't shoot her when she had the chance to not remember her, a busload of rich suckers and the lead girls. They are indeed harmful to society. What kind of leather does leatherface have, friend, it's like bulletproof armor. Does not die stubbornly. The car that went at 5 km per hour at the last hour was also good.There is no nude scene in the movie (amazing for netflix) but there is a lot of brutality. I'll say it's fun, but it's ridiculous bro.",2022-02-27
"What I really want to see is a horror film where not every character makes terrible decisions, that don't make sense and quickly lead to their death.Very gory but, predictable!",2022-02-20
"The Good: Look, I'm not the biggest TCM fan. I've always found the hillbilly cannibal stuff both mean-spirited and really difficult to watch. While I can appreciate Leatherface and the franchise's impact on horror, I don't even think TCM fans like many of the movies.Perhaps that's why I didn't mind this 2022 that much. I liked that they simplified Leatherface's origin story and would have much preferred they went hard reboot than attempt to connect the original film with this one (in a very lazy, nonsensical way, I might add). I liked that his mask looked more like the original film and I found him to be a genuinely terrifying presence. There are also some really great kills in this; the entire sequence in the bus is honestly fantastic and will satisfy any gore-hound.I also liked how this film wove social commentary and political issues into the narrative. It didn't feel forced or unnecessary; Lila, played by Elsie Fisher, is a survivor of a school shoting. Melody, her sister, is an idealistic young liberal who wants to start a new community in the Texas hinterland. There's discussion of gun culture, Confederate symbols, gentrification, stereotyping...yet they felt natural and purposeful to me. I don't get people who hate ALL POLITICS in film (often, these sort of people just don't want to see their views challenged unexpectedly while watching I movie, just my two cents) and there's certainly a bad way to do it, but...don't we want films of today to reflect, you know, TODAY? This movie handled these topics about as well as they could've, with surprising nuance and empathy for people on all sides.I also felt the actors and their characters were pretty good too! Elsie Fisher and Sarah Yankin have great chemistry and I could totally buy their relationship. Most of the people here are pretty good. I don't know man, to me this is easily the best TCM movie I've seen in decades at this point.The Bad: Okay, anyone who's seen enough slasher films recognizes that there's a bit of suspension of disbelief involved. Characters will make unbelievably bad and stupid decisions, the killer can teleport to wherever he's needed, physics and human anatomy are questionable. That sort of stuff.But this movie does have so jaw dropping and frankly, baffling decisions made by characters that just go beyond the human drive for survival. There are WAY too many moments when characters seemingly accept they will be slaughtered and no one thinks of simple solutions (like, I don't know, bum rushing Leatherface while he's trapped in a confined space too?) The final sequence is ABSURD. The fact that these two tiny girls even want to defeat this clearly gigantic and extremely dangerous man is incredulous, but the way they go about it...yeah both of them should have been dead several times over.The movie is also a bit short and sort of jumps right into the carnage without that necessary build up. I wish some of the characters were fleshed out more and I can see people missing a bit of that suspense.The Ugly: According to this film's confusing timeline, Leatherface would be at least 73 years old at this point. I'd say just ignore that and sit back, grab some popcorn, and enjoy a bunch of Degrassi kids on a field trip to rural Texas. That's essentially what this is.",2022-04-03
"Nice work that this new chapter in the ""chainsaw massacre"" franchise. This one is a direct sequel to Tobe Hooper's film. Leatherface is now several decades older. That is to say that he has less energy, he tires faster, but he gets his chainsaw to let know connected to Youtube, may be influencers or influencers, he is not happy because his mother of adoption is dead. It will follow a massacre, with especially the point of view of two sisters that we follow until the end.The setting is a ghost town, but it still has some real inhabitants. The film spares no effort to build suspense and plays with the viewer. Then there are explosions of violence, with a lot of blood, to annoy these people who want to settle in the ghost town. The film invites characters from Tobe Hooper's film, and makes the explicit link with it. The film injects elements of gore of course, in an ensemble that holds up and doesn't lie about its title.The move to the city, instead of the countryside and an isolated house, brings a certain freshness to the franchise and allows a renewal. While remaining in the chromos of the franchise.",2022-03-24

"This movie is a mess. A really big mess. This review won't be even half as long as my average review, and that's because I really don't want to have to write about this movie for longer than five minutes. Well, I guess I should start off with the ""plot"". Ugh..The storyline for this movie is that a group of influencers travel to an abandoned town in Texas with the hopes of turning it into a town for influencers, but uh oh! Leatherface lives in the town. The entire plot sucks. Why did the main characters have to be the worst main characters ever? Why did they have to be influencers? Why did they make this movie? So many questions yet none will be answered. Ok, jokes aside the storyline in this is about as good as the story in Terrifier (2016) and that had no story. What's up with that weird scene with Leatherface's ""caretaker"" saying a racial slur? I don't understand the point of that scene. I don't understand why a group of influencers would even do something like this in the first place. Aside from the basic set-up the story is basically non-existent. It just creates situations for Leatherface to kill people. There is no twist or fun aspect to create this more interesting or anything. I'm done talking about the story. I'll talk about the characters now.The characters are trash. I've already said that, but I'm going to say it again. They suck. Each one is selfish and annoying. The only 2 semi-likeable characters are the one normal dude still living in the town, and Lila. Other than that, they all suck. Especially Melody and Dante. Leatherface isn't scary or unsettling anymore. I guess some characters have ""character arcs"" but it's hard to care when I barely liked them in the first place. The movie very quickly turns into ""I wonder who Leatherface is going to kill next?"" It loses what made the original so disturbing and uncomfortable. It can't even be like the 2003 remake because this movie sucks as a slasher. There is no tension AT ALL. I was never stressed or worried in any scene. All of the characters make the dumbest decisions possible, and you just start to want Leatherface to kill them. But I think the WORST thing this movie does was bring back Sally. Why'd they bring her back? But they couldn't even make her return done right! It takes nearly the entire movie for her to return just for the biggest injustice to any character I've seen in a movie to be done.This movie is horrible, and is a massive F you to fans of the series. Netflix was quite possibly the worst possible streaming service this could've been produced by and it hurts. Let this series die. Please. (Also contrary to what I said at the start, this review was not shorter than my average review.)",2022-10-17
"Of the modern films based on classic slashers, whether it be a reboot, a sequel, or a modernized version, this comes in last. If you want Rob Zombie style gore, you're on the right path, but that's all this movie offers. If you want a poor carbon copy of Halloween (2018), this is it. Other than the character of Leathrface, I would rank this movie, as a whole, worse than A Nightmare on Elmstreet (2010); even an identical remake, like the afformentioned film, would have been better. But hey, at least Leatherface took the time to do his signature dance at the end.",2022-02-19
"Standard by the books sequel, reboot nonsense. This movie is terrible, but it's not that terrible as it has ""some"" moments of enjoyment, for instance the massacre of the bus while it's live-streamed was enjoyable; and when the girl got knocked down the stairs was so bad it made me laugh out loud. However rest is just garbage. The set looks like it thrown together in about 2 hours on a really, really cheap sound stage. They brought back a character from the original movie simply to cash in on the recent Jamie Lee Curtis Halloween return, however it was absolute pointless to do that, we had it just a Sarah Connor type character. They introduced a survivor from a school shooting to make her a ""real"" survivor. That was really bad taste and the writers clearly should have known better.Best to simply avoid and watch the original. Heck even watch the 2003 remake as it's better than this.",2023-09-10
"Most modern horror films are much the same: get a bunch of totally repellent characters together, make most of the audience hate them immediately, and start killing them off.

Film said maniac with their smartphones, naturally, and threaten him with being cancelled. At this point I literally burst out laughing. And the subsequent butchery fest was everything I'd hoped for.

"Ugh hate the slow intro... The lines are oke but not great ... actions are so classic. Special effects are done Ok but below the average quality.Ugh hate it when everything is plunged all in one scene, too much action and after it is slowed down.Some camera usage they did a good job but overall it is Ok sometimes even below. Maybe because it is too obvious actions making the camera work just average pushing not much.Way too easy made, actions are way too predictable. Also pity everything is very fine chewed, way too easily for the audience to follow. They could easily done a better job by just hide it or slowly reveal it. Much is obvious and way too classic like lighting and sound.There are some nice scenery effects that are done nicely

The characters were all just your typical slasher victim kind of people. The story in my opinion was crap because everyone who dies in awesome ways, dies being surprisingly dumb.

When you are attacked by a gruesome killer with a chainsaw, of course the feeling of fear bring down your reflexes and your rational thinking and the stupid decisions are inevitable! 8/10 stars from me! Give it a chance, it deliverers what a true horror fan want: bloody kills, fear, suspans and gritty atmosphere!",2022-03-01
Easily the best sequel in a long series of mostly duds and lackluster efforts.There was more to these characters than the typical paper thin nonsense seen in many of these movies. I actually felt like I was rooting them to survive. There were a number of surprising and shocking deaths. Omg... this film is like a love letter to violence. Definitely beware. The suspense and pacing are perfect. It really kept me on the edge of my seat!My only criticism is the last 10 or 15 mins that get stupid. Impossible things happen. It's always annoying when they bend the rules of physics. But I had enjoyed it up until the end so I won't be too upset about it. Def worth a watch!,2022-02-26
"I really don't agree this under 5 medium rate.The plot is as simple as it has always be.It is so easy to make a crític.It is so simple to argue the work of anyone.Bravo,
to take something old,
Respect It,
And make something fresh and new!",2022-02-27

Director: David Blue Garcia.Starring: Sarah Yarkin, Elsie Fisher, Mark Burnham, Jacob Latimore, Moe Dunford, Olwen Fouere, Jessica Allain, Nell Hudson, Alice Krige, etc.After nearly 50 years of hiding, Leatherface returns to terrorize a group of idealistic young friends who accidentally disrupt his carefully shielded world in a remote Texas town. I personally had an absolute blast with this movie.The cinematography was great, with the documentary style of filmmaking that the franchise is known for returning for a few scenes which was great. The nostalgia was great and perfect for the recent hype around nostalgia in films. The linked plot points between the different characters were well done. With some great set design, and fantastic character design for Leatherface. Plus the set up for Leatherface returning was great. With a great uncomfortable and intense tone throughout. The jumpscares were great. The gore and the kills were absolutely brutal and creative, it made my stomach turn in parts especially with the bus scene which was amazing. The leads of Sarah Yarkin and Elsie Fisher were likeable and their performances were good. The score was great, with a good enough character motivation for Leatherface. Plus, the final act was intense, thrilling and shocking.However, there was obviously a lot of problems with it. A lot of the characters were unlikeable, the set up of why the characters were going to the town was underdeveloped. There was a distinct lack of plot, the script was very bad for most of the film. Plus the plot element of bringing back Olwen Fouere as Sally was unnecessary and copied Halloween, plus what happened to her character made her appearance in the film pointless.Overall, is Texas Chainsaw Massacre a well put together movie? Not necessarily. But this film isn't about loads of plot, great character work or a great script. But it has inventive and incredibly gory kills, with Leatherface in his full glory. With a gripping intensity from start to finish that will keep you hooked.Overall Score 72/100.",2022-03-08
0 stars should really be an option at this point. This movie is atrocious. The characters are awful and very hate-able. The best part is where grandma-leather face chainsaws almost everyone to death on the bus.,2022-02-20
"I thought they stopped making movies like this? The ""Don't Go In There"" plot. It's a good enough remake, with brilliant effects, surprisingly lacking Chainsaws!! (It turns up near the end, in fact the Bus scene is brilliant!!) You can however predict every jumpy moment and also unfortunately the ending.",2022-02-27
"Lots of spoilers.The idea of this movie is intended to be an update or more aptly put a soulless cash grab.How amazing though? A horror movie in 2022 and the gore is not impressive, and the ""character"" development is limited to zero. The addition of the woke agenda is alive and well
In this ""film"". I can appreciate two things from
This movie. The run time is limited so it won't waste that much or your time. The second is that none of the main characters are likable so You won't feel bad when they eventually die. Ideally when all of us have seen a horror movie we want the protagonists to live, but this isn't this kind of horror movie.One very important note, and that is that no one would allow their fiancé to go to the hospital with police because some random old lady had a heart attack. The fiancé going with the police to the hospital wasn't going to fix anything. Also if after witnessing the first 3 minutes of the film you already know that the male protagonist was going to die.I highly recommend watching the original if you want to really see how suspense is built and even though horror movies aren't know for character development.... That movie at least convinces us to care about the protagonists.It is a shame that in 2022 horror movies cannot establish that. The female influencer also hides underneath the bed instead of helping a local resident because reasons.This movie is filled with so many awful things and I was hoping that there would
Be something redeeming about it but unfortunately it doesn't live up to
The hype.",2022-03-13
"Maybe I had high expectations.I think it could have been a bit longer and given Sally more screen time, she got like 5 minutes and was killed after waiting 50 years.Other than that it was not bad.",2022-02-19
"What a load of garbage. What is Netflix doing? Why is everything they put out now part of the Woke generation? This movie is full of the usual stereotypical characters and anti-everything that might offend. I'm cancelling my Netflix, this was the last straw.",2022-05-17
"I watched this movie with my friend and honestly I was so mad at every decision made in this film and stressful it was to watch how every character acted in that situation, like it was all convenient. The only good thing I found was the fast pacing of the film and maybe the cool references to the Shining.Would recommend if all you wanna watch are gory deaths as a slash fan but other than that I think you can save your time.",2022-02-19
"Its all just blood and gore, which isnt a bad thing but, the characters are fricking annoying, I wanted to see all of them killed, and it actually pays off a little but still. Its just boring and whats up with Leatherface, he was supposed to be a normal human with mental problems, besides being big, he is just a regular guy and in this movie he stands infinite shotgungs as if he was Jason, what the hell. The only scene I liked was Leatherface killing all those people on the bus, it is brutal, and is the only scene worth watching for.",2022-03-02
"Very very predictable. The ""scares"" were just not scary. The action scenes were just boring and it appeared no one had a brain when dealing with Leatherface. There were scenes where people were literally lifted up by having a chain saw inside of them and still able to talk afterwards or in some cases shoot Leatherface was just laughable. The scene on the bus when Leatherface got on there was more irritating than scary. The worrying thing is they left it open for a further film which I hope they never make. A Netflix film that didn't need making and time I will never get back watching it. Wouldn't bother watching.",2022-02-18
"I was honestly quite impressed with the cinematography, production, and pacing of the first half, despite the silliness of the plot that was clearly a way of setting up a smorgasbord of fodder for Leatherface. And boy does he take advantage. Though the humanization of the character was palpable and refreshing, that all disintegrates in the second half, where the movie follows every horror trope and then one-ups it with the stupidest decisions, most obvious plot holes and a laughable absence of realism. In the first half however we have your typical local hick who's expected to be one of the antagonists but lo and behold he's actually a great guy. Many of the shots, especially the scene in the sunflower field, were just shy of beautiful in a grisly way. The whole bus scene was both funny in a satirical way, disturbingly gruesome, and yet what preceded it made absolutely zero sense.",2022-03-11
"Every move in this movie is dumb, not to mention the decisions. The murders are not sympathetic, the scene on the bus - please gouge out my eyes. The murder of a maniac is a cartoon.And are you serious? The maniac recently killed a lot of people, and your best friends, and you laughing and joking at the end of the film? Terrible sequel, but don't worry, there are a few more films to come.The only thing that deserves a rating of 4 is the quality of the picture.",2022-02-22
"Ever want to see a mixture of the left wing agenda in a classic horror movie? No? Neither did anybody else, buy Netflix thought otherwise.A+ for gore and suspense, but everything else was trash. The acting, the stupid cliche decisions, the plot, etc.No need for this sequel.",2022-02-19
"She caused everybody to die by being a coward, how are we supposed to support tvis character?Acting good.Characters poor.Story same as ever.Let down by storey telling.",2022-02-26
"Plot isn't good. Characters are dumb. Bad guy is over powered. However, I'd say it's a fun watch if you wanna laugh. But overall the storyline is godawful.",2022-03-02
"You don't look like Adrienne Barbeau. Anyways, bad movie but had an actual chainsaw massacre scene, which the predecessors failed to live up to. Skip unless you have absolutely nothing else to do.",2022-02-21
Complete and utter trash. Terribly acting and sally returning after 50 years as a nutcase gun welding cow girl.Complete and utter rubbish and a waste of 1hr 30 minutes. Don't waste your time watching this trash.,2022-03-05
"I actually quite enjoyed this. Yes the actors are not the best, but the drama and horror are fun to watch. Everyone complains about the whole ""wokeness"" about it but that's the world we are living in now. It's a silly movie not meant to be taken seriously. The plot is real thin, the gore is more extreme than some other TCM entries. The bus scene is downright one of the best moments of the film. And the mechanic guy surely deserves a pat on the back for really trying to finally kill Leatherface (and let's face it, the mechanic was the only person we were rooting for). That ending was actually really good, made me do a double take. I would definitely recommend, it's a fun and goofy movie. It ranks in the middle of the TCM franchise. I'll be watching again come Halloween season. And the poster for the movie is amazing, Leatherface in a field of flowers is so magestic.",2022-02-22
"I was excited for new Texas chainsaw movie and bringing Sally back, who they killed with her only having like 5 minutes of screen time. And then killed the final girl at the end.. The whole movie wasn't that even good. I don't recommend it if you feel like having 2 hours of your life not wasted.",2022-02-19
"This is more of a black comedy than horror,it isn't scary,it doesn't have any supspense and even the gore scenes are weak. Comparing this to another ""continuation after years"" slasher, Halloween(2018) is like comparing a 10 hrs flight in economy class surrounded by crying babies and smelly people to a flight in your own luxurious plane. Sure,either isn't a masterpiece but Halloween i can at least reccomend to most of the people while TCM only to a die hard hardcore fans of slashers.",2022-08-05
It is assumed that after untold number of Chainsaw Massacre movies that if you are watching this movie you enjoy the gore - it would have been nice to have a story though and something new to set it apart from the other movies - I was hoping for something better and didn't get it - The acting actually wasn't bad - they just didn't have anything to work with.,2022-02-20
"Pointless, self indulging, waste of time. The only thing saving this from being the absolute worst Texas Chainsaw Massacre is TCM 3. Honestly it's starts pretty bad, and just gets worse.",2022-02-19
"I thoroughly enjoyed the new TCM. It was a simple enough story: kids come to town, mess with Leatherface's mom, and suffer the consequences. It was gory, it was entertaining and thats all I ask of a Texas Chainsaw flick. Will prob watch again.",2022-02-20
I am not against murder porn as a genre when it is written well. I like the Saw series because despite the intricate ways the show like to murder people it tells a particular story. Texas Chainsaw Massacre has never really done that. It just has a bunch of unlikeable people walk into a situation and annoy an unkillable silent and scary looking chainsaw weilding serial killer to the point where he kills them off in increasinly blooding ways. Of course one of them survives. Honestly I would have ranked it a point higher but I really hated the last two minutes.,2022-02-21
"5/10 the ending was good, the killings were good, but it would have been nice to see character development. It's fast paced thrills it is worth one watch atleast. I definitely only need to see it once not worth a second watch. But it did past the time.",2022-02-28
"I can't understand most of the bad reviews this film gets. The killcount is pretty high. The kills themselves are well shot, very diverse, original, bloody and pure gore! Sure, the writing could have been a bit better storywise, but that's acceptable compared to the action this film delivers. Overall, Me and my girlfriend had a fun time watching this movie and isn't that what these kind of films are there for after all?",2022-02-22
It was fine. Very quick pace. Some fun parts. It entertained us. Not really many scares. We watched it. It's fine! Nothing wrong with it. Nothing to rave about. Normal and fine. Entertaining.,2022-02-27
"I would have loved to see something that at least irons out the usual tropes. But I went into this expecting the usual BS that every slasher has.-Characters with 0 survivor instinct.-Leather face is sonic with the dead silence perk on.-Questionable injuries that matter in one scene and doesn't in the next.I was laughing at our lead when she went to chase down a serial killer with super powers without any gun experience whatsoever.Only thing I loved about this movie is that it wasn't bloated and it was straight to the point. Short and sweet.If you are looking for a movie to watch but you don't really want to pay attention, then this is for you. I would honestly treat this as a comedy.",2022-02-18
This is a tale of love and redemption. The hero loses his caretaker to the evils of gentrification. The self righteous millinials have the nerve to think they can buy a town and there would be no consequences. They were dead wrong. 💀 This is a must see for everyone. The writing was spot on and it really has you happy to be alive. 10 🌟,2022-02-20
I liked the 1st hour actually because the clash between left-wing liberal teens and Texas rednecks are pretty entertaining. However it went down from there. A lot of blood and gore for sure but the teens are so unbelievably stupid so I found myself being on Leatherface's side. Even the adults did absolute everything wrong to a point I felt the deserved what was coming.,2022-03-29
"I just feel like the people who made this film had no passion for this film or horror in general.TCM films should get under your skin, make you feel dirty like you are watching something you should never have seen. This just tried to shock with poor gore, zero suspense and HORRENDOUS acting and dialogue. There was a couple of OK bits, sort of. I liked the end anyway. We all need to pretend this never happened and start a fresh with a new filmmaking team.",2022-02-26
"As a fan of the original and the early 2000s remake, I wanted to like this film. Unfortunately, I left feeling offended by how bad this is.They totally missed the mark on everything that made Leatherface such an interesting character. He has no soul in this, just a guy on a murder spree. The subtle art he held in previous iterations was nowhere to be seen.Every scene was predictable, to the point where it feels like it comes from a Hollywood rulebook on how to write cliche horrors.Not one to let this bother me too much but the forced gender politics is quite apparent with fierce imagery that screams ""women are power"" (which they sure are, but they shouldn't be when they're up against a legendary antagonist.) The fact that what they were going for was so obvious just made it more frustrating.",2022-02-19
"Sure, the special effects, acting, sound and video were good but the who premise of the movie was tame. They upped the body count and the gore but that doesn't make a horror movie.They couldn't help but add a little social wokeness and slamming capitalism and other things such as being afraid of the cops. I thought it was funny they basically slammed capitalism but the whole reason they were there was based on capitalism.Probably the most fitting moment was when leatherface approached a bunch of the young business owners and they all held up their camera and dared him to do anything. Boy were they shocked to see a camera did not stop someone bent on destruction.Overall, not the worst TCM but not near the best either. It is in the middle. Perhaps they need to see if they can get the original writers and director (if they are still alive) and have them help.",2022-02-25
"I know horror movie characters are not the brightest, but boy the ones in this movie are actually brain dead! I understand they need to be dumb to a certain plot to keep the movie rolling but they just went overboard with this ones LOL.",2022-02-18
"This ""requel"" does not explore enough of the mini town that this movie takes place in. A proper backstory on leather face and the orphanage would have been more fitting rather than just a ripped image of him. It's really weird how the original house suddenly had a whole town built around it. We don't even figure out what happened to the hitchhiker or the original gas station owner. Instead the have leather faces mother and that's about it. The entire town of Harlow just feels out of place especially when the entire film is just a straight sequel to the original film.The entire cast is woke. A lot of the lines stated throughout the film is woke. Everyone in this movie is just unlikeable. Especially Dante who just is a straight up jerk. Everyone felt like they deserved to die, which is really a bad sign in a horror movie. Melody's death, which was the only real shocking moment in the film. Felt of little deserved when the main characters put in low effort to defeat leatherface.Sally hardesty is a wasted returning protagonist who feels like she has no plan at all when facing leatherface. The movie kinda treats her like a Laurie strode. And tries to pottage Sally as a tough armed woman facing trauma. Which fails when you see that she had no plan and absolutely got destroyed by leatherface.",2022-11-01
But jeez can we stop making these movies now its the same premise over and over and over again. Im surpised they didnt make him go to space yet. Yes this was the most brutal and gore filled. But it was a trash script trash acting. I cant believe fede was even part of this. Lame movie.,2022-02-25
This isn't the Texas Chainsaw Massacre of old which was scary.It's a different kettle of fish.Gore & more Gore.I don't get why the bad reviews for it?I liked it & will watch it again.,2022-02-23
"The plot to rebuilt a dead town is a bit weird and unnecessary, it could have been just a normal group of friend on a trip. There's nothing new in terms of the stye of writing. It's pretty much a 'woke'-er version of any slasher film you've watched. The acting is really bad (except for Yarkin and Fisher). One character literally has no dialogue because i believe his acting is so bad they decided to cuts all his line. But idk tho. Some cringe scenes, but there are also some nice scenes too.It's really bad, but i think it's a 'good' bad. Well, at least i didn't find it boring. It's good film if you're looking to mindlessly watch something, or watch it ironically.",2022-02-19
The trailer peaked my interest after that it's all down hill. My problem is 1 it looks like it was shot On Universal Studios back lot even though I know it was filmed in Bulgaria and some other place. 2 not a single ounce of story the whole time it's like why are these people hair who are they not one question really gets answered. I heard the original Directors left the project because of creator differences Aka the story sucks. 3 Every actor in this film is just someone for a body count nothing else. The fact that the director who did this project never seen the first one speaks volumes about this film. Finally the ending of the movie is just a slap in the face to the original TCM the remake and the Prequel. Who ever gave this a 10 out of 10 worked on this movie and was paid to say that.,2022-02-18
...Beautiful Story line that was destroyed by the script.. I love the history. They never developed any of the history behind the Story. Man was I looking forward to this.,2022-02-19
Im not a fan of alternate timelines in general but I can overlook that if the film is good. This one is alright. Not great but not bad. None of the young characters in this film are likable. Its not as good as the first 3 films in the series but its watchable. Nice use of gore as well.,2022-03-05
"Welp, I was hype to see new Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie, but within 3 minutes I shut it off and it became the second movie I ever gave a 1/10 after Demonicus (2001) . It's also the first movie I ever rated without watching the whole way through. Why? We couldn't even get 3 minutes into the movie without a hamfisted woke commentary on white people. If a movie relies on political commentary to hook you within the first 3 minutes it's dead on arrival and a pretty good indication of what's ahead.I managed to sit though then entirety of Demonicus before I could make it 3 minutes into this. That is saying a *hell* of alot.Netflix won't ever learn.",2022-07-16
"The color grading, cinematography, and sound design were good. That's about where it stops tho. There is no atmosphere to this movie. That's the thing all these movies are missing. Not a single set designer seems to have paid attention to the original movie. None of them can get it right. This movie relies on gore than ambience. I'd be fine with that if it was literally any other movie.",2022-07-07
"I must be getting old.. but this this thing was brutal! The violence was on 100! I used to live for these kinds of movies, but I guess I'm getting soft. Its very well paced coming in under 90 mins. I honestly don't remember any of the characters names (like it matters). I'm not sure where this franchise goes from here, but this wasn't a bad entry (I've seen them all, and the original is overrated) If you can stomach excessive violence and have 90 mins to spare, give it a watch.",2022-02-18
"Just because you put some guy in a movie with the chainsaw does not mean it's a Texas chainsaw massacre. This movie went absolutely nowhere and it got there very fast. While there are some good moments, they are very few and far between. The main actress gives a little bit of decent acting, but for the most part it's very predictable and the ending just sucked. No wonder it kept on getting bad test screenings. The premise of them even going to an empty town to create something was hokey just from the word go. There was no originality, and it looks like somebody tried to go in and basically make a C minus movie and get an F plus on it. Some of the cinematography was very good though and the make up was very good. But the direction was all over the place and the editing was just horrific.This movie is so bad it should be on Amazon not Netflix.",2022-08-29
"Leatherface returns after 50 years in this direct sequel to the original. Don't expect the filmmakers to explain how he wound up at an orphanage or who this strange lady is who has been taking care of him. Also, don't expect them to explain how a bunch of 20-somethings are able to afford to buy and entire town to create some sort of mecca for social media influencers. The original film's sole survivor, Sally Hardesty, returns for a measly 5 minutes and seems shoehorned in for no reason. It has a short enough runtime and enough of a sense of humor to not make the audience dwell on some of the story issues.",2022-03-02
This was such a waste of my time. Not only that but it was literally a Halloween 2018 ripoff. And that ending was laughable. I wanted to gouge my eyes out... such a disappointment.,2022-02-21
"I came into this film expecting the average slasher movie, it kinda was, but lacked real imagination and originality. It started of your average slasher movie with a bunch teens going to a deserted place, but when the movie continued to go on, I sorta started seeing resemblances to Halloween (2018). With this it knocked ratings down, and for me it just didn't feel original. Although this is not for me, the ending was awesome and badass which did put the rating up for me and I feel that saved this movie from been truly horrific sequel to the original.",2022-03-05
Leatherface at his best I love it from start to finish 9/10 better then the last two. 9th film needs to end somewhere but don't let it carry it on. Leather face is face quick.,2022-02-18
Couldn't be the same Leatherface. He'd be about 80 years old. Like he's going to be able to get around that good. Killing and lifting 20 something's with a chainsaw like they were made of cardboard.But the creepiness and gore was great.,2022-05-12
A few of the special effects were good and a couple of the actors were decent but neither could redeem this movie. The story line was lame and only the people that were killed early on were not idiots.,2022-02-26
"Ever since I watched the trailer I had doubts about this because many movie requests or whatever turn out to be trash. It was good and above average, of course it doesn't give justice to the original which is a masterpiece it doesn't really have a nice plot but sure it's a wild ride if you like gore in movies.",2022-03-04
"A group of teens try to renovate an old Texas ghost town. However, things go awry when they confront Leatherface.The film's direction was good, but its execution was poor. The film's direction should have followed the route Halloween 2018 went within their plot. However, the conclusion was done well. It perfectly leaves the plot open for potentially continuing the story. The killing scenes were brilliant, they were visually gruesome and appealing specifically the scene where a bunch of gen zs are trapped in a bus while Leatherface brutally massacre them. I thought the idea was perfectly executed. The aesthetics and design for Leatherface looked terrifying in this sequel. However, I was not a fan of the performance of Sarah Yarkin and Elsie Fisher in this film. I thought both performances were bland throughout a few scenes in the film.Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2022 was a sequel that had potential, but it winds up a film that wasn't necessary.",2022-02-19
"Genuinely awful movie, possibly the worst movie I have ever seen, taking into account this movies pretty high budget.After about 30minutes, I really felt the only thing to do was take it as a comedy spoof on the horror/slasher genre, then it became just about bearable.Everything about the original has been lost. It seems they were trying to cash in on the recent Halloween sequels success by having an elderly revenge seeking Jamie Lee Curtis ripoff character.The most annoying thing about the movie is how nothing they do is possible. From the bizarre unbelievable 'revive the town' premise, to the age of leatherface, (he should have been about 70years old), plus the chainsaw(no rust?), also chainsaw(blades go blunt), also chainsaw(who has used a chainsaw that could cut through floorboards and strut in under a second...), finally if people have chainsaws cut through them, they don't stay alive for 5 minutes...
Awful movie.",2022-02-21
"Giving two stars because the main character is literally Carl from TWD. Cowboy hat and all. The film was incredibly entertaining from that point of view. Pretty much what I expected, some entertaining bits, and appropriately annoying characters. The addition of a Carl lookalike was a bonus.",2022-02-19
2022 just started and this is certified *the worst film of 2022*. The acting fills me with joy because I'm convinced anyone can make it as an actor. The writing is horrific and it's no wonder they had to sell this steaming pile of garbage to Netflix just so people would watch it.,2022-02-21
"If you're going into any film in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise, it's probably best to keep your expectations low since none of them, besides Tobe Hooper's original and, maybe, the Marcus Nispel remake from 2003 have approached anything close to frightening. This reboot, just like 2018's Halloween, pretends the other sequels never happened and brings back the original film's heroine with mixed results. The rest is a charmingly idiotic slash fest with some of the most annoying characters being sawed through by Leatherface who has, for whatever reason, been hiding in an orphanage for the past 50 years. Don't expect the film to tell you why or answer any of the other many questions you'll have about story logic or character motivations and just go along for the ride.",2022-02-23
I personally believe there's many people out there that consider themselves to be high praised film critics but they need to stop. The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a cult classic due to its gore and insane story of a chainsaw wielding man killing teens. The franchise does not need to be the next Get Out or Hereditary. 2022's Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a damn good time! There is gore and a lot of cool scenes. The plot doesn't have to be great it just needs to get the story moving forward and introduce the audience to the massacre and this time there truly was one. This movie is a great time if you are a fan or if you're just trying to have a horror movie night. We're here to see a chainsaw wielding man do his thing and they delivered!,2022-02-19
"Not Bad Not Great, like always in Horror Movies people make stupid decisions thats my BIG Bad Point , other then that the Special Effects are great , great amout of Gore too, the cast is ""cool"" and acts great i like the background story some of them have , but if you have the chance to shoot that MF then DO IT!!!!! DO IT!!! Shut up and DO ITTT!! If not you DESERVE to DIE the WORST Possible WAY! , but Leatherface has Plot Armor thats the second bigger Bad Ponit, but movie is short and i was entertain'd the whole time , so it was way better then expected , but not a Masterpiece.Yes you will Faceplant yourself a few times , because of stupid decisions but times goes by quickly and People die in a Gory way, so get your Popcorn and Enjoy.",2022-02-20
"As someone who hasn't seen the original, I can honestly say that the first half of the film was relatively attention grabbing. There were multiple scenes that showed promise of a half decent horror film. The second half was absolute gash. Cheesy lines, terrible acting, unrelatable decisions and a sudden immunity to bullets and chainsaws.I wish I got my head cut off before I saw that ending.",2022-08-12
"If you really want to do yourself a favor, you will turn it off after the first 15 minutes. The entire budget was spent on some really cool special effects, but 75 minutes of repetitive grotesque special effects does not make a very enjoyable movie. (although all three stars did come solely from special effects.There was no plot. Seriously. Don't bother stressing over trying to figure one out. The dialogue was patently ridiculous.The latest theme in horror seems to be to make a relatable, sympathetic chaotic and totally psychotic spree killer that we all want to give a warm hug to as he rampages around, mutilating highly undesirable and extremely annoying masses of idiotic people that also happen to be some of the worst actors ever. Well, total success on that front.Not.one.gun.fired.correctly.ever. Makes me think America is stockpiling the wrong weapon. LMAO at that message.",2022-03-26
"I am fan of the TCM films, and with that comes a certain expectation of cheesy-ness to go along (as most slashers do) but not when that cheese is crap splattered with mold. This was a HUGE let down and poor attempt. There was potential for greatness here, especially with integrating a former character from original story. But when things dont match and everything becomes more absurd as it goes, it just gets.. pathetic?... Annoying? The first remake with Jessica Biel had a very real and very believable story and setting. Not so much here. The young kids in this version are the ""hippies"" of GenX today, and they do well to annoy. Making parts enjoyable to watch as they get theirs. But the more unrealistic these films are, the less scary it is and wrong kind of cheese. I was too annoyed to even watch in one sitting.",2022-10-28
"I understand that people in horror movies have to act counterintuitive so that it frustrates you when you watch it. As in: Take his gun, man. Oh no, he left the gun on the floor. What an idiot.I suppose it creates a nightmarish scenario, you know, that dream when you can´t run away from something.But if it is overdone, it becomes unbelievable and stupid. And the extreme violence then does nothing. In fact, when he cuts through an entire bus full of people (and not one soul gets past him), I found myself laughing and that is a weird response to people getting cut in half.So the entire story that unfolds seems just ridiculous. And much like with Jason, when the villain is just a unresponsive killing machine (with superpowers?), I can´t care enough. My recommendation: Avoid and watch Neil Marshall´s The Descent (THE BRITISH ONE!!) instead. Now that is one fine horror movie.",2022-04-24
"I found this film to be enjoyable. I liked the sisters. Leatherface is literally entirely supernatural at this point and can survive anything. The gore was awesome! The bus scene was totally insane. (I was totally rooting for Leatherface though after the ""try anything and you're cancelled, bro"" line.) The 8/10 is probably mostly because I'm still in shock from the ending, which was totally awesome! Although, that might change since I'm pissed about their brutal and honestly practically comical slaying of OG final girl, Sally. And in retrospect, it is totally Melody's fault she died, she was WAY too leasuerly about leaving that town. Anyways, I reccomend this movie- for people who either don't give a crap or are Texas Chainsaw fans.",2022-02-22
"Put your brain on standby and enjoy the thrill ride.Gets into the gore pretty quickly into the movie and doesn't let up. No need to have seen the previous movies as all is explained in a 5 min shop sequence.No Oscar's to be won here but it ticks all the boxes. Yes , it's all been done before but Leatherface is proper scary and he doesn't fail to up the body count.The bus scene is brilliant.Thank you for this movie.Don't pick holes. Just enjoy.",2022-02-21
"""Try anything and you're cancelled bro."" said a man to Leatherface while recording on his phone.This is a line from the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie. It's promoted as a direct sequel to the original, Halloween-2018-style. The story is about a group of young influencers. Who are they? We don't care, all we know is one of them is being the ""final girl"". They are here to auction off an old town in the middle of nowhere. Isn't that the greatest place ever to do a horror movie?They meet a not-so-friendly mechanic. Who is he? We don't care. One of the young people dies when going to the hospital with an old woman having a heart attack. Killed by no other than Leatherface.This movie is bloody. Bloody all the way with a massacre in a bus so bloody you think this is blood porn (although it kind of is). The movies's only good thing is the direction, but it doesn't mean it looks great. The shots are so damn yellowish, and they aren't even in Mexico.Sally Hardesty from the original Texas Chainsaw is also here. I don't see the need to bring her back as she's just a final girl in the 1974 film. She isn't like Laurie Strode, who is better characterised and just more interesting. She ""has been waiting for that day for 50 years,"" she says. No, Leatherface is the waiting one. You always had a chance to kill him.Speaking of chances, when Sally has the gun pointed at Leatherface, you'd think she'll savagely shoot him. But no, she lets Mr. Massacre himself walk away. The only time she shoots him is two minutes after she's been ripped in half by him. She is severely damaged by the chainsaw, but she can still live for another 2 minutes, shoots Leatherface, and talks to the final girl, and then heroically dies. This is so moving and realistic that I wanted to tear up.So yeah, the guys who made Don't Breathe wrote the story and produced Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2022. The movie is an idiotic bloody mess. My favourite scene is the last one when Leatherface swings his chainsaw to the camera. Seems like he didn't want to be there, too.",2022-03-01
"This was one of the worst things ever and not just on TV!The first half of this movie I was in stitches. It was unintentionally hilarious but then it suddenly just hit me and I realised this is just sad a poor excuse for a texas chainsaw movie.Who actually sat there while filming and thought, yeah this movie is great. They should be ashamed of themselves.Utter turd.What is going on nowadays. I've seen better B movies from the 80s with better acting and story.This film is so bad. It doesn't even make sense. So it's been 50 years so leatherface is at least 70 in this but moves like a 20 year old.Acting 1/10
Story 1/10I forgot that people can get chainsawed in the chest get thrown 10 feet and still be alive lol and even talk. I'm actually embarrassed that I wasted my time on this piece of turd and NETFLIX you should be ASHAMED of yourself. An absolutely pathetic attempt. This isnt even worthy of being a sequel to the classic.Shocked and appalled and I hate the fact that some people actually said this isn't a bad movie. I'm sorry but if you think that then you shouldn't be watching films and stick to cartoons or something.Anyway that's my opinion.STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!!!",2022-02-19
"If you want to see blood, gore and mayhem with not much of a plot.The movie has its 2022 moments - everyone takes out their phone to start filming the killer - but a basic blood and guts film with the odd moment of excitement.",2022-04-30
"Atmosphere, suspense, acting, oh wait, you get none of that here. At 83 minutes long, the scariest part is that I needed to watch this over 3 days. Attempts at social commentary were mediocre at best. Characters you just don't care about. I would give this a 0 star but it had blood. Do yourself a favor, watch the original masterpiece and forget this was ever made.",2022-02-23

Of course its not perfect but damn was it close. Its the horror film we have needed from this series in quite some time. I'll never understand the hate this film gets but it deserves more love. People need to stop thinking every horror film needs to be the next Jordan Peele movie. We need horror films like these just as much as we need Peele films.,2022-02-19
"The movies detracts from the Chainsaw films. Too much ridiculous 2022 garbage. No common sense from the characters and the story/plot is bland. References gun violence, wokeness, social media and cancel culture. Just pure 2022 ridiculousness.I wasted my time sitting through this. Please avoid if you respect the Chainsaw films.I'm not sure how to honestly justify this dumpster fire of a movie. JUST AVOID!! If you chose not to, well, make sure you have something else worth while to watch. You'll be disappointed. If you're one of the few who does like this, well good. I'm glad the efforts of the cast and crew didn't go to a complete waste. However, with that said, more people will dislike this movie than like it.What I DID like about this movie? Well short of watching the end credits, nothing redeeming comes to mind. Just avoid it.... Really.",2022-02-22
I loved how this was so unique of a movie and it brought out a different approach to horror movie making in 2022.This was by FAR the best horror Chainsaw movie EVER.,2022-02-20
"I don't like to put modern remakes/sequels up against the original, so consider this as just another horror. On that basis, it's typically average but if you enjoy horror then it's a decent watch on a Sunday night. The victims are insufferably awful, so I feel like I'm on the side of Leatherface. Acting was average, though I found Sarah Yarkin to be terrible - she can't act and her facial expressions are awkwardly fake. Poor casting decision that drops my rating to a 4.",2022-02-26
"Slasher films always get rated low, but for those who enjoy them, this is exactly what you're looking for. 1 hour and 20 mins of nonstop heart pumping gore and meteocre characters. I was certainly entertained the entire film. For a sequel it's atleast different from the original but still has that chainsaw massacre feel. Go Leather face!",2022-02-22
This wasn't one of them.Lamest set of characters that could possibly have been cast.83 minutes but it felt like 803.The gory bits were what took my score up to 4.It went up by 5.,2022-02-19
"Horrible acting and the plot was stupid!! Easy to film an abandoned town with no one around but stupid new generation kids who don't know what the hell is going on! Great violence though, that's why I gave it a 4. Huge TCM fan and was disappointed. Loved the ending though! Crazy credits scene after the ending credits! No tribute to Tobe Hooper or Marilyn Burns neither 😡",2022-02-18
"This was alright, completely serviceable middle of the road streaming fodder which immediately robs it of any reason to exist or an identity.They'll probably make more now. I'm not angry or enthused either way, this series has long run its course. I went in realistically without expectations, all I ask for at this point is entertainment, but the overall lack of focus and creativity make this one much worse than it could and should have been.The original is a classic still, one of the few horror movies that truly transcends its genre. Like its peers, the proto slashers of Black Christmas and Communion it just oozes 1970s cynicism and is filled with deeply nihilistic blunt violence that gets under your skin. Even without gore it is truly unsettling and strangely artistic in its misanthropy, similar to a Francis Bacon or Otto Dix painting.Only the Marcus Nispel remake managed to come close to this atmosphere. It's slicker, more stylish and very graphic but it packs a similar punch and once it starts going it doesn't let up and just pommels you. None of the various sequels come anywhere close, this new one included. Instead of a disturbing nightmare filled with subtext its yet another generic slasher wearing the skin of a classic, somewhat ironically. A shallow exercise, never suspenseful or tense at any moment it copies visuals and plot points from the horror genre without understanding their purpose.But a few positives first, this wasn't a horrible ordeal for better or worse. The actors are doing fine and the brief gore scenes are fun if lacking in impact and creativity. The run time is quite short too, yet even at roughly 80 minutes it barely held my interest all the way through. Dumped on Netflix has long become the new Direct to Video at this point. While there will always be quality shows and movies on streaming services breaking the mold, the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre is merely next in a long line of lacklustre entertainment, that passes the time but ultimately leaves you with nothing.The movie business still hasn't fully begun to recover from the pandemic and I can't blame Netflix for not having the biggest confidence in the franchise to put up a sizeable budget beforehand, but there's no reason the movie had to look this cheap and small. A lack of budget can be an asset if a clever filmmaker is behind the wheel, yet a lack of focus as portrayed here is the kiss of death. I will cut a flawed film a lot of slack if it feels like someone with passion was behind it, but safe for the two lead actresses it feels like everyone else was just going through the motions. If you have to keep making these turkeys, and I know you do because it's a recognizeable title, why not give it to an experienced indie director with a voice? Have Ari Aster make a Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie. He's made a successful career out of bringing aesthetically pleasing, grotesque horror that makes you want to puke to a large audience, he'd be a perfect fit.While I was watching TCM 2022, it did feel like a minor if noticeable step up from the other recent sequels, prequels, remakes etc, but writing this review a mere 10 minutes after I've watched it I'm not so positive it won't prove just as forgettable as the myriad of its siblings.While the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series isn't quite as wrecked, confused and botched as the Halloween franchise it stands to reason it should have never been a series in the first place. The Tobe Hooper original belongs in a film museum, most of the sequels belong on bargain bin 10 movie dvd packs.",2022-02-22
This movie was so terrible. They should be ashamed to call this a Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie. There are so many things so wrong with this and the landscape being obviously wrong stands out as soon as the movie begins. Story plot is awful. Just a complete insult to horror movie fans especially those that love the classics.,2022-02-21
"I was a bit sceptical at the beginning of the film because some of the later Texas chainsaw movies were dull and not even brutal, but overall this is a fun and modern reboot that gives the franchise a breath of new life. I especially liked that leatherface finally has more personality, and actors are less boring than in previous installments. If you like horror movies, you're gonna love this one. My rating compares with other horror movies, not with movies in general, of course :).",2022-02-22
"Not a bad slasher, the camerawork is first-class, the production is also good. But the story itself, the script itself is very primitive, of course, there are very bad movies, but you could try! Is it really so difficult to come up with a fascinating and realistic story? I did not like that the plot is based on ridiculous conventions: the mother of a maniac suddenly dies, a Texan takes the car keys, an elderly woman does not shoot at a maniac and lets him go, a pump-action shotgun shoots like a pistol, and in general - no one is able to stop or kill a ""Homicidal Maniac"", bullets do not cause any damage to him, it can't be cut with a chainsaw, it can't be drowned in water, and it can't be destroyed at all! How convenient :) - funny and scary, already fun!",2023-08-17

"Poor storyline? Yes! Flat, unlikable characters? Sure! With the emphasis on unlikable. Predictable? AlsoBut, you knew that right? That all these ingredients would be there. Still, go watch this movie. I assure you the bus-scene and the ending will make it worth you while.",2022-02-22
"I was really looking forward to this movie for quite some time. First off, the only positives from this movie were the killing scenes as they were very good-looking. Full of gore, very realistic looking. Typical Leatherface, cutting his victims in half with his saw. Not to mention the location, it was really cool. I really liked the setting of the film. However, that is all the positive news.The characters in this movie are not likeable at all - it's the type of movie where there is barely any character development, therefore it makes you not really like or care for any of the characters. The scene where Leatherface was on the bus and they all took their phones out.... Not a great movie for the series.",2022-03-09
"After the trailer premiered, I set my expectations very low for this new installment in the TCM franchise. While I'm a fan of the original and can enjoy elements of the remake, the TCM franchise has a rough history when it comes to sequels. Beginning with TCM 2, the sequels have never been able to recreate the lightning in a bottle feeling of the original.Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2022) continues that trend with a direct sequel to the '74 classic. While the film features great gore and kills, the storyline leaves a lot to be desired. The cannibalistic nature of the original family seems to have been dropped entirely to pursue something more akin to Norman Bates in Psycho (1960).Even with a short run time, the middle seemed to drag and there was a lot of downtime in between acts of violence. Watching a character hide under a bed for 10 minutes doesn't make for a stimulating viewing experience.As far as characters go, Elsie Fisher as Lila felt miscast. I adored Fisher in Eighth Grade (2018), but her character lacked agency. Lila survived a school shooting and while the film hints at how this could affect the story, it ultimately goes nowhere. I felt that Melody (Sarah Yarkin) was the more obvious choice as the final girl. She fought back and seized opportunities while her sister, Lila, just stood there.Speaking of going nowhere, the inclusion of Sally Hardesty (Olwen Fouere) felt shoehorned in and unnecessary. My least favorite trope in horror films is when a character has the upper hand on the killer and instead of taking the shot, allows them to get away. I don't understand how a character that has been hunting for this man for 50 years decides to monologue instead of shooting him while she had the chance. Killing Sally off felt more like shock value than the natural conclusion for her character.It's a fun popcorn flick and if you can get past some terrible dialogue, ""Do anything and you're cancelled bro,"" and some shots that induce laughter, Leatherface popping his head out of the dead sunflower field, you may be pleasantly surprised. A Texas Chainsaw movie in name alone, you can find worse ways to spend an hour and a half.",2022-02-18
"This was a terrible film. They killed off the old lady in a seemingly blatant screw you to Halloween's Jamie Lee Curtis' continued survival, the deaths were almost 100% predictable (spoiler alert: only ONE person survives!!) and the ONLY dude who had a realistic chance at surviving a real-life encounter with this guy gets done in by a freaking broken piece of window glass??? Come ON!! Oh, and the last killing was dumb AF, sicario-style execution for the hell of it. Honestly, the only deaths that seemed worthy of this franchise were the girl in the sheriffs van and the lady croaking to set Leatherface off on his spree. 2 seconds' worth out of a 90 minute flick - what a waste.",2022-03-08
"One of the best TCM movies I've seen in a long time coming from a hardcore horror fan! I haven't had this much fun since the Evil Dead 2013 remake. This film shines in many aspects that I was looking for. Impressive Leatherface horror, creative kills, epic soundtrack, well-done tension & use of sound. Great cinematography and use of lighting. Special effects are near excellent.There's also a very aesthetically pleasing credits scene that I watched all the way through (something I never do). There's a post-credits scene as well which is awesome.Characters: Surprisingly some likeable qualities but like with most TCM movies, we root for Leatherface and the same mostly applies here. There's a few sensitive scenes/topics where if it's a turn-off for you, I'd recommend powering through. Surprisingly this movie does a solid job of combating controversy with providing perspective and displaying humanity between characters in regards to common ground.Conclusion - TCM offers a lot of new style and substance as a fine addition to the series while paying just the right amount of respect toward the original.Overall, I know this isn't a cinematic masterpiece but I'm giving this a 10/10 as a fun horror movie & a sequel beyond expectations + to offset the point subtraction horror movies usually get on IMDb due to the genre.",2022-02-18
"If you're into super gory and graphic violent movies, then this is a good one for you. But if you like good movies with solid characters and a believable storyline, then look somewhere else. Yes is as generic as they come with literally no storyline whatsoever. Don't get me wrong, I like good special effects and violence in the horror movies I watch but they need to be somewhat believable and they absolutely have to have a solid storyline to rest on. You will find none of that here.",2022-03-05
"It just doesn't have any kind of impact. Could have been so much more. Did not care for any of the characters. Just came away feeling a bit meh!

"Like many horror movies this isn't complicated, you have characters you aren't meant to like, and they are killed off one by one in entertaining ways. Not sure what people are upset about, it is a monster with a chainsaw, an Ed Gein Leather face character that can't be reasoned with and doesn't stop coming. The kills come early and fast, and there is very little ""dumb for the plot"", people behave naturally and there are few moments such as the usual turning the back on the monster.It is what it says on the tin, a Texas Chainsaw Massacre.",2022-03-16
"This was such a great time. After two REALLY bad sequels that where nothing short of slaps to the face of not only chainsaw fans but the movie going audience in general, I was really not expecting to even like this. But what the hell, I really dug the franchise growing up. This really was the best sequel I think they could have done. The trailer had me worried that I would hate the characters and it would just kind of be old hat with a buncha meta politically slanted gen Zisms. And there IS THAT But the characters work IS fairly solid as well, completely making up for the obvious studio head decisions. The cringy dialogue you see in the trailer is the extent of the cringy woke commentary. The tone of the movie is genuinely creepy and makes what could be several laughable scenes somehow work and really hard to laugh at. The violence is shocking and after 9 movies I have no idea how they managed to do that, and at the same time it's not just a lazily written blood thirsty Leatherface we've seen in bad iteration after bad iteration. He's been a good boy for 50 years mind you. The fact that he's grief motivated was a great touch. This one really took me by suprize. Not at all what I suspected in the best way imaginable!If I'd rank them ( I'm goin to) I gotta go with1.) The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1974
2.) the Texas chainsaw Masacre 2003
3.) Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2022

"This movie is Netflix's attempt to cash in with their own Halloween (2018). Like Halloween (2018) this movie ignores all the other sequels that came after. Like Halloween (2018) the original survivor is now an old woman who has waited and prepared to kill the killer. Unlike Halloween (2018) this movie feels cheap. Now I don't love Halloween (2018) but it is decent, this movie on the other hand is dull.Leatherface has been dormant for almost 50 years (since the first movie in 1974). His foster mother seemingly being the reason he has behaved but when she dies in the movie he goes back to killing. The character Leatherface would be around 70 years old at least. The character has never been shown as being supernatural but instead an inbred giant with ""retard strength"". Somehow he is still just as spry as he used to be.The movie has gore for the gore lovers so that is one piece of good news. Otherwise the characters are annoying and the movie feels more silly than eerie.I will say though, the ending scene is hilariously awesome.",2022-02-27
"Another reboot, sequel, legacy, or timeline. At this point, I've given up trying to track what is what across all the horror franchises. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is no different, and to me, one of the more confusing ones. Even when you get the timelines down, they don't seem to logically line up. The Massacre franchise is without a doubt my least favorite franchise as a whole. I love the original and the 2003 remake. Aside from them, I could get away with never watching one again and be fine. Now we have yet another sequel, this time following the Halloween 2018 mold and being a direct sequel to the original, bringing back the original final girl.Nearly 50 years after the original massacre, Leatherface has gone into hiding and no traces have been found. A group of young friends, led by Melody (Sarah Yarkin) and her sister Lila (Elsie Fisher), and chef Dante (Jacob Latimore) and his girlfriend Ruth (Nell Hudson), head to the ghost town of Harlow with the hopes of revitalizing the once bustling town. Once a resident is removed from the old orphanage, Leatherface (Mark Burnham) is reawakened to take his town back, all the while the original final girl, Sally (Olwen Fouere), comes back for revenge.This is the second feature film by director David Blue Garcia and, while the finished product may not agree, the film was directed pretty well. It's hard to tell if this was his vision or if the film was hacked apart by the hire-ups. As for the writing of the film, there is a lot to be desired. We know that Leatherface isn't going to get any type of character development, and we also know that just about every character is a throwaway character in the end, but the horrible dialogue and no arcs leave no one to get behind. There is a small backstory involving Lila's past traumas that could have gone somewhere but felt flat. The inclusion of Sally is a blatant rip-off of Halloween 2018 and serves no purpose.On a technical level, the cinematography stands above everything. The cinematography is a better character than anyone presented on screen, with the exception of Richter (Moe Dunford), who I actually liked, and keeps the film watchable until we get to the saving grace of the film, the violence. The team went with a blend of practical and CGI for the gore and it is night and day. Practicality will always win that battle, but for this film, the bloodbath is what saves it. Maybe the writers and production team knew there was no salvaging the franchise, so they just gave the fans what they wanted: large amounts of blood and violence.When it comes to acting performances, they are nonexistent. Mark Burnham, portraying Leatherface, who, I might add, should be in his 70's and is running around like a track star, but his look and brooding presence keep the film alive. Like I previously stated, I liked Moe Dunford as the local mechanic tough guy. The rest of the cast hit their marks and kept the film moving, but that is about it.The problems here are glaring and frequent. The bad writing, unlikable characters, bringing back legacy characters, horrendous dialogue, it's hard to not pick it apart. The gore, which is the saving grace of the film, actually looks really bad when you see the CGI work on it. The film's length is only 83 minutes, including credits, and it could have benefited from a few minutes here and there to try and get you to like some characters and add a little depth.Now that I've just ripped the film apart, I would actually watch it again. It's so mindless that you can just throw it on and not pay attention until Leatherface goes on a rampage. I do really like the look they gave him, which I didn't at first. This film is going to divide audiences, and I'm sure the producers are fine with that. This could even be enough to make us suffer through another sequel reboot legacy timeline jump sometime in the near future.",2022-02-20

"Ahhh. So sad. I was looking forward to this SO MUCH! I have watched every TCM film many times, and some have been hit and miss, this was totally a miss. Each director has their own vision, this guys vision sucked.Watching an interview with him talking about this film, he said he wanted to de-humanise the killer, why on earth would you want to do that? The film's where you actually feel for the killer, and sometimes feel sorry for him, and understand WHY he does what he does makes the character so much deeper. A person just killing for the sake of killing has no depth and is very surface level. Yeah...his care giver died in the van, but the police were trying to SAVE her. This goes against all previous story line where he only attacks people who are a threat to him or his family. In this film, he just murders everyone needlessly and without any reason. Lame. Let me write your next film god damn it. Don't taint the franchise with such poor stories.",2022-03-26
"Remeber in the original how Leatherface would react to pain and get hurt? Now he can take multiple close shotgun blasts, a stabing and a chainsaw upercut and carry on with his killings. Sounds familiar.And I may not be a doctor but I'm sure if someone stuck a massive chainsaw through my 70 odd year old stomach then lifted me above their head and reved the hell out of the chainsaw I would die instantly and not fire off a weapon 5 minutes later. (Why inculde the Sally character at all?)A woke film without a single likable character. And that includes Leatherface who is basically now Michael Myers and invincible. But I guess money from a franchise is the key and as long as we watch it then anything goes.A woke film without a single likable character.

"I would have given this film a 6 if it was a story that stood on it's own. Instead, it's a remake that's considered a sequel with the same exact name (but no good qualities) as the original film in 1974. Have we really gotten to a point that we can't come up with original sequel names so we can differentiate which movie is which?Anywho, the movie felt like a gorefest with overly ridiculous kills. The acting was alright, I only liked one actor and he didn't last long so I was bored after that. Cinematography looks great of course. I do really wish they stuck to a similar story of leatherface so that the connection to the original made better sense.So if you're not a fan of older horror films but a fan of of insane gore, you might just like this movie. As for me, I will never watch this movie again.",2022-02-18
"Don't waste your time on this pile of .... I literally felt my IQ dropping just by watching this trash. Politically correct, feminist propaganda and totally devoid of logic. Leatherface can teleport, has better hearing than Daredevil, is as strong as the hulk and unkillable, also he kills people for no reason whatsoever (which is fine actually BUT). 10 minutes later he has worse hearing than a deaf person, decides to not kill someone because he didn't feel like it or IDK. This is the biggest travesty that they have done to this franchise, last few movies were bad, but man this takes is to a whole new level. The only viewing pleasure that this movie might bring is to get drunk with friends and laugh at how stupid it is. At one point i thought it was a parody, like Scary Movie.",2022-06-07
"This is the best sequel to the original of Texas chainsaw massacre, the story is good, the main characters are fine and Leatherface is perfect.Mark Burnham is great choice for the role and
Elsie Fisher is also incredible actor.But bring back Sally Hardesty is stupid decision, seriously it's a waste and I didn't like her appearance.Overall, the movie is awesome and it's worth to watch it and enjoy the sequel.Long Live Leatherface.",2022-02-19
This film comes nowhere close to the original. I found it to be corny as hell. Certain scenes were comical in how unbelievable they were. Honestly don't waste your time on this one.,2022-02-20
"Actually entertaining, funny seeing the woke crowd downvoting it. I've seen all the originals, remember people, movies are meant to be entertaining, nothing more, people try to read into them.The woke crowd, I'm sorry but what was shown was well done and keeps up with the time.There's no other message here :P stop looking for it.Kept to the original plots, idiot kids get killed.",2022-02-21
I'm so tired of seeing the same narrative in scary movies. All the capable male character are killed off easily and the weak female characters become overpowering to take on the bad guy. It's so disgusting to watch as it really takes any sort of belief out of the film. I guess it's all in the name of female empowerment and males being expendable.,2022-02-20
"The newest installment in the texas chainsaw massacre franchise is certainly nothing new, it doesn't stray away from the slasher formula it helped to build. The movie is what you expect, a series of events that lead to immense gore, screaming, body parts flying around, and a group of young adults ready to be torn apart.However, I found this movie to be way better than any other of the recent sequels that have plagued the cinematic landscape, certainly leagues better than texas chainsaw 3D and the much-maligned prequel Leatherface. The movie is expertly shot, with fantastic set pieces of increasing violence and suspense and with genuinely unsettling imagery that will make get you hooked on the screen. The movie is simply fun! Its traps and chases are entertaining, they will make one's brain turn off for 90 minutes while we watch the ensuing carnage on screen.The movie's greatest sin, in my opinion, is the wasting of certain characters that seem like an afterthought and the lack of development overall (even though the leads kinda get fleshed out a bit). The movie also tries to insert social commentary into its story, but it's so brushed over and hollow that it simply falls flat on its face.When it's simply a slasher about a group of young people getting slaughtered, that's when the movie shines, turning Leatherface into a genuinely scary villain again and letting his full rage get loose.Overall, this movie is flawed but it's also a fun slasher that horror fans will appreciate for its popcorn value.",2022-02-18
The people who are hating on this film can't be genuine Horror fans. It has EVERYTHING I hoped for in this film. Gore and more Gore. Just wait till the ending. 😱,2022-02-18
"Some good gore/kills, but that doesn't make up for horrible writing, directing, acting, plotline, etc. Netflix makes 20 crappy originals for every good one, so they soon should just stop.",2022-02-21
"This is a solid horror movie. There are many extremely negative reviews for this film, and film is subjective so i get it; however this is a horror sequel in a series that is plagued by many sub par sequels and remakes, and prequels so how critical can one be? WHAT IF...we look at films like this as ""what if"" scenarios (like marvel?). We don't have to look at every sequel as ""cannon"", but as ""what if THIS happened?"" That can make the disappointing elements of the films easier to swallow.That being said, this movie was well shot, looked great, Leatherface is portrayed as well as ever, and the one main disappointing part for me didn't completely kill the story for me. I am an avid old school horror movie fan, i don't care for much of the modern horror films being made today, but this was a fun outing back into the world of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Thanks to the cast, crew, writers, and director! Cheers!",2022-02-25
"Where to start here. Don't go into this film expecting a good tcsm remake or follow up. It's full of the typical cliche slasher movie ideas. The movie doesn't offer a real story line and instead just uses the typical low budget slasher movie genre way of thinking. There is zero charictor development, tension and a serious lack of logic. The old lady/survivor that rocks up to save the day is mangled by the chainsaw and held in the air while the chainsaw is mashing up her insides and then tossed a big rubbish pile... Well that's her dead.... Uhhhh nope... Somehow she still manages to lay there and a few minutes later shoot leather face. At this point of the film its become comical . Our mangled faced killer finds his chainsaw that's been sat still for 50 years. Magically it starts with about 5 pulls. By absolute miracle it hadn't siezed up and the fuel in it wasn't off and stale 🙄. He then gets beaten up, stabbed, shot with a shot gun twice, drowned, punched, hit with a chainsaw, hit by a car and knocked unconscious and he is still alive and well. Not bad going for a guy that's now around 70 to 75 years old and been hiding for 50 years. This movie is total trash and shouldn't even be associated with the original. Borderline comedy. Avoid at all costs.",2022-03-14
This movie is full of characters you either don't care about or want to see die. The only bright spot is the bus scene. Watching a bunch of woke hipster milenials get run through with a chainsaw made me smile.,2022-02-18
"It was fun. Don't except the shock and awe of the original but it did what it intended to do. It didn't really help things that the only likable character was the second victim of the infamous leather face.I don't think I'd watch it again, but overall fun decent horror movie if you like the slasher genre.",2022-02-22
"I actually was looking forward to this entry in the Texas Chainsaw franchise. Having a talent like Fede Alvarez involved with the story and producing showed promise. Unfortunately though it's yet again another lacklustre effort. The thing that made the original great was it's gritty realism and disturbing imagery, where this just looks like your typical glossy slasher flick. The characters aren't memorable at all. Say what you will about the 2003 remake and it's prequel but at least they had some interesting characters and performances. Since those films we've just had failed reboot after reboot. This movie has some decent gore (although a little too much cgi involved) and it has the stand out bus scene going for it but other than that the story is lacking, a returning original character is wasted completely and believability is stretched thin a few times (characters seem to be able to do a lot of fighting with bad if not fatal injuries). All in all this film is watchable but forgettable, ok for a one off watch but it's certainly not a return to form for the series which is a shame.",2022-02-21
"TL;DR (EXTENSIVE REVIEW)Texas Chainsaw Massacre, to me, was just another one of those really cheesy and over-the-top horror franchises for the sake of being shocking, and nothing more. Looking back at the first two films released, I began to appreciate them a lot more and seeing the director's vision; he wanted to create something fresh and overwhelming for a new audience that would appreciate those creations. In return, I found myself loving the first two films altogether. I never bothered to watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre: Next Generation, or even Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3.Yet, I did see the remakes in 2003 and 2006. Both, I found to be underwhelming (which on the contrary, is surprisingly disagreeable with most fans) and didn't really pay much attention to the latter of the franchise soon after.When I had seen the announcements of a new Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I felt that tingling sense of intrigue that there was a possibility for this franchise to receive the Halloween treatment and possibly grow into a much more mature and darker toned film that competes it's much desired writing and realism (as such with the first film) but once again, it didn't meet those expectations after all, at least, to a degree.For me, Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2022) stood out as a very humble, 83-minute jam-packed gore-fest that relied on what the made first one stand out: shock factor. I think that this movie suffered a heap of studio interference/management that created differences in the director's vision for what he wanted this film to be. I can see that this was designed as a complete reboot/sequel to the first film, disregarding the rest of the series and an attempt to bring a new generation to the franchise. Do I believe this was the right way? Kind of? It's weird...Throughout the entirety of its short runtime, there really isn't much plot or story to bounce off of which is pretty similar when comparing it to the first film, where a bunch of teenagers drive out to the countryside of Texas and find themselves in a Hell that is inescapable, with one of the group being the Final Girl to get out. It's cliché, but that's what made the first film work, and it's done here in a manner similar. The characters are lackluster when it comes to feeling sympathy/empathy or even remotely having interest in their backgrounds aside from one character in particular, but that character is never expanded upon. Some familiar characters return, but it's nothing noteworthy or worthwhile- in fact, it is almost alarming with how the returning characters are written and poorly used. And of course, the staple of the franchise: Leatherface, returns.What I think really didn't help the film whatsoever was the complete lack of any characterization for Leatherface; almost in conjunction to the sequels and reboots that were made, trying to humanize the antagonist. Because here, there is no explanations or given coverage as to who Leatherface is (assuming that this film is meant for new people and to expand its reach to a generation that may have never seen a Texas Chainsaw Massacre film) and to me, that felt skewed in all the wrong ways. Again, this is a sequel so I guess in contradiction, some people would already be aware that they know who Leatherface is. I still believe that having more explanation on his character in this film, would've enhanced the experience and intrigue of his motives (because Leatherface does have a lot of depth, no different than Michael Meyer's and Jason Vorhees) but it is hardly touched upon.Aside from the abhorrent plot, and uninteresting characters- this movie does offer some of the franchise's most brutal kills and practical effects which I loved to death in this film. I do believe that is this film's saving grace, which isn't a lot to run with, but as a horror film? It's perfect. You're not really being burdened with a odyssey slow-burn similar to Hereditary or The Lighthouse where that horror is intentionally built up over a period of time... in here, this is all throw at the viewer practically right away. It's a sudden, jolting amount of violence and sadism thrown all into a singular location and never lets up at that point. I think they nailed this to a tee, and that encapsulates the shock factor of the franchise and what it was known for.I think the main issues a lot of people are having with this are expecting this to be a significantly more deep, social commentary horror that enlightens on the terrors of rural life and country folk- possibly the dreadful feelings of being alone in a unknown place with no help from the outside. Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) gloated this message loudly. And it is loved and regarded by fans because of this.With all that has been said and done, I believe the film is a short paced horror that will embrace the more popular pieces of the franchise, but lack in everything around it. This film unfortunately just slips everywhere else and isn't captivating as a Texas Chainsaw Massacre film, but as a stand-alone horror movie, I think it does itself enough justice to get by. I would recommend any new viewer to at least give it a watch, but to not have high expectations unless you just have an itch for some shock factor and gore- everything else with story, characters and pacing is out the window with this movie.The franchise really hasn't moved anywhere and it's still stagnant here with this entry, which is sad considering the success of the rebooted Halloween films and the promising rise of Slashers again, but there may still be hope for a much more competent entry in this stale franchise that is dirty, greasy and disgusting- over time, we will never know the fate of the franchise, especially after this film.",2022-02-23
"I have been giving it a 1 star just because I can't give it a 0. This movie is a complete waste of time. The story is complete cringe and ending is so dumb,there is no logic in the story. Please I request you to not watchi this movie.Thankyou.",2022-02-26
I thought I had seen some bad movies but this is on a totally separate scale of horrible. This is by far and away the absolute worst piece of writing I have ever experienced. You could throw a can of alphabet soup at the wall and it would be 100 percent better than this screenplay. I think the writer has some serious issues with life in general.,2022-06-05
"Simply, this film is just another pitiful attempt at piggybacking on another classic horror film franchise with the addition of current social commentary. However there are a few positives to the film that deserve being mentioned. The film did do well on executing sounds and visual elements that helped create a great horror mood and look. But in my opinion , if you are looking to enjoy the best of the TTCM franchise, you can look no further than to start with the original. In subsequent to the original, I recommend the following:
1. TTCM 2
2. Leatherface: TTCM 3
3. TTCM (2003)
4. TTCM: The beginning
The rest are absolute trash.",2022-04-26
"Young influencers buy a run down Texas town and run into the legendary Leatherface who's been in hiding for close to 50 years.Although the gore quotient is high and the visuals are frequently beautiful, the story makes little sense and the characters are vapid and disposable, making it hard to root for them. If Leatherface is the most likable person in your film, you might want to reevaluate some things.",2022-02-20
"Halloween 2018 styled sequel that is entirely unnecessary but having realized how many cash grabs they've done seen the 2003 remake, well I wasn't expecting much beyond something to have a beer or two and pass the banality of dog sitting.Highly doubt I'd have bothered a review but the party bus scene has made this worth the view. 6/10, which is basically +1 (start all at neutral 5, most Netflix trash goes negative quick but again Party Bus, automatic +1)",2022-03-13

"A movie with a fine opening, the plot is been made to resemble other entries in the special way sequels are been done, the movie can be compared to the Babel, which is been halted as a result as a result of a divine intervention.The movie provides beautiful symbols and themes such as discussing issues of race and the confederate flag providing a beautiful introduction to the movie but everything falls short and collapses into violence and gore.It follows most of its predecessors in the franchise which are the killings perpetuated by Leather face the insanely violent murderer who doesn't seem to be killed, fans of this franchise would not be disappointed with this seamless display of violence.",2022-03-09
"Can I get my time back from watching this? Makes the first movie look like a masterpiece, while this one will be forgotten overnight. Trash. Acting was decent but the plot was probably written on a napkin. Racial garbage added, and so many goofs that it had me laughing. The gore was overdone for shock value. I'd say if you want to waste your time and feel cheated, go ahead and watch it for yourself. Better luck next time, Mr director.",2022-02-20
"Start of with the modern influencer BS vibe right from the start until the very end. The movie is just BAD, it tries to force itself as a worthy sequel even disregarding the other films just to ""fit in"". You won't be missing out if you won't watch this (or watch it if you wanna have a laugh). This ain't horror its comedy with a dash of gore.But I do like the part where they got killed, satisfying to say the least since this time they kinda deserved to get the chainsaw treatment in the guts.4/10 in my book. Gotta appreciate the visuals atleast.",2022-02-18
I was very excited for this movie but unfortunately it did not deliver.. could have been longer with a better story. The way they treated the poor lady in the start I was happy they died! Makes no sense. They could have done so much with this movie with Bering back Sally. It could been a great story but they had to ruin. The characters were annoying and not likeable at all and it didn't have much to the plot. I love how they brought back Sally but not the story. Let's hope someone tries again and actually watches the first movie so they can keep to a story that fits cause sadly this story didn't! Very poorly done movie.,2022-11-06
"Well, I enjoyed this reboot quite a bit, it's a great Saturday night movie; I can't understand why people are trashing it.I almost didn't bother to watch it because people were saying it was woke garbage. I don't care if it's woke as long as it's good, and this was good.That bus scene was cray. Like, come on, what more do you want as a horror fan? A completely over the top splatter fest, I think it's on par with the 2003 remake, and I think they are both superior to all the other TCM movies. The original is just tedious with all the screaming.TCM 2022 was one of the better horror films I've seen in a while, I enjoyed it more that Halloween Kills anyway.7.5/10.",2022-03-26
"I don't get why in every horror movie the cast has to be some of the dumbest people in the world. Some of their actions you could defend, but *SPOILER* leaving your sister, injured in a car, whilst chasing after a seemingly invincible chainsaw murderer, is just plain stupid.The film has a very few «scary» jumpscares, but that is it.Did not expect too much of this movie, and yet I was let down.",2022-02-18
I'm in middle of watching movie right now. They missed a huge chance to make awesome plot twist. They should have had leather face never leave the house. He should have killed everyone within the house. At the end they realize that the old lady and leather face actually still own the house. Which would mean he had every legal right to kill all the trespassers in his house. Yes it would be a stretch for that to be believable. It is Texas though so the castle law is in full effect. Would have been a real cool twist that they must definitely should have thought about.,2022-02-19
"I cannot even believe that I am wasting time writing about how bad this film is. This is an insult to human beings. First off, the police would never had taken an old sick lady in their police van not buckled up to a gurney, not realistic. Second, why would the girl go with them, doesn't make sense but maybe it is just a ""small town"" thing. If we get to the point where the movie could get just a little more believable, why would the girl keep her seat belt on after getting into the car accident, restraining herself from moving...the first thing I would have done would have been to grab the sheriff's gun to protect myself. There were so many things wrong with the plot but the next most frustrating thing was, was something wrong with the bus??? Why did the driver get off the bus? Everyone was trapped but they didn't even try to open the windows until later? There were so many opportunities for these characters to get away but they were too dumb. The next morning, there was an entire massacre and you still don't think to call 911? They didn't know the cops were killed. Everything about this was just done so lazy. Not worth the watch at all! I have seen some really bad horror films and I would say this was one of the worst.",2022-02-20

This is a meaningless scenario. Audiences no longer want this type of film. The Texas Massacre movie is already very well shot at the time. Netflix must make every movie even more meaningless !!! Congratulations to everyone who watched this time-wasting movie. I don't think it's worth wasting your time.",2022-05-19
"Because of the title and the genre, I give him 6 and take away 4 because of the unsympathetic actors. There are people who are not in front of the TV and the two brunettes are just like that. I'm just sorry they didn't kill them at the beginning of the movie. These creatures when you look at them and you can have nightmares.Once upon a time in horror movies, female characters were cute and / or beautiful, and you even regretted killing them in the movie. Here this element is totally absent. I'm even sure they won't be killed in the movie, because ""Death"" is afraid of these test tube creatures.",2022-02-21
"Everbody knew when the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre installment was announced that it wouldn't be some arthouse masterpiece and to no one's surprise this movie isn't.The characters are pretty weak. The return of Sally Hardesty is pretty pointless. The plot inciting incident is pretty stupid. This movie pretty much uses every cliche from the slasher genre playbook. You could go on and on here about the films weaknesses.BUT this film knows exactly what it is. A mindless and fun gore-fest. The kills are pretty good and brutal. It doesn't waste any time. The whole movie is basically watching an immortal Leatherface slaughtering GenZ Influencers and I'm all here for it. I mean common who doesn't want to see Leatherface throwing chainsaws or bashing a guys face in with a sledgehammer. In fact, Leatherface is so driven to kill all these teenagers that he survives being shot at multiple time by a shotgun, repeadtly stabbed and he even got a taste of his own medicine by being chainsawed at the end.If you're in for 75 minutes of non-stop gore and chainsaw action then you should watch this one.7/10.",2022-02-18

"As a massive fan of TCM I had to watch this. I must say I enjoyed the movie as a horror film, but it had too many flaws.Main one being tje actor they chose to play leather face is mid to late 40's.At this point 2022 leatherface would be 76 years old.His movements, speed, strength, agility ect would not be as they are in this movie. And this is a massive let down. The bus scene is a bit of joke, very hollywood. I feel TCM should be about the isolation and a hanfull of characters.I feel had this been a sequal but set, lets say the year 2000 or so then it would have worked better.But then again there are certain parts of the movie that would not of worked back then.Overall a lot more thought could have gone into it, I also feel an hoir and 20 mins is a bit cheap and rushed.That said I loved the last scene just before the credits roll.And just incase you missed it "" because netflix always cuts the credits short for trailers"" male sure you watch the post credits scene.",2022-02-24

Think Rob Zombie's Halloween intensity.",2022-02-18
"Movie was great, up there with the best TCM movie to date. Sure it has the woke yuppies in it but they are the bait, although the whole 50 years in hiding don't seem to make any sense.

Hope it gets some sequels.",2022-02-19

Go see it and enjoy.",2022-02-20
"I began watching this without any expectations. It could be just another TCM movie made for profit but it turned out to be pretty good!I really like that the original characters were mentioned.The movie is short, only about 1h23m but it was very intense as something happened almost all the time when the story got going. I really appreciate that they didn't use an overload of blood and gore to make the movie seem more scary, it never works for me when they do that.I do think there was a good story in TCM (2022), it even had an amazing line. At the gas station when Richter says "" See, we are plagued by feral hogs around these parts. The only way to deal with an invasive species, is to eradicate them, on sight"". Then you know the movie won't be bad.I only have a few things I would like to change, one is what happened to SH, I would have liked that to be different.The other thing and I do NOT say this to be racist! I DO NOT! But having dark skinned people killed in a bloody way, is a visual very bad idea.Usually in horror movies when something bad happens, it's mostly dark, like a forest, basement, room or somewhere dark and we all know that blood is naturally dark too, so having dark on dark on dark is a very bad effect that doesn't make a scene as terrifying as it could be. Again, I do NOT say this to be racist, it's a visual thing.The ending was incredible! I do hope thee could be a follow-up but only if it's well made!",2022-02-20

Keep that in mind.Predictably, mum dies and LF goes on his wild murderous rampage. Despite being shot at point blank range with a 12 caliber shotgun at least 4 times, stabbed, and after taking his own chainsaw (the worlds best chainsaw mind you that basically started right up after sitting in a wall for decades) to the face, LF endures...because he's basically Michael Myers at this point.Bad script, bad acting (even by horror movie standards) and a lame attempt to inject humor at the expense of ""wokism"" left this movie a complete disaster.

However, this addition to the franchise was entertaining and better than some of the other sequels.",2022-04-04
It has a couple very good scenes and gore. True terror is not present since it's all stylized and dumbed down for 13-year-olds who have Netflix on in the background while scrolling through TikTok 12 hours per day. Leatherface looks cool. The acting is terrible. There is a strange digital film grain that is uneven and looks like static. There is essentially no story. The audio mix is good. The ending is clever.,2022-02-20
"Finally a movie that shows how dumb the younger generation is, good laugh a lot slasher film. Pretty predictable, but not a bad time killer for a Netflix and chill kind of night. Trigger warning for Liberals lol.",2022-02-22
"Luckily, these horrible reviews of the movie had my bar so incredibly low, I walked away happy, if not laughing out how often I was yelling at the screen.The decisions and reasoning of the characters are AWFUL. They make no sense and I found myself yelling at the screen ""why is this happening"" more times than I think I may have ever before.If you can get over the truly absurd reactions by characters and the occasional woke moments, it is quite entertaining. It is shot very well and the main curly haired actress is honestly extremely good (I think she would shine in a better written role).Some of the deaths are truly great. Shot in super cool ways with great effects. I physically tensed over several death scenes.Without spoiling, I LOVED the ending. Like, loved the ending. Possibly one of my new favorite endings to a slasher movie, no exaggeration. Remember: this movie is not meant to be based in our firm reality - this is total fiction with fantastical things happening.If you can suspend your beliefs of wanting this to be totally realistic and take it at face value, you will have a genuinely good time with this movie.",2022-05-06
"It's hard to find a place to start on this one between the terribly casted actors to the writing as bad as that of a freshman in high school. With no build up nor signs of human feelings, there is no attachment to characters. It's clear through the majority of tasteless lackluster scenes, the writing and directing was absent minded on this one. From immediately starting a chainsaw that's been in a wall for 50 years, to stealing Jason's rising from dead out of the water ending, I'm not sure how this one ever got the budget. I'm certain the actors careers are dead after this one and the original creators of the Texas chainsaw would be appalled at how ridiculous this is. I'm hoping I missed where they said this movie is a spoof.",2022-02-22
"Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2022) is a film which pleasantly surprised me. I went into this film with little to no expectations. It seemed to me that the negative reviews had been written before the movie was released and to a certain degree made this project seem like a hopeless cause.However, this film surprisingly surpassed those expectations. Throughout its fairly short runtime, I was kept on the edge of my seat. The suspense was great, the gore was extreme, and I thought the overall storyline was very engaging.Despite garnering immediate harsh criticism for its ""desperate"" attempt to intrigue a new audience, I felt like the way in which they did so wasn't too on the nose or distracting.Leatherface is brutal as always, and Mark Burnham was great casting. He perfectly captured the ruthlessness of Leatherface that wouldn't make it a Chainsaw Massacre film without. Other than Leatherface, the other characters served their purpose and I felt an attachment to nearly all of them.However, this film shines the most with its cinematography. There are countless very artistically driven shots that I wasn't expecting to see in this type of movie. It baffles me how people aren't noticing aspects of the film like this. The film's use of colour palette makes it stand out significantly from the rest of the franchise, and it gave me psychedelic horror vibes.While I was impressed by the film, its inclusion of Sally Hardesty felt cheap and unnecessary. Bringing back original characters can either go to ways. They can be used to bring new life into a franchise while still keeping its roots, or it can be a lazy way to connect a seemingly unconnected story to the original. Unfortunately, it is the latter in this case.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, and prefer it over a lot of the franchise. It was enjoyable from start to finish, and it didn't have me rolling my eyes, yawning, or dozing off at any instance. I understand this film isn't for anything, but if you go into it hoping to enjoy a decent slasher, you might just be satisfied.",2022-02-19
Worth a watch if you're a fan of the series but if you're looking for horror this might not be the best choice. Campy and at times silly but it's watchable and fun.,2022-04-24
"This movie is ridiculous disliked the way it ended i could use more harsh words because it was that horrible DONT RECOMMEND, producers who made this movie should not make any more of these movies quit your job .",2022-02-22
"If you are into gore this movie probably won't dissapoint you. Otherwise it's just weak. Characters barley exist and basically don't have any development not even mentioning the amount of stupid decisions made by them. The Plot is pretty much non existent, with no real buildup, suspense or anything that makes a a good horror story work.Its extremley jumscare reliant, where the same kind of ""scares"" are repeated over and over and over.Some kills are pretty fun tho and if you just want to watch a dumb horror movies with some friends and beers it should work perfectly because there is pretty much no downtime in the movie.Thats the only reason why i even rate this movie 5 Stars.",2022-02-22
As a huge texas chainsaw massacre fan and seeing all the remakes i'd have to say this one was pretty cool. Good gore. Brought the survivor into it and i thought that was a unique idea.,2022-02-23

"This new entry tries a bit but misunderstands what works about the original and disappoints by following the latest ""Halloween"" formula: bring back a main character, skip sequels, and put in dozens of kills performed by a 70 year old. The kills start 20 minutes in and don't stop for 1 hour. It is too much, with too many dumb decisions, excessive requirement of suspension of belief, qnd Leatherface acting more like Jason.I'm a fan of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and even had a chance to meet Tobe Hooper and hear from him what went into the original. There was a build up of suspense created by the side characters, strange house, and a few shocking kils. The 3rd one (with Viggo Mortensen!) ratched up the chainsaw action and kills, but rather kept the formula. The wonderfully weird 4th one went back to the black comedy and tension by creepy side characters (Matthew McConaughey!), but the low budget showed, and people were disappointed with the lack of chainsaw kills. Then the prequels came, keeping the formula but making the gore and repulsion far stronger. The odd long-delayed 4th sequel with Alessandra Daddario went all over the place with mixed results.Here the formula is tossed after a few minutes, ,with no suspense, a focus on spoofing gentrification and Gen Z/later Milennial culture. There are some good shots, one interesting exchange of dialogue (about surviving school shootings), and not much more. It's all kill, kill .kill, kill, all shot too cleanly.",2022-02-19
"It feels like no effort was put into this movie.Some say it is a slasher movie and so it doesn't need to make sense, but I think a slasher should be realistic.",2022-02-22
"So this was meant to be a direct sequel to the classic original??? Yikes! Nothing but a gore filled made for TV movie and thats being generous. Characters were horrible, no back story from the past 40+ years, horrible script and acting but you cant blame the young actors for trying.",2022-06-15
"This movies was not horrible but also not good, the only thing that I really enjoyed was GORE and kills, which was many of it in this movie, and the bus scene was awesome, the rest really weak and forgettable.Week story and characters, bunch of smug teens with teslas and smart phones in there hands ...",2022-02-22
"If you don't like too much violence, blood and that kind of slasher stuff in movies you're going to think this is just pointless and weird. Which is not weird at all, because then this is not for you... Can't really get anymore clearer than that.But if you do however like a movie filled with dark horror scenes, tension, even some comedy sometimes and that typical slasher stuff this is for you. So if you think you can stomach this and want to give it a go I suggest reading up on Ed Gein, then you'll understand the scenes much more.Also don't show this to anyone under 18, you got to be old enough to understand that it's really just a movie to be able to enjoy it properly.",2022-03-27
"This movie is a 7 for me purely because I liked the frequent and creative kills leather face delivered. It is essential for a horror movie like this to contain bloodshed and violence. However, I didn't like most of the characters in the story because they were all so stupid and got themselves killed. When trying to defeat a chainsaw-wielding lunatic, one does not simply hit him with the butt of a gun, or attempt to run him over, but fail miserably and die as a result. Anyways, I found the ending quite amusing as it was funny to watch a bunch of moronic women attempt to kill leatherface. Overall, not a must see, but not bad either.",2023-02-14
"The movie and the plot had a lot of potential and they have ruined it, they literally introduced a character and after 5 minutes they had already killed him. The end? Horrible, pointless, surreal.",2022-02-18

"I have always viewed the TCM movies as comedy at best. This movie was good for some laughs. Not the best acting, but again, its a comedy that was originally meant to be a horror.There is a scene halfway through or so where Leatherface takes out a bus full of ""influencers"". It was so enjoyable and gratifying to watch. I say Leatherface for Prez2024!Finally, this movie tried the same script as Halloween 2018. Laurie Stroud is back, this time to kill Leatherface (like Mike Myers, she fails again).I recommend this movie if your looking to laugh.",2022-03-07
"This movie was rather interesting, and was indeed worth the watch.It isn't perfect, nor top tier, but I found it rather good. However it will never compare to the original.Without a doubt, watch this movie if you love horror and gore - and a wild ride of emotions.",2022-02-26

"The rollout of this new movie has been abysmal, and so has the critical reception. However, I think this movie will fare much better with age, as it's an edge of your seat thrill ride.No sequel in this series has been able to replicate the social commentary, Americana, and sheer terror of the original. This one gets 2/3, failing on the social commentary front. But when it comes to that dusky Americana Hooper trademarked all those years ago, as well as the edge-of-your-seat action, this one nails it.Give this one a chance knowing that you really only have to wait 15min or so until the mayhem ensues.",2022-02-19
"Between the bad acting and awful plot, this was hard to watch the entire way through. Having Sonny and Rizzo from Grease's daughter as the main wasn't the only reason it was so bad.

"Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2022 is a solid entry to the franchise. The gore is awesome and realistic, Leatherface is brutal and terrifying. The characters are unlikable at first (spoiled rich kids), but they get better and we actually start to root for them. You should watch the 1974 movie to really feel the return of Sally. The movie is fast paced, which is a good quality. Leatherface's family is missing. Some characters decisions are a bit stupid. Worth watching, 8/10.",2022-02-18

The one thing I loved about this horror movie is I actually wanted every single character to die except leather face. The older sister was dreadful. I wanted her to die in the first 10 minutes. Of course the woke demon raised its head. Don't know when Hollywood will get the clue. We watch movies to escape not hear and see what we already hear and see on the news and social media daily. Overall though it's a decent popcorn movie. Had what a horror movie is suppose to have. Kills and thrills. I will say if you like someone to cheer for outside of the killer then you'll be disappointed. They're all annoying except the richter character. So you want them to die in the worst ways possible. That's where this movie succeeds big time and why we stayed with it. It's a homely looking cast too lol.,2022-02-19
"A bunch of snobby, entitled, liberal snowflakes rudely enter someone else's town and starts trouble and then acts surprised with it backfires on them. What more can you ask for? I went to a university for four years and had to deal with kids just like these every day in every class and trust me when I say it was brutal. This film is such a satisfying experience for me because for once Leatherface, at least in my opinion, is just defending his home. I'm also from Texas and was glad these Texans stood their ground. These kids asked for trouble. They should have stayed home in their own town. The first thing they do is criticize someone for carrying a gun. Well then stay out of Texas! I think the previews and the reviews are a bit misleading. It's not as bad as it seems.",2023-07-20

"I think it's best to go into this movie with little to no expectations. Some of the action scenes were brutal but at the same time I found myself almost cheering them! Having read some of the other reviews, I think the scores have been incredibly harsh and that's coming from someone who's pretty critical of most things I watch. I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would but it's probably because I knew it wasn't exactly going to be an Oscar winner in the first place.",2022-02-19

Another one of these movies i went in with low expectations for but came out a believer. Some young people go to a town in the middle of nowhere to transform it into a resort town. They move leatherface and his mother out of a tenement and things go haywire. There are two points about this movie. Its not in any way spooky so if youre watching it for that you will be left underwhelmed and a bit disappointed. If you are watching it for the kills then this movie delivers in spades. There are plenty of gory kills to keep most gorehounds happy. Maybe its not quite on par with the classic 2003 release but its still a pretty good follow up. It could have been so much worse than the reviews would lead you to believe.,2022-03-22

"Netflix should have known better than to release this hot steaming pile of garbage. There is no doubt in my mind that no character in this film would be able to even tie their own shoe laces. They are such an incompetent cast of fools who would struggle to figure out how to take a rubix cube out of the box, never mind solve it. This film borrows from much better horror films more than it comes up with original ideas and there is little problem in suggesting that if you replaced Leather Face with Michael Myers, Sally with Jaime Lee Curtis and the young hip millennials with some raunchy teens and called it Halloween's Vacation no one would bat an eye, apart from those who complain it is too much like the other Halloween movies.",2022-03-08
It's wasn't the worst film in the franchise and has some really entertaining set pieces. The special effects and Cinematography are also great too. It really is the writing that's the biggest issue.,2022-04-03
"It's not as bad as the reviews, to me anyway. But one thing what annoyed me was the bit where the young adults got there phones out to video Leatherface and said ""try anything you're cancelled bro"". Wasn't necessary to have the stupid kids of today talking and doing utter b****ks in what could've been a great movie. Other than that I thought it was good. No where as good as the original but good.",2022-07-06
"Just finished watching the film. They decided to take Sally from the older films and make her into a throw away bait character. Painfully obvious references to ""white people bad"", cancel culture, poor character development and more. You can't really care for anyone in this film because they have 0 information. Only thing you know is ones a shooting survivor.It had an okay start but slowly fell into a dumpster fire. Its like nobody had any actual sense of survival. Either they stand around or wait when the killers next to them and die. Nobody ever says anything about the danger, everyone in this film is just a throw away. They didn't even BOTHER to make anything of Sally.If you said it was just a random sheriff, you'd never know it was her. They tried to clearly copy Halloweens plot basically. Sally felt like a Laurie clone. They were acting like Michael myers was leatherface. It just was another said remake with awful characters. Hope no more remakes for Horror classics. If they do, god please stop doing this!",2022-03-31
"Had zero expectations going in to this one. But it sure delivered. Being short and sweet was this movie's success! No need for unnecessary plot lines and drama just straight to the tension.

"I quite liked the movie. Decent bit of gore and a few nods to the original. Think a certain character got killed off too soon and would of made a better ending.Trust me, there's a lot worse films out there! Out of the franchise I'd place this in 4th (how many is there.....9?)Anyways, you can't take these films seriously so don't go looking for the ultimate horror experience. Enjoy it for what it is. People are way too harsh and expect way too much......you can't keep everyone happy!",2022-02-20
"You start watching the movie and you already set yourself up for something very bad, but I'm looking forward to seeing Bubba, so no matter how stereotypical the main characters look and you already know who will survive at the end from the first minutes of the movie, it doesn't matter. As a result, what I see is some kind of huge man who, from his first appearance, it was clear that he had problems with sociality, he sits at home and struggles with his thoughts about how to cut people. Later we learn that this guy is not so simple, he did not waste his time in vain and by 2022 he learned how to wield his saw so cool that any worker from Canada would envy him. But everything, of course, slides into a rather boring massacre and our heroine leaves for the sunset making a very fat hint at the continuation of this dead franchise.Worst horror and good slasher.",2022-05-06

"Personally Texas Chainsaw is one of my favorite slasher franchises, but this movie just doesn't do it justice. As many other people have stated, the cast is predominantly annoying and insufferable young adults. The bus scene was supposed to be a suspenseful and gory moment for the movie, but the lackluster dialogue that led up to it just made the whole scene feel gross. Saying ""I'm gonna cancel you"" to a man carrying a chainsaw covered in blood, just feels goofy and unrealistic. This movie has especially bad dialogue and terrible delivery. Another scene that especially irked me was in the end when the car is driving away and she is snatched from the car. Her sister is helplessly trapped in a slow self driving car just being sheepishly carried away. Overall the movie was ok at best and cringy dialogue plagued the film.",2022-12-09
"I am always hesitant to watch a Netflix movie. But I am certainly glad I watched this one. I am not a huge fan of the Texas chainsaw massacre but, I do like the original, the 2003 remake, and the beginning. I have seen the other ones but I never thought they were very good. This one has some of the common horror movie ""annoyances"" but, I thought it had a original premise witch is a big plus. I thought the main actors did a good job. And I like the idea of the surviving girl from the original coming back Laurie strode style to do battle with leather face. A lot of brutal and creative kills i.e. The bus scene. That was fun. I think the movie kind of pokes fun at liberals but did a good job not to truly mock anybody on either side. The ending was actually surprising and brutal and definitely left me with a dreadful type of feeling. It's rare that a movie can do that to a seasoned horror fan. All in all this movie is definitely worth the watch. Hopefully Netflix can come out with more fun films like this.",2022-03-06

"If you've seen the other iterations of this franchise, you don't need to see this one. The main characters are extremely unlikeable, but teens today are despicable so I guess the portrayal is accurate. It has the idea of bringing the sole surviving character of the original, yet she brought nothing to the table other than being stupid. The ending is predictable. It's the same ending as one of the previous installments! That's just lazy writing. The gory is good though, which is why I gave it a 4. Overall a forgettable installment.",2022-02-20
Like the recent reboot of Halloween this aims to be a true sequel to the original. Maybe trying to forget the other attempts at sequels in between ever happened ?Digging up an original character who has suffered her ordeal for decades and wants revenge is another idea stolen from Halloween's reboot.This is just another predictable teens in peril run of the mill horror film that we have all more or less seen before.But I still found it a pretty tense watch. I've seen so many movies in the same genre that just don't come close to scaring or shocking me anymore.But something about this did !!I found it quite gut wrenching at times and the brutality felt pretty real at times.The special effects were good. The sound editing added a creepy atmosphere. And most of the actors did a decent job with an average script.I've gave it a 6 because I can see how a lot of people will think this is the same old same old seen it all before movie.But I felt it's runtime was about perfect and it had enough going for it to give hardened horror fans a decent nights viewing.I felt this movie tried to take the franchise in a slightly different direction which wasn't a bad thing although the final scene of the movie maybe let's that theory down a bit.Overall I'd say it's a worthy addition to the Texas chainsaw franchise.Remembering what genre of movie this is and if your a fan of this type of movie it's worth a watch.6 out of 10.,2022-02-18

"Started off strong, it had potential with some thriller elements and a high budget cinematic feel but very quickly declined with no character development or connection to the characters, stupid modernism with the Tesla and social media, and the worst possible ending. I tried to overlook the unrealistic deaths like how Sally was dangling in the air from a chainsaw and somehow lived to still shoot her gun. The writers should have taken into consideration that it is counterintuitive to make it seem like it makes sense to make killing him the focal point of the movie as if it is not human nature to try and survive a killer instead. Just overall plenty of dumb decisions constantly met. You go from fearing for these characters to comically cheering on their deaths. As far as the ending, it would have been way better if they showed the killer still alive in some way instead of that last minute, rushed, senseless kill of one of the main characters.",2022-10-09
"I see a lot of reviewers doing the usual 'bad film' 'bad script' da da da.However, the talent behind this is the writer/director from Don't Breathe and Evil Dead (2013) (Fede Alvarez) - he wrote and produced this film.At the end of the day this won't win any awards or have 'character development'. What it does do is creatively kill off most of the dumb teens or millennials portrayed in the movie.Yes, the script does what it does, the younger actor do their bit, but are just waiting to get sliced because of silly situations.The soundtrack score is solid, which appears to utilize a Leatherface theme (the droning music, with the chainsaw), there's a nice piece of surprising instrumental at the end credits which closes out the film with heavy techno synth like sound (composed by saxophonist Colin Stetson).The horror, violence/gore were well done; Leatherface coming out of the dark alleyway in one scene, the short but slightly stylized action of Leatherface and the local mechanic going toe to toe (hammer to gun?) was very well done and edited so you can see what's going on. The CGI is minimal and enhances the practical effects used.The millennials on the bus getting mowed down like grass was satisfying.Getting the original actress back was decent enough, including the photo used from the original film still and the opening credits which helped to bridge the original with this one.6/10 because it sets out what it needs to do, create a situation/situations for people to get killed off (creative kills) and the practical effects team providing the necessary. The script could have been tightened a bit more, but can you complain for a film that runs at 81mins? Compared to these recent films that have 2hr + runtimes.The other sequels after the original aren't that great, this is much better without oversized budget and the fat trimmed e.g. No real pacing issues.Note - there's a small end credits scene, so watch to the end.",2022-02-19
This movie was OK. There were some really entertaining kill scenes and there was good suspense but this wasn't nearly as good as the other texas chainsaws. Another thing this movie did that I didn't like was how they did not really develop the characters. If you are like me and you enjoy when horror movies have devastating endings you will like this one. I also wished this movie would be a littl bit longer as it was only about 1:20 minutes. Overall i did not hate this movie but it definitely won't be a memorable movie or anything. I would watch this for the credits but its nothing special. 5/10.,2022-11-25
"I saw this film recently and am amazed that it was allowed to be released.A group of self entitled, whiney, millennials stomp around just looking to pick an argument with everyone they meet. Of course, there's a sad backstory to one of them that tries to tie in modern takes on guns and schools but you just don't feel sorry for any of them.The poor chainsaw wielder is the one to feel sorry for here, having his home town invaded by these live streaming, wannabes and having to put up with them before he finally gets to kill some. And just when you think it can't get worse they drag someone in from the original film who seems to have spent 40 or 50 years plotting revenge. Makes me feel sorry for the chainsaw.",2023-10-29
Right from the beginning you can't wait to see leather face where Melodys face she's atrocious. Overall overall the movie was a fun watch blood and gore iis exactly what you get.,2022-03-09
"This is one of the most infuriating movies I have ever seen in my entire life. At every opportunity, characters make the DUMBEST decisions they can. I know it's a horror movie, and that's a common trope that is used to progress the movie and put characters in dangerous situations, but it was horrible. It completely took me out of the movie. I really wish I didn't start this movie in the first place, and I only really finished it all the way through out of hate and spite. You couldn't pay me enough to watch it again. I was rooting against ALL the characters except for the killer because of all the stupid and nonsensical things they did. I absolutely hated it. 1 star is too high.",2023-03-21
"I watched this movie about 4 times and not because I liked it. Nothing made sense and I was just trying to understand it. But now that I finally get the point and stuff I realize how rushed the entire story is and even worse the entire writing was a complete mess and honestly made no sense. I didn't understand anything and everything was just completely random in a sense. The entire movie was so confusing and then in the end Sally returns after all these years and that's the point? It was pretty boring, confusing and really was a crappy movie. There was absolutely no reason they made this aside from just for money or it was just severely rushed and nobody put time and effort into the writing.",2023-08-18
"I went in thinking this movie was going to be a cheesy add to the franchise, I was wrong. Kept me entertained the whole way through. Perfect ending for a horror movie!!!",2022-02-21
"If you are in for the gore this is probably the best TCM movie of all , if you are in for the story don't even bother to watch it , probably one of the worst in that field.The movie is brutal, gore galore, has tension, leatherface is at his best as a brutal mean killing machine , the movie is pretty entertaining.Long story short: if you want a good story, we'll scripted movie with character development definitely skip this one but if you are in just for pretty dumb entertainment and for the gore you need to watch it, I had a blast!!!!",2022-02-18
"I see a lot of reviews complaining that the movie did not live up to, what I can only imagine was, a very good original. While living under my rock, I never watched any of the older films, so saw this without any expectations. What I found was a flawed and fun film, something that made me interested to see the orginal(s).",2022-02-23
"Waste of time! The movie is a slaughter, bad written, bad acting. And i have to write 150 to get this done for others to see. It is a stupid plot....................................................................................... ..........",2022-02-20
"Leatherface owned it this time. The rest of them were just props! The cowboy was promising, until he wasn't. Watching these millennials act is so painful! Why do they make actors act so disrespectful and entitled that I couldn't have cared less to what happens to them. The blood and gore was there but the plot and acting were weak and stupid.. I thought they would make people act smarter in movies now, not make stupid mistakes as driving so slowly or the classic, I want to walk off on my own in a weird ghost town. Move along now, there's clearly nothing to see here unless you want to scroll your phone throughout the movie.",2022-03-08
"Riding off of the success of Halloween (2018) and Halloween Kills (2021), horror fans are given yet another TCM sequel. Speaking of Halloween, this may as well be a worse version of Halloween (2018), but with Leatherface instead of Michael Myers. A new group of young, zoomer entrepreneurs are chased around by Leatherface with the help from a country-hick contractor and the elderly Laurie Str-- I mean Sally Hardesty, the survivor of the Original TCM in 1974, who is hunting down the last Sawyer with a vengeance.As a stand alone film, TCM (2022) has a few eye rolling moments, and a few character decisions that make you exclaim ""oh come on"" through your breath, but is a generally captivating watch. There is some nice cinematography, and some some genuinely surprising moments. I could've done without the ending, as it seemed a little forced, but throughout, fairly enjoyable.As a TCM sequel, this film is light-years ahead of some of it's recent predecessors. After binge-watching all of the TCM franchise, this film is a breath of fresh air. The characters aren't cartoonishly over-the-top, and the action is interesting. Unlike the few films before this, the film is visually compelling instead of just looking grey and drab. This movie isn't as scary or as visceral as the Original, but it does have buckets and buckets of gore, if that's something you're into. I do miss the dark comedy that the Original 1974 TCM (and 86) brought through with the interactions of the Sawyer family, but I'll settle for this I guess.Overall, a little derivative of the recent Halloween films and contains a few cringey moments, but well worth seeing if you like gore or TCM.",2022-02-22
This was a great idea but poorly executed. Good special effects but the acting was horrible. They tried to make too reliable to Millennials and that's what ruined it.,2022-02-26
"This movie had a lot going for it except for a decent script. Granted, this may or may not be the writer's fault as directors and producers can always negatively affect the script also, maybe to save some cash, maybe for visual flair. I just don't get why studios and production companies are so willing to throw money (this thing is alleged to have cost $20 million) at projects with such terrible, lazy, moronic scripts. It frustrates me because it makes me believe that these filmmakers think that if you simply throw enough eye candy at an audience they'll ignore or forget how stupid the story is. From a technical point of view, there's very little to complain about. Even the acting is more than passable. I'm not gonna blame the actors for poor character development though; again, that's the writer's job from the outset. Alas, it's another horror film that relies upon characters doing the dumbest things at the worst times in order to setup some cheap scares. It's all so trite, rehashed, predictable, and boring. In all, it was a fun one-time watch but nothing to dwell on or revisit in the future.",2022-02-18
"Such a bad movie, I had to stop within the first 30 minutes because every 2 minutes something was politicized. What has happened with this soft PC country? Such a joke.",2022-02-22
I won't waste my time writing this review like I did watching this movie. If I could rate it in the negatives I would. A total abomination of a movie and a disservice to the namesake.,2022-02-20
"Bad acting , bad storyline. No one put enough effort to make the movie good. They just used the name
of the originals to make some money. Shame on you.",2022-02-20
"To tell you the truth, I thought this movie was a VERY VERY GOOD one, and I was on the edge of my seat with excitement. I thought it was a worthy successor. I think most here who are posting reviews have turned nagging into a hobby. It's 2022, not 1974 anymore. This movie gets 10 stars from me.",2022-02-24
"It was perfectly gory, but the characters were so annoying. So annoying that I didn't even care when they were killed off, nor did I root for them.Besides that it wasn't bad.",2022-02-22
"Almost everything that made the original TCM great is lacking in this... all that remains is the gore. Would have really liked to have enjoyed this, but there was really nothing there to enjoy. Pacing was bad, no real character development... just... bad. AT LEAST it was short?",2022-02-21

"What an absolute s... show this film is, waste of 74 minutes of your life unless you watch the credits to make it a bit longer, how they got the go ahead to make this nonsense is beyond me, surely after all the sequels that have been made they could of come up with something better than this. Have no words beside total load of rubbish.",2022-04-26
You could've name it differently I mean yes... is a movie about a dude that kills some other young people. But it has nothing to do with TCM. But I mean sure if you want to watch some nonsense violence it is entertaining for a while just... don't expect anything else.,2022-02-25
Never before have I been so disappointed in a movie that I have actually taken the time to write a review to warn others against wasting theirs. Avid horror movie fan since the late 80's. I have sat through my fair share of eye rolling additions to horror legacies but none before have been this horrible. Not even laughably bad. A decent premise completely wasted on bad writing. No tension. No character building. Horrible Gen Z and poor southern stereotypes completely devoid of reality. Just and all around disappointment. I truly feel bad for the actors that signed on for this movie as they were as let down by the final product as I was.,2022-02-25
"I give it 2 stars for the special effects alone. Apart from the named link with Leatherface and TCM, it is just another lame attempt at horror with zero scares. Where are the scares in films nowadays? Gore just isn't frightening. Gore doesn't make you jump out of your seat. There is no horror here, just the odd bit of gore.Sadly, this is just another pathetic ""bunch of teenagers on a road trip get killed"" movie with nothing of interest in between and one of horrors most iconic characters wheel out of retirement for a Netflix payday.Garbage!",2022-02-21
"Finally a step in the right direction in this delicious, heart warming, delightful movie. I hope this is the start of a new trend. Lets stop making movies, remaking movies or ruining franchises with hidden social messages - lets just have out-right horror - or action or drama.. I was so moved and so happy with this movie I laughed, I cried, a brilliant horror all the way through and a perfect ending. YES! Thank you God!",2022-02-22
"Pretty unwise plot for the sake of keeping the movie going. Silly reasons to get killed. Poor acting, kind of low
budget. Did not scare instead made me slap my forehead and say 'how poor' An insult to the previous prequels.I wish they would have consulted some high school and some university student as they are their biggest market. Even they would be bored. A ychologistbshoild has been consulted.",2022-03-21
"Not sure about all the harsh reviews on here, but it was much better than I expected. I didn't go in with much hope but was pleasantly surprised. I think the first half is better, because the usual dumb decisions characters make in horror films start to come up towards the end. As others have said, I didn't care for any of the characters, and wanted Leatherface to get revenge. The film did a good job of gaining sympathy for his character, which was actually well done. It's definitely worth a watch and quite entertaining.",2022-02-18
"I'd been following the production of this film from when it was announced because I was interested by the handicapped lead storyline. At some point this IMDB page completely changed the summary and removed many ""trivia"" items that seemed to confirm what the new summary had: this movie was actually not going to have any disabled characters in it after all. Not surprising but very disappointing as the horror genre could only benefit from raising the stakes (in whatever creative way)- including disabled characters in horror would really raise the stakes for me! Could not finish it I was so bored. Not worth your time, watching one of the other ""reboots"" is a better waste.",2022-02-19
"Ok. So it's GORE GORE GORE awesome special effects. The plot is predictable, acting ok, but it was suspenseful. You will either like it or hate it. It was a good spin though of the original, making it modern with cell phones, etc.",2022-02-20
"The plot was extremely terrible**SpoilersShe could have kill leather face instead she decided to have a small chat and not pulled the trigger
Yeah what a revenger.",2022-02-22
If you don't expect too much and want to watch decent slasher than this is the movie for you. Far from the best in the franchise but it's fun. I wouldn't recommend watching it by yourself because I could see it getting boring. Instead get some popcorn and a friend or two and have fun yelling at the characters to pick a better hiding spot.,2022-02-21
"Killing annoying liberals? I actually should give this movie a 10 😂 but when you can't stand the characters you're supposed to be rooting for and every decision every person makes it the movie is absolutely stupid, you can't stand to watch it. I had it at 1 but I will move it to 2 because the gorey chainsaw killings looked awesome. But other than that stupid movie, stupid ending, I had no problem with the Texas chainsaw massacre himself until he had a weird stupid swinging dance right at the end. Looked like an idiot 😂 and all this build up for the chick who survived, she totally gets messed up and is a complete idiot. Anyways again bad movie made by annoying liberals.",2022-02-20
"A very welcome addition to the Texas Chainsaw Franchise, Well edited, for a film that's just over 2hrs it is very fast paced. As someone who's seen the original and the remake of early 2000s, this is Leatherface at his most savage, he really is the main attraction and he makes the whole thing entertaining. Only flaws in this in my opinion I would have to say the acting from the other main characters felt a little flat. Overall this is a solid 9/10.Non spoiler:: stick around for the end credit scene there is only one right at the end of the film:).",2022-02-18
"This must have been the worst film I've seen in a long time.There was absolutely nothing to enjoy about this. Leatherface is a horror icon, yet in this film they didn't do him any justice. Terribly poor attempt in so many ways. The closer to the ending it was, the worse this movie got, to the point of actual disbelief.Do not watch this, especially if you're a fan of earlier Leatherfce films. Actually, just don't watch this, no matter what.",2022-05-08
One of the worst movies I've seen in a while. The decisions made in this movie were horrible and got a lot of people killed. Can't someone make a good horror without making the protagonist complete idiots? I don't typically watch gore and maybe this is why. It sucked in my opinion.,2022-02-20
The whole movie is good. However an old lady will show up in the movie with cowboy hat and will destroy the whole movie. Otherwise was pretty good before that.,2022-02-19
"Just a chick flick vengeance slasher... i got nothing more to say than girl power yet again... i think the spice girls have taken over horror... it was held okay then it got stupid. Should have had hardesty in the film longer. I would recommend the texas chainsaw massacre '03 and chainsaw massacre: the beginning uncut for the better experience. This new one is fine but it got absolutely stupid the same way scream 4 was... oh it was a absolute joke when it came to a cellular phone against a chainsaw. That absolutely ruined it for me. Then that piece of garbage electric car right at the end. And also the city kids digging at their elders for polluting the world, really... could we get anything more childish than that... but aside from that the film was heavily stupid. Most of the elements were stolen from the 03 and 06 films to flesh out a continuity from the first and original texas chainsaw massacre... oh could the car drive any slower? Pft, e-cars suck on auto drive according to this film.",2022-02-22

"So many problems with this movie. Im not sure how a person can take a chainsaw threw the gut, have a chains rev threw there body and still have the ability to shoot and reload a shotgun. The fact that it most likely severed her spin making physically impossible for this person to move makes me feel like i was watching a cartoon.Not much to brag. Enjoyed the killing outside of that not much to talk about.",2022-02-19
"These kids were entitled, annoying, privileged, social-media driven individuals for whom I did not feel remorse for while they were being mutilated. And, of course, of the 4 main characters, the black guy dies.",2022-02-20
"I wasn't expecting much since the film franchise died after its last successful installation with ""the beginning."" Still, what we got was a badly written gore-fest. The acting was awful, the violence was unbelievable and forced, and the characters were just the worst; however the worst part 9f the film was the ill-attempted social commentary that most often fell flat, and contributed nothing to the actual story. The movie is at best redundant, unnecessary, and truly proves this film series needs to be put to rest. The texas chainsaw was scary because of leatherface AND his family, trying to create some sort of sentiment behind his actions just takes away from the original story entirely. Only giving it two stars because admittedly the knee break scene was pretty brutal. Aside from that, save yourself an hour and half and go do literally anything else, I promise you'll enjoy whatever you decide to do more.",2022-02-28

"If I could give this movie zero I would. Nothing scary about it, no build up suspense, no character development, no plot just gore.It seemed like they tried to copy the halloween reboot but half through decided against it. Considering how iconic and ground breaking the original movie was, this is just another sequel you can throw in the bin.Just a shocking movie.",2022-02-27
"Mild spoilers. OK so they bring back Sally and she's useless. Leatherface is somehow healthy as a 20 year old bodybuilder. But hey it's a slasher. It's got what slashers need, dumb annoying people being killed. At least the victims weren't tropes, not sex crazed, boozy, stoner, teenagers but instead influencers. Way better. And the gore effects were pretty darn good. Watch this with some friends with a few beers. Turn off your brain. Some nice nods to other movies too: The Shining, Halloween, the original Chain Saw Massacre especially the ending shot. It's a watchable slasher that does what it's supposed to do.",2022-08-11
"No reason for a long book. If u like slashers and love Leatherface watch this ASAP. The new Texas Chainsaw has everything u could ask for. Lots of Leatherface, lots of blood(even tho 1st had barely any), lots of kills, and a whole lot of Chainsaw action with some sledgehammer thrown in. Big big thumbs up. Its hard to beat the 1st 3 Chainsaws and even the 2003 remake but this 1 is a great addition. Long live Leatherface. Gladly own the bluray once its released. I want another 1. Bring it on.",2022-02-18

"Watch this movie only for 2 reasons: one, if you love gore and 2, if you got time to kill. This movie is kind of made well, not cheap and cheesy slasher flick, but doesn't match the intensity and seriousness of Halloween 2018 which is also directly connected to the 70s original. Surprisingly, I really liked the acting of the lead actress, she really did the best she could. It's not great and it's not bad, as I said, only if you have time.",2022-03-21
Saying this is the worst movie ever would be an understatement. Let the classics die classics pls!! It's so dumb and goofy. I gave it 2 only because it made me laugh at how goofy it is.,2022-03-11
"When LF gets worked up you cheer for him and at the types of people he kills.

"This is not a brain teaser or has any deep meaning. It's a movie with violence, gore, blood, etc., etc. And that is exactly what it delivered. Hence the reason for a high rating.",2022-03-11
"I'm not sure why this movie is getting so much hate. I've never written an IMDb review before, but I felt the need to give this movie some love. Was it cheesy at some points? Sure. Could the ending have been less cliche'? Sure. But what more could you expect for an American horror movie in 2022 that's part of a storied franchise? I honestly thought that up until the 57min mark that it was pure brilliance, then it wrapped itself up with an awkward and convenient Hollywood bow.Story: B
The story was good, and it fit within the narrative of the franchise arc. It was a fresh storyline, if you think about it. There aren't many original storylines left to take these days, and I think this movie was able to pull one off. I think some people who didn't like this movie may be getting hung up on this theme of political correctness. If anything, the movie was more about depicting ""balance"". A couple of characters with anti-gun sentiments (understandably based on their backstories), but ultimately needing one to survive. Characters wanting a confederate flag taken down, but the owner of the flag explaining why it means so much to them. Young people gentrifying a 'ghost town', but the locals understanding change is a part of life. Even though the locals don't like it, they respect the law and provide support. Balance. Bringing back one of the original cast members was initially working out well, but then I felt that unraveled toward the end.Script: B
The dialogue was good; realistic. Nothing too sensational, nothing too cliche', nothing that unrealistic in context.Acting: A-
The acting was actually good... especially for a horror movie. Nothing too over the top. Nothing too monotonous. Yes, some actors were better than others.Cinematography: A
This was VERY well shot and looked great.Gore: A+
You won't be disappointed. Great effects. Great kills.Horror Purity: B-
Is it a 'classic' horror movie? No. I'm a horror purist... but I appreciate being entertained by elements of the genre. Is it scary? Not really (especially if you're desensitized to the genre). Is it thrilling? Absolutely. Is it entertaining? Yes. Does it make you scared to visit a Texas ghost town? Not at all.Again, for what these filmmakers and cast were trying to do, I thought the execution was very well done. When you look at the film ""Leatherface"" as the beginning... the original ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" as the middle... and this ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" as the new end (for now)... it really does work well.Hope this helped!",2022-02-19
"Pretty decent horror. Nothing like the originals, but I wasn't expecting it to be. Good effects and decent acting. I enjoyed how they added a different story but kept the theme. Dolby Atmos sounds excellent too!",2022-02-21
"Long story short. Bad script, bad acting, virtually no character development, a woke attempt but unfortunately overall waste of time. The only thing it had going for it was the gore and effects and even then it wasn't very redeeming. Save yourself the disappointment and just watch the original again.",2022-02-20
"This version is the worst one. Just basic slaughter. Makes no sense. Behaviors of the people are so unrealistic. There is no survival instinct in movie. There is a giant man with a chainsaw who is chasing them and they all are like '' this party is really good, right?''. What the ..? Just wasting time.",2022-02-20
"Turn off your brain and just enjoy it for the sake of the outstanding saga. Yes, there's a lot of flaws and overall it feels like the script was just a mess of random kill scenes. But if you're a slasher fan, that's what you have to expect watching movies like this one. Thrilling, gripping and blood-spilling stuff with no room for common sense. The bus scene is super cool and is probably a quintessence of this so-called 'sequel'. Yeah, could've been way better, but we have what we have. Nothing beats the TCM with Matthew McConaughey anyway lol. Looking forward to more.",2022-02-22
The kills were awesome like the bus scene but why did that lady with the cops just play dead for a super long time? And why didn't the people in the bus form a mob and start over whelming leatherface or shoot leatherface while he's distracted.,2022-02-20
"I really, really wanted to like this movie. I really did. I think the first half had a good metaphor going and despite all the trite and done into the dirt woke talking points, I felt like it had a purpose. But once the bodies started to drop, so did all of that potential.Not only that, but this movie presents a devastating and, quite frankly, insulting end to the original heroine Sally Hardesty. Not only does she not get any semblance of closure or vengeance, she bleeds out in a literal pile of garbage and her only purpose was as a nostalgia hook and to give the new final girl a narmy line of wisdom and a gun before she presumably dies.In addition, glaring plot holes and a general lack of what is a critical element to the franchise, Leatherface'a family, really bring this movie down from what it could have been.Did it have good points? Of course. The kills were fantastic, and the camerawork was magnificent, as was the score. It was brutal, fast, and hard-hitting. It is also far from the worst sequel, despite its glaring flaws.Overall, it was an okay movie. There was so much wasted potential though, and thats a shame.",2022-02-20

"I had very low expectations for this, Netflix is notoriously bad at making movies. I liked the cinematography, beautiful set. I like that they at least tried to incorporate the original in the beginning. However it just went downhill, the characters were all awful. Sally could have been a real saving grace but this movie ruined her character. Leatherface was ok but it just lacked that psychological aspect that really gets you with the original. It had the isual tropes of course, like of course he was going to jump out of the water, of course people who absolutely should be dead were still alive and you guessed it, they didn't make sure he was dead. Because sure enough he wasn't. A couple of scenes were ok and started well but overall they missed an opportunity here... and I really with they didn't make Sally such a bad cartoon character.",2022-02-20
"I had relatively high hopes for this film after the original sequel was so poor but this was incredibly bad. The characters are so dumb, when they're in the car and they try and run leatherface over, wtf are they thinking, just drive off! And again at the end just drive off don't sit and wait for the sunroof to open ffs! Another thing, why after watching him tank several shotgun blasts do you follow him into a dark abandoned movie theatre, such unrealistic behaviour. Both people you expect to put up a fight die instantly to a late 60 early 70 year old man, it's embarrassing. Apparently leatherface was an Olympic level sprinter aswell, no one can out run him it's just stupid. The characters are so dislikable, never have I wanted the villain to be so successful as in this film. Only good parts was the bus scene for the pure comedic value of them being sliced up and the very end scene where the character I can't even remember the name of gets her head removed, that was also rather funny. Overall I'd avoid, unless you want to waste 90 minutes.",2023-08-27

Then decided to click watch.This is just another Netflix bull crap movie. Lib. Er. Al. Ugh.Oh and that pull over scene... Crazy that the ONLY person who gets nervous when pulled over was the black guy. But yeah.... Why were they pulled over? There was no reason, and that WOULDNT happen in real life.Bad cops. Rednecks. Big guns. ""the end of capitalism"" ""but that confederate flag was my daddy's!!!!!""Ahhhhh!!!!!! And then FINALLY the gore. And I'm like PLEASE KILL THEM ALL.Anyway...

"Every time a TCM movie comes out that isn't the original most people just come to collectively agree that ""it's terrible"". This is only true because the first one set the bar pretty high, and was legendary for its time. But people need to appreciate for what this movie does well. The movie might not be scary, but there are horrific and gross scenes. Completely besides the fact this movie also has the most kills. When it comes to cinematography this movie had some really cool shots. It had a poor story and some cringy scenes but the action gets started and it's fun. This is also the shortest one so this movie isn't really boring. The soundtrack was alright, they all sounded the same but it was still terrifying. Out of all the leatherfaces this one is the most sad looking and alone, which makes it unique from the other ones. It doesn't have the vibe as a TCM movie but it did do one thing perfectly and it's the gore. No one can argue with that. Everyone needs to stop collectively hating on movies and believe their own opinion.",2022-07-10
The others where great and I'm guessing when netflix got their hands on the title they had to make it some liberal bs backstory instead of what it's allways been about.The other movies has had some small story about the teens and why they came to texas. And after that it's just been about the chainsaw massacre. I wouldn't recomend anyone to watch this trash. Go and see the older ones that had some great visuals and story.,2022-03-01
"The idea is that this is a direct continuation of the original TCM and none of the other films matter here. So far so good....wait doesn't that make Leatherface 75? Yes. Yes it does.Spoilers ahead.......So in the 50 years between these 2 films we are left to assume Leatherface stops killing and stops wearing skin masks. For 50 years. Then gets triggered and goes on a bigger killing spree than any of the films made before this. Plot holes are real. Script was weak and run time was too short. Good acting from most of the cast for what they were given. The writing did not make you care about anyone, even the OG survivor. Nothing was fleshed out with the characters.Now that being said, there were some positives for sure. The kill count is high and the effects were very good. A good chunk of the kills happen in a closed off space so that nobody could get away. That helped with the whole 75 year old Leatherface issue at least temporarily. There was a lot of good ideas here that needed more time to develop.IMO this is an average film in the series that is worth a watch but its as average as it gets.",2022-02-19
I really did not like this movie. The gore was pretty good but the story and characters where just so disapointing.I watched the original on cinema a few years ago. Me and my friend was really laughing trough the movie because it was just not scary and it really had not aged that well in my opinion. But i really liked the concept of it and i feel like this movie just trashes it. It was gory as hell but what is gore without a good underlying story?I have to say the gore is superb in this film. With loads of good shots troughout and i think that's the only thing that was good in this one. Was it scary? Not at all.,2022-06-04

"I just remembered that this movie exists!😁I decided it to watch this after binging The Cuphead Show because ironically, both the show and the movie came out on the same date! Anyway, I didn't hate it, but I didn't think it was good either. It was just a mediocre movie to me. I did like a lot of the kills in this movie, especially in the party bus scene and I think the actors gave it their all in this. The part I didn't like was near the end of the film. The part where Sally returned to take on Leatherface was pretty goofy and the final act didn't really satisfy me. I'm probably gonna get laughed at for this but, the ending honestly surprised me.Other than that the movie's pretty ""Meh"" to me.",2023-01-20
"Oh, here we go again. Another waste of time and money. Instead of trying to be original it turned out to be another mindless movie with unlikable characters. They could have cut down the running time to 5 minutes just showing the dumb cast getting slashed. That would be better than this yawner. I just could not stand to watch the whole thing. I just wish someone would make a decent horror movie for once rather than this drivel. The only redeeming quality is watching some of the cast getting offed. So, I am running out of words to describe this movie. Take my advice and go watch the original movie.",2022-10-05
"Being a fan of both the 1974 Tobe Hooper original and the 2003 remake, I was excited to see what this team could deliver to a new installment. I wasn't expecting much, since this film released straight to Netflix. I went into the film with an open mind and was easily, immediately impressed by the cinematography. The storyline, however, made it seem like the writers wanted so desperately to appeal to today's generation, rather than write a good script. The backstory with the school shooting felt unnecessary and gratuitous, at most. Another complaint I have would be Leatherface's speed and agility in the film. Hear me out. The film takes place 50 years after the original, so that would make Leatherface a very old, old man, right? So, why do we see him tackling young adults and jumping...literally jumping, out of a flooded hole in the floor?Overall, I thought the film was decent for what it was. A fun, gory slasher with memorable kills. I give it a 6/10.",2022-02-19

Clearly better then so many disappointing offerings us true eat, sleep etc horror fans have had to endure recently.

"An absolutely uninspired answer to David Gordon Green's Halloween trilogy. Every opportunity for a good story was given, but everything that was great about the original is thrown out of more windows than Sally Hardesty in the original. Not only did they opt for poorly executed millennial humor which falls flat, they barely give Sally the time of day, she is killed in such a quick manner when more emotion was expected killing a legacy character off. She then lives long enough to deliver the most cliché lines before dying. Not to mention they copy pasted Laurie Stride's character from Halloween (2018).Ignore this one and stick to the original The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974).",2022-06-21

I love the Chainsaw movies to an extent. The only reason I didn't hate this movie is because of how brutal it ended up being. It's enjoyable if you look past the flat acting and boring story.

"This is yet another attempt to revive The Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise after so many disappointing sequels. This sequel is one of them - a mess.Here are the positives for me:Cool and brutal kills. The bus scene was pretty terrifying and it did shock me.Leatherface's design, cinematography and acting were pretty fine.The plot is not too different from the rest, but it is decent.The two sisters were fine and I felt some sympathy for them. It also had some slow suspense which did keep me at the edge of my seat.The negatives:Bland characters apart from the two sisters.Leatherface is supposed to be in his 70s, and yet he is still super fast and strong. How?Lacks logic in certain scenes.Sally - a legacy character - couldn't have been more wasted in this movie. Pathetic treatment. I don't blame the actress here, I blame the script, which is a ripoff of Halloween 2018.The ending is just so disappointing and bad and it lacks logic to the point where I want to contact the directors and screenwriters and tell them how bad they did with this ending. I won't spoil it, but do expect a final act that lasts too long and goes nowhere.This is just a sequel for those who aren't fan of the series and want a silly slasher film with blood and gore. It's decent, but there were so many missed opportunities.",2022-02-19
"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise has some of the most toxic fans! None of the movies satisfy them lol. As someone who grew up watching Halloween, Friday The 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, etc. It came as a shock to me that I had never seen the original 1974 movie when I did as a teenager. After watching many of the reboots and sequels I honestly don't understand why they don't like them as much as the original film but in horror movie world they are solid films. Anyways Netflix did a pretty good job with this movie. There were a few questionable things and even moments where I was like really but overall it's a solid movie. Didn't really add too much to the timeline and story and didn't take away too much. I would've liked for it to explore more things that happened in the original but it's cool. Good ending. A good follow up to a movie that came out over 40 years ago. 8/10 in my book! Definitely a watch!",2022-02-18
"I'm not sure if these directors have got the memo yet - I mean, it's been decades since the original movie, but excessive and shocking gore isn't what made the original TCM a fan favorite. It was the fear of the unknown, and how the script adapted seamlessly to the macabre setting. You never knew when the mysterious killer would show up and who he would take to the grave while much of his screen time was limited until the end.It feels like they threw in a bunch of brutal kills, added in the generic teen gathering in the background and hoped for the best.Don't get me wrong; this isn't about the characters being unlikable or not having enough development. It's the fact that the story moves in such a predictable pace that you can't help but frown at the sheer potential this movie had as a returning title to introduce Netflix audiences to the spine-chilling authentic terror of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I found none of that here.As a standalone movie, it's fine. Don't expect to be blown away. The tense horror action is there. What makes a great horror movie, though, isn't.",2022-02-18
"Texas Chainsaw Massacre is directed by David Blue Garcia and stars Elsie Fisher, Sarah Yarkin, Jacob Latimore, Mark Burnham as Leatherface, and Olwen Fouere.Filmed in Bulgaria, the film tells the story of four friends with a mission to rejuvenate the rural and largely forgotten town of Harlow, Texas, due to the horrific events of the original 1974 film. They plan to start up some independent businesses and breathe new life into a town plagued by evil. However, they soon realise the evil may still reside within an unyielding family of cannibals, wherein one of the last remaining members, Leatherface, will stop at nothing to rid the town of.... Everyone(?) and do a lot of slicing, carving, butchering and mowing with a chainsaw.Going into this, it's one of those movies you don't expect much from. If there's some scares, suspense, fun gore and potentially some characters you care about, it's about as good as you can expect in the 9th entry of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise, which is also effectively the 3rd or 4th reboot/new incarnation. The film does offer some mildly suspenseful moments, particularly a scene taking place within a crashed police van, and is overall fairly watchable.However, the closest thing to an actual character you get is the oddly miscasted Elsie Fisher, who is a reclusive person with a highly traumatic past, hence the terror she experiences in the film is supposed to be amply terrifying, on account of her being traumatised. But it just doesn't come through very effectively, as the film doesn't delve into any of the psychology of having experienced violent trauma, other than showing a bullet scar on her chest.After the previous directing duo were fired from production after the film was shot, director David Blue Garcia, and cinematographer Ricardo Diaz manage to make Sofia, Bulgaria look enough like a rural, dusty Harlow, Texas, utilising some good location, such as a field of dead sunflowers, and a town main street that does look like a movie set, but an endearing one at that.The blood and guts come with vigour and excess, which fans and gore hounds will appreciate, but the violence doesn't have the dread-soaked ferocity and impact of The Hills Have Eyes remake, it's just there in the movie. The slick look and production design just don't sustain even a brisk 83 minutes of what is a forgettable horror sequel with some pretty shoddy and lame writing in the third act. If all you're looking for is some gore and viscera, this may be merely passable, but it doesn't hold a candle to the ferociously eerie and grotesque original, nor the 2003 remake.",2022-05-13

"I thought the director did a good a job. It was distinct and stylish and had some decent creativity. I suspect Fede Alvarez helped David Blue Garcia out quote a bit due to the task ahead of them, but even so, it was well made and lean and mean and gory and grungey and I quite liked it. Dumb characters making the same mistakes is getting irritating and I wish it would stop, but it happens plenty in this film. But, there are some really good kills that make up for the parts of this movie that are lacking. It's the best Texas Chain Saw Massacre film since the second film and I hope David Blue Garcia gets many more opportunities. Keep giving the gore and give it in buckets!",2022-02-19
I don't understand the bad reviews I absolutely loved this I'm a massive horror fan especially old school and always loved leather face but I would definitely put this as one of the top of all Texas chainsaw massacres it has everything you want in a horror ignore the bad reviews and enjoy it for what it is.,2022-02-18
This might be the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot must've been written by a teenager because only a Gen Z liberal could've come up with something this bad. I really wanted to stop this movie 15 minutes in but I had to finish this train wreck. Anybody who rates this over 5 stars does not know what a good film is.,2022-02-20
"First off, I did not expect a masterpiece or an engaging, profound story.What I did expect however was some proper pacing, respect for the characters and a little credibility.I know credibility sounds off, given the genre of the movie, please hear me out.Leatherface stabs a woman through her chest (with a running chainsaw ffs) lifts her in the air and tosses her in the garbage.Said woman survives this long enough to play deus ex machina for the two final girls.About respect for the characters, you bring back the original final girl to have her only serve as a distraction and as puncture bag.I mean it is a slasher movie, people get brutally murdered, I'm all for that.It is the genre after all, but she was only there to be disposed off.A little character building goes a long way when it comes to enjoying a story.The garage guy and the younger sister were the only likeable characters for me.About the pacing, the movie was what 80 minutes long and still it felt like an eternity.The gore was splendid, I mean a bus full of people sawed to pieces by the man himself.Perfect!",2022-10-31
"This movie was horrible. The kids in it are hipster idiots and I'm not surprised they died. They bring back the original survivor only to kill her off in the stupidest way.

If the original actress was still alive, she would not approve of what you did to her character. Bad writing all around. Just end the franchise already!",2022-07-01

"The characters were annoying and rude, how are you gonna barge in someones home & tell them to leave when you were clearly in the wrong. I'd be pissed too leatherface. Characters make weird decisions like have one of the friends go to the hospital with this complete stranger...ok? Bushy hair girl was annoying & had no reason to have hair that bushy. Her driving was pathetic & it looked like she crashed in the wall on purpose (bushy hair got in the way?). Bushy hair girl also saw a dead person & ran to the back of the bus & didn't tell anyone. I am not a fan of bushy hair girl. Anyway the plot was weird & should've been trashed. The character coming back from the original was dumb & got chainsawed up but someone came alive to give a final shot? The party bus scene was so dumb too, no one would take out a phone & immediately start recording like those 20 people did when leatherface walked on the bus & the all sat their like spam bots to get killed.Anyway there were only a couple good things . This leatherface was extremely violent & the gore scenes were great. Also, seeing bushy haired girl get her head chopped off right before the credits gets a plus in my book.Overall, stick to the 2003 remake or 2006 prequel, they were much better.",2022-02-21
"Right out of the gate, you know you are watching the most insufferable, smug main characters possibly ever! There is zero to like about them, from their immediate bashing of a Texan for having a gun to their gasp moment when they see a confederate flag flying outside a building they supposedly bought. I mean, they bought property in a remote area of Texas. What did they think was going to happen? They then proceed to kick Leatherface's mother out of her house, at which point she has a heart attack and dies. I mean, I don't blame Leatherface for being pissed. I should not feel myself rooting for him, but that's exactly what happens.The only likable guy, the Texan Mechanic, well, too bad he dies pretty quickly. To top it all off, one of the worst cameos I've ever seen. The only survivor from the original movie is allegedly a Texas Ranger, but she shoots a shotgun from a long distance range toward Leatherface!? Huh!? Oh, and that's after she decides to have a conversation with him instead of just killing him. Do yourself a favor, skip this movie, or watch it for a good laugh!",2023-10-31

"It tries to make a comeback just like so many other franchises have done lately, some have had success like Halloween (2018) or Ghostbusters, some others like this one failed miserably.There's not a good enough setup for the massacre that's coming, it doesn't dwell on the past lore, Leatherface kind of just appears out of nowhere and starts killing people. The lead characters are incredibly stupid as well as the character homage whose name I can't even remember as she just appears for a few minutes before getting killed without doing anything.The film has an incredibly weak script, the performances are ok but they're not enough to save this film from crashing into the abyss of forgetful entries in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise.",2022-03-19
"I had fun with this movie. Some dumb characters getting slaughtered, some real grizzly death scenes, packaged nicely into an 80 minute movie. If you like gory horror movies that crank things up to eleven (the bus scene lol), you should enjoy this. If you don't like gory horror movies, why are you even watching? It's called Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and it does exactly what it says on the tin. Is it as good as the original 1974 movie? Hell no, of course not. But it's perfectly entertaining and, most importantly, as nasty as it needs to be. Cheers to Netflix for reuniting Leatherface and his chainsaw in 2022.",2022-02-22

Texas Chainsaw Massacre the title fits the movie. The movie definitely includes Leatherface in all his gory Glory. The movie does not throw in a bunch of cheap useless nudity or teenagers screwing around it gets right to the point. It is a stupid movie watch it with that in mind. Not every movie has to make sense or be inclusive sometimes just shut your brain off and watch dumb people on the receiving end of a chainsaw. This movie contains every single one of the dumbest horror movie mistakes ever wrapped into one movie. There's no denying it but I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. The movie is fun nothing more so have fun and watch a movie.,2022-02-20
"I honestly wanted to like this so bad because I am a huge fan of the original and I do like Fede Alvarez but at this point this isn't Texas Chainsaw. I was more than excited when it was announced that TCM was coming back and Fede was producing this. The plot of this TCM is rather dull and not exciting when a group of internet influencers come to Texas to reignite a town that has seen better days and is a ghost town. With that, we get a cast that is less than interesting and you can't help but wait for their fate to be sealed at the hands of Leatherface. The one thing I did genuinely enjoy was seeing how this version brought back original final girl Sally Hardesty back into the mix of things. Unfortunately, this TCM lacks things that we been known to love.....chase scenes are lacking and the story is just down right bad. I'll give the kills in this TCM are top notch, brutal and swift and just when you think the protagonists have gotten away, boom comes the final shocker. These version is notch up above TCM 3D and Leatherface but definitely below the 2004 remake and the original.",2022-02-18
"I'll keep it short. If you were a fan of the Texas Chainsaw franchise, you'll likely be super disappointed with this one. It feels like the writing was really lazy.

It's 3rd most watched movie right now on Netflix, but I know exactly the reason because I see this trend of movie-watching at my friend's house: they put the movie on in the background while my friends continue the party and conversation.

I didn't like all the previous installment, for I thought few dared deliver a true expression of massacre, and I think this one does a good job at that.I mean, the bus scene is top-notch.Plot-wise, some reactions from characters were hard to understand, the kind of scenes that make you roll your eyes up. But I wacthed that movie with the expectation of some good texas chainsaw massacre, and i was clearly not disappointed. I think the directors made a great move here, surfing on that 2022 wave that touching the franchises right now and they made their own thing with their own twisted concepts.I hope they do a sequel.",2022-02-26

Driving a Tesla woke ideas of the couple..blah blah.. next chainsaw massacre he will be in a proper suit with a electric chainsaw and a Cybertruck. Best thing was seeing them get massacred.,2022-02-20
These get worse every single one they do... just needs to stop now. Terrible acting and it's the same story everytime... just boring and rubbish! When are they ever gonna stop?!,2022-02-25
"Following the ""reequel"" trend a little too closely, Leather Face throws his chainsaw into the ring with all the grace, subtlety, and talent of a monkey flinging a turd at a streaming service near you. In this sequel to the original film we follow a group of new age hipsters that want to renovate the town of Harlow but their hipster plans are put to a halt when they impede upon the home of Leather Face. The issue with this film is mainly its characters and how they are all insufferable assholes that you only want to see die, if your into the violence that's cool but it robs the film of any suspense. There is a legacy character returning in this film but her contribution to the film is so minuscule and pointless it's just disrespectful to even have had her in this ""film"" at all. If you watch these movies for the violence alone its for you, but violence is all this movie has and it is a hollow experience lacking any substance, suspense, horror, or otherwise. This film is a hard pass, do not, can not recommend that anyone see this film for any reason other than murder porn, a fall far from grace considering the impact and legacy of the original.",2022-02-23
"What a mess, from the start, I found the main gang of characters to be entirely cringy, unlikeable and utterly underwhelming. It does feel intentional that they're setup for the slaughter with the largely entitled way they were written. Will they die? Will they survive? Who cares? The way they treat and speak to other people would probably catch up to them anyway. There seems to be an intentional ""kill the Gen Z'ers"" setup that comes to fruition.A real opportunity to explore and investigate the past Chainsaw events as these ""kids"" clean up the town was missed. Little things and events could have ultimately triggered their run in with Leatherface. Could have been a great primer for a whole series.It's a short trip where even nostalgia can't survive in a film whose dusty message seems to echo the Sheriff's warning at the beginning.It would have stayed a quiet town if it weren't for you jerky kids.The track during the neon, seizure inducing credits was cool though...",2022-03-05
"It is a classic horror movie, nothing special, but i liked it. I think that it is a bit repetitive, because it's too similar to the first. Also, the fact that the killer is practically invincible is really boring.",2022-02-22
If done another way I think this could have been good. I feel like the mistake was introducing social media and.influencers. From there and forward it was all over the place.,2022-03-02
"I am a big fan of the franchise, but this disappointed me alot. The movie picks up 40 years after the original. Leatherface has not been caught and Sally Hardesty is a recluse. It updates the franchise by interweaving the social media theme with influencers. The story is very weak and leaves alot to be desired, the writing and acting is laughable the characters die too early. It is trying to be the new Halloween by having Leatherface still around after 40+ years of killing and old characters are trying to kill him. The gore is good, and Leatherface got alot smarter over the years. He was dumb as toast in the first movie. Overall if your looking for something to fill your time with some laughs, this is it. This had potential and they missed the mark. Leatherface the movie was better and that was not that good either.",2022-05-12
Turned off this garbage movie after the 15 minutes because all the commentary consisted of was typical political divisive garbage. What a shame this even has the same name as the original.,2022-02-28
"This franchise have been butchered for the last 20 years so I can't say I had any hope for this but you know, sometime all you need is a gory slasher to kill time. It's the most mean spirit movie I've seen directed at Zoomers so that's a plus I guess.",2022-02-19
"Everything about this movie is cheap, the characters are really irritating, it shouldn't be allowed to share the name of the original! Yeh there was some extreme gore but that's about as interesting as it gets. Why was this ever made? The only thing okay about this....seeing woke gen z hipsters get taken out.",2022-02-20
"I had very low expectations going in but nothing could have prepared me for that trash. Not sure what was going through the directors mind when they created this but I wish they would have kept it to themselves. What does gun control, school shootings and racism have to do with a man who wears peoples skin as a mask and chases people with a chainsaw?I also don't understand how Leatherface looks exactly the same after 50 years and can still tear people apart with his bear hands. Leatherface literally saws Sally in what looks like in half and she survives and is still able to shoot a shotgun while bleeding out.The characters are literally the most generic, brain dead, and just unlikeable people in any movie ever made. Like why did the blonde girl not reach for the sheriff's gun when they crashed, instead she just acts like she died even though she's panting like she just ran a marathon.If your going to watch a Texas Chainsaw Massacre, please save yourself some time and watch the original.",2022-10-06
"I am literally begging someone to make a competent slasher film. Someone please please tell writers that if no one cares about your characters, there's no tension. There's no suspense. I don't care if these people die. I don't care if they get killed. The scene where none of the bus's windows were opening for some reason as if there's no emergency latches anywhere, except for the one the girl tries to open which flies open with no effort. Then there's a scene where the older woman tries to use the girls as bait but then just walks right into the killer's house and pulls a gun on him? And then doesn't use it? So why did you need the girls as bait? You waited 15 years to not shoot this dude? Why didn't she shoot him in the room but shot him five minutes later outside when he's about to kill the girls? And the girl not checking if the gun was loaded but she goes to shoot the killer. So, so bad. Omg.",2022-11-01
Great acting good kill scenes a new story I like it alot. A fun Joyride for all true fans of this beloved franchise. Love the patient the movie great camera work brought it back to form.,2022-02-23
Possible Spoilers!!!So since 1974...48 years after the original movie took place...Leatherface has just been chilling and living at an orphanage? And he's 60-70 years old and still lifting people off the ground with a chainsaw..and busting peoples arms with his brute strength? Decent gore..that's about it..characters were all obnoxious..couldn't wait for them to die...maybe that was the point. Obviously not the best TCM movie..but definitely not the worst.,2022-02-18
"I love the '74 TCM but the rest of the franchise is either just watchable or utter garbage (with the exception of the 2003 remake, which was surprisingly well made).So i wasn't expecting much from this one, but it was actually decent and i enjoyed it more than the other sequels/prequels. It has definitely its issues tho and some scenes were pretty stupid.All in all a decent slasher.",2022-02-20
"You know what you're signing up for this film and the film lives up to those expectations. There is the modern take on the classic, however with the young rich techno-savy millennials rocking up to take over Mr chainsaw massacres town which is mummified in the 1970's. Obviously they piss off Mr Chainsaw Massacre who then proceeds to gut all of them in various ways mostly using his chainsaw. It's just a shame the gore doesn't really shock these days. Might be worth taking a different approach to these films if you want to revitalise the franchise...maybe put him in space next?",2022-03-04
"Texas Chainsaw murderer 2022 is a good movie. Don't comment maliciously. After all, it's not old. I see that the box office of 2020's ""moonlight light heart panic"" is good, so it's released. We look at it rationally. All of you sitting here are old fans of Texas Chainsaw murderer and have feelings. Finally, I hope this movie has a good box office and a good start.",2022-02-21
"Believe me, I enjoyed this was more than most of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre sequels. My personal favorites in the series are the first two. Anything after that, I don't care to ever see any of them again. Except this one. This one contains scenes that most would feel like they'd see in a movie with a title like Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Blood and guts don't automatically make a horror movie good, but this delivers. The characters are under developed, but it's a horror movie. I expect that. They make dumb decisions, but if they didn't, there would be no movie. It's a good ""turn off your brain and watch a slasher"" type of movie.",2022-02-19
"This is almost like a parody of the halloween legacy sequels. This film is hilariously bad with its writing, effects and plot. It's so inconsistent.It's good as a bad horror movie night film for you to laugh at but other than that it's truly awful.It contains a lot of what's wrong with modern cinema in the sense of it's trying to be clever but instead it comes off as a rip off of halloweens legacy sequels down to the hilarious parody to Laurie strode. How they're not getting sued I don't know.The acting is genuinely awful, the story makes very little sense and it seems to fail to keep track of its own story. There are so many gaping plot holes.Please save your time and don't bother with this steaming pile of ....",2022-03-20
"The original (1974) is a genuine horror classic. Texas Chainsaw 2 takes a bit of a different approach, but is still enjoyable in a campy way. The next 2 films were lackluster at best, but 2003's remake was perhaps the 2nd best film after the original. Hollywood dished out several follow-ups that were mediocre at-best. Now comes this steaming pile of garbage....Let's get the good of the way first - Visually, this movie is actually pretty decent, dare i say fantastic looking. The way certain scenes are shot left me at least visually pleased. I'm not familiar with this director, but there is some talent there...now they just need to find some better writers.The Bad - first and foremost, this film suffers from the main thing that hurts most horror films in the last 20 years or so, and is always my #1 complaint.... The characters are extremely unlikable and hard to root for. I'm not sure who's idea it was to have the 4 leads be these narcissist hipsters obsessed with social media, but these days it's not a shock this is what the viewer is given as heroine's. Secondly, why the heck are these young people flocking to what is essentially a ghost town? Was Austin, Texas all stocked up??? The one guy is a chef, is his food so delicious it's going to rescue this town out of poverty??? I've seen this movie twice and i still don't know what the plan was. Also, since we are dealing with Gen-Z self-righteous bozo's, there needs to be a little social commentary, of course. The curly-haired snob scoff's at someone carrying a gun, the other snob just survived a school-shooting. Of course, by the end of the movie both are practically Sarah Connor. Then there is the ""bus scene"" in which some yuppie informs Leatherface that he will be ""cancelled"" if he tries to hurt any of the dozens of other yuppies on-board the bus......yikes. If the aim of this film was to cause the viewer to cheer for the chainsaw-wielding maniac who goes around slaughtering people, then it succeeded, but we all know that wasn't the plan. Finally, there is a cameo near the end in which the original ""final-girl"" shows up to save the day, but just like everyone else, is a complete clown who makes all the wrong choices.There are other reasons this is a 2 star movie, but i'm done talking about this. They may have had something here if they had some decent writing, or different plot because the film does look great at times. However, we get this nonsensical plot which feels very rushed, almost like the producers had a few key scenes in their head and just wrote a script around them. I've also seen others mention that the ""kills"" in this were unique and cool. I guess so, but that type of stuff isn't why i enjoy horror films, but if gore and watching people meet their fate in quirky ways is something you enjoy then this might be for you.",2023-10-30
"The movie is so cheap.I'm proud of myself making it through the whole movie, what a waste of time. Definitely does not deserve the 4,8, should be a 3 or lower...Not realistic, bad acting, bad dialogs, bad set.",2022-05-02
"I don't understand why I kept watching. It was getting worse every minute. It's seriously a waste of time, I can't tell a thing I like about this movie. Damn.",2022-05-02
Totally predictable. No actual story to it. Watched expecting it to be like the original but nothing like. Don't waste your time watching. It's just all gore that's the whole film THE END🙄,2022-03-19
"I'm so glad I didn't go on the reviews left by quite a few amateurs who can't seem to appreciate the eclectic nuances of the art of film making! The lack of fame of these protagonists might have been the only deterrent for me but I overcame.From the beginning the foundation was laid solid with apt dialog that adhered to the canon complimented with superb minimalistic acting prowess of these young thespians left me quite content with the story line, premise and twists in the plot that kept the film gripping. Not the mention the unapologetic classic blood and gut wrenching gore!Trust me, all the original ingredients of this spicy Chilli concoction have come straight from the original meat grinder of what we know of as the Massacre in Texas by Way of Chainsaw! Bon Appétit!",2023-03-21
"It's 2022, you really can't expect Horror movies to be at the top of genres. I feel those days of the 70""s/80""s/90""s/2000""s are over.You have to take these films for what they are brute force gore with little to no plot it weak direction. Honestly if you like Gore and Leatherface you'll likely rate this over 5.0 maybe 5.1-5.2If the plot had been stronger this film really could of been a solid 6.0-6.6 rating here.I LOVE horror films. My PLEX Server Which is 50tb has mostly horror from old to new. I really wish the writing could of been better. It's ashame. The movie does close on a possible Part II which would likely be direct to Netflix.If you're bored and wanna see Leatherface kill some people grab a beverage and some microwave popcorn and enjoy. Just don't Take the film seriously.",2022-02-23
"I watched this with low expectations but knew it would be something my wife wouldn't want to see, so it entertained for a while when she went out.It's a modern sequel to a classic story of course.

"I really hoped that this movie would bring me some of the same feelings the original did.However I was very dissaointedWhilst the movie did make some fantastic gore scenes and the build up had me excited for what might come at the end, litteraly everything else was a let down.The story line was cheap and at many times laughably bad. (Why the hell do you let someone you have been hunting for 40 years just walk out of a room to attack others)
The main story was abandoned as soon as the action started and replaced with blood and gore.And impossible events happening for no reason (how do you get picked up by a chainsaw and thrown away, and still live to shoot a gun and make one last line)And to top it off it has one of the worst endings to a movie I've seen in a long time.",2023-02-01

"Tobe Hooper must be turning in his grave. I wonder if anyone who churns out these TCM films has actually seen the original. Its remarkably light on gore. But heavy on suspense, well done jumps and a foreboding feeling of dread. What it's not is a cheap gore fest. There is not one redeeming feature in this film. The characters are insipid, bland and totally unlikeable. The acting is woeful. The pacing is bizarre. The premise is hilarious. Leatherface has been reduced to a Michael Myers style immortal killer, rather than an inbred weapon used by his family, which is a far more unsettling thought. The dining table scene in the original has more dread in static shots than this, or any TCM film since, can ever hope for. Avoid, it really is that bad.",2022-02-24
I quite enjoyed this! Just your usual run of the mill slasher. Characters not particularly interesting but likeable enough. The ending was absolutely stupid though... even for a horror.,2022-07-27
"If you can't make a decent film with all the content, lore and inspiration laid out in front of you, then don't bother.Honestly this film has taken a highly unrealistic approach to the OG that is texas chainsaw massacre, and not because of the story or plot.The film is based around gen z fighting the everlasting entity that is leatherface, as he spends about an hour and half mutilating everybody on set.There are just times the film is building suspense just to piss all over it with some pathetic struggle and violence. Leather face is depicted as he always is, not saying a word or just grunting like a wanking pig with ofcourse the added ability of invulnerability.Awful.",2022-03-27
Ridiculous plot that doesn't link up to the original in any common sense manner. Was really looking forward to this but looks like there was bo thought out into this nor anyone that worked on the original. Big let down.,2022-02-19
"I felt very disappointed after watching this movie. There was nothing original on it. The actions of the characteres were totally predictable or plainly ridiculous (and I'm thinking on the confrontation between Leatherface and Hardesty).The worst thing is that this film is not even scary. Ah, how I missed that chilling setting of the original movie...This movie was a real waste of time. Three stars.",2022-02-20
"The production was there, the score was good, the new ""skin mask"" was effective... but this movie was just misguided and dumb. There were these subplots that were so unnecessary and distracting, I was constantly getting pulled out of the movie. The direction was inconsistent in tone. And what a total waste of Sally's story. Pointless and frustrating. Skip this one.",2022-02-20
"My god. Can we just watch a movie anymore that doesn't throw leftism in your face every 2 minutes? It would be a lot less worse if they did it with any tact, but of course these leftist producers are so far in their bubbles that they can't even avoid being blatantly biased and silly.Politics aside, terrible movie and acting and everything.",2022-05-30
"Many of the kills are brutal and satisfying, however the rest of the movie has a somewhat Marvel super hero cinematic feel to it that doesn't work at all, the tone feels off at points. An extremely short run time of one hour and fourteen minutes, it doesn't feel long enough for the next canon entry in the movie series which is supposedly trying to reboot. Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2022 is just plain disappointing. Had some moments been played out differently and the tone had been less cheerful, I would have given this movie a seven instead of a five though definitely worth a watch if you're right into the kills in horror movies.",2022-02-18

For the beginning I rate this a 5, the end probably brings it closer to a 4.",2022-02-23
If you are going into this movie expecting a great story than you will be sorely mistaken buttt if you love kills and gore than this is the film for you other than that it offers nothing else to the table but surprisingly still a 5 for me.,2022-03-03
I thought it was a new and pretty cool take on leather face! I hope they continue these movies. We can't keep having the old formula for scary movies and I like to have an open mind. And the gore scenes are really cool and extremely gory! I would recommend watching this.,2022-03-26
"Yes there are flaws and the story is not solid. However.... Acting from the leader is solid. There is a story, and there is also NO mercy!!!

"I've been a fan of most of Fede Alverez work and here is no different. There's a lot of negativity directed towards at this film and I can't seem to understand why. I think the film has a topics in it that typically involve people who either don't want to talk about them or think it's corny anytime theirs a social light on them. I've seen a lot of people say they don't understand what the film was trying to say or do and really the answer is nothing.It seems a lot of people have watched a different move than I. This movie is about a traumatized young person who survived a school shooting, they are uncomfortable around guns because of this but again the film doesn't take a opinionated side on any of this, it simply exist for us to view and understand how the character functions. This traumatized person is being dragged around by her sister and their very, rich and entitled friends. When they make mistakes out of ignorance and judgment leatherface starts murdering everyone.It's short, straightforward, the violence and effects are some of the best, the soundtrack will put your body in fight or flight, there are younger less experienced actors in it and they can be a bit hammy at times but if that's not true to the original then I don't know what is.",2022-03-13

"I love the original first two movies but the franchise has a history of making pretty poor movies in my opinion so I had low expectations for this, but I really liked it! One of the reasons I'm not giving it a 10 is because I feel that they didn't need to bring back Sally Hardesty. It felt a bit forced. I feel like they could have kept Richter alive a bit longer to almost fulfil Sally's part in the movie. I'm not saying I hated Sally being here as I loved the part where leatherface had no idea who Sally was even though he caused her a lifetime of suffering. This movie was quite a lot better than I expected and I can definitely see myself rewatching it.",2022-02-19
"It misses the mark of being a decent movie. The characters are gruesomely slaughtered before they can even develop a character arc. The gore is magnificent, but you become desensitized so early in the film, the rest is just ramped up to try to out do the last scene. If you're into empty calories, this movie is for you. For the rest of us, we'll stick with the first and the second.",2022-02-19
"I haven't watched the other chainsaw movies but this movie was awful. They could've done so much more with this story. They should've give more background information of the chainsaw psychopath. The guy from the garage had so much potential but he didn't bring any value to the storyline. Litterly nothing, it would be the same movie without him. They gave us barely any info about characters. And the movie was too short and got too fast in to action. This movie really didn't do anything to me, i feel like I just waisted 1 hour and 20 minutes of my life. But all this is just my opinion about the movie.",2022-02-20

"Although it was a good slasher flick and did extend the Leatherface legend, I couldn't get past some of the obvious errors. Now I understand that you have to have a certain suspension of disbelief when watching a slasher flick, but there were several glaring errors.After being buried in a wall for assumingely decades, a gas powered chainsaw would never work. The gas would be bad, the oil seized up, the gaskets all dried up and would never start unless it was rebuilt.The heroine couldn't figure out how to load and fire an AR-15, but has no problem working and shooting a pump action shotgun never having shot a gun in her life.Then for Leatherface, who has never been more than a mentally unstable killer, never inferred to be supernatural or anything like that, to take two point blank shots with a 12 gauge and get up...c'mon.",2022-02-21
"No suspense, no surprises, no scares. The most redeeming quality of this flop is how the producers found a cast of millennials so annoying that the audience will cheer each and every death. Do NOT let the movie title fool you into wasting your time, and it's not even a ""so bad it's good"" flick. It's just really, really bad.",2022-02-24
"Basically, the problem with this film was in its story and characters. The whole idea of throwing the old lady out of her place on a dime was ludicrous. Would never happen like that. Just a poor, laughable excuse to send Leatherface out seeking revenge. And he was pretty fit for a guy over 70! That, too: shot, stabbed, clobbered and he keeps on tickin! I guess this was Leatherface taken over by the spirit of Jason Voorhees. Things were introduced like ""hick police pull over 'city folk' to put fear of god in them"" but that was just a checklist item because it turned out not to be like this at all. Let's add gun-carrying pickup truck driving character to create more ""country folk"" vs ""city folk"" tension. (Same goes for gas station attendant.) Another checklist item. And, again, that went nowhere. Add to this how main characters are killed off before you even have a chance to like or hate them.Sure, the gore was great. But so what? Everyone is killed off in such a ho-hum manner without the slightest bit of tension that I felt I was watching someone's home movie of their kid's 8th birthday party. The ""massacre on the bus"" scene was equally boring and will stand as the greatest misuse of body count in cinema history.Also frustrating was how people were easily killed, yet they weren't really dead. They somehow sprung back to life in order to unnaturally push the tired plot along. The pathos with the school shooter surviving sister? That one was handled with the skill of an industrial video about manners in the workplace.Halloween, new Ghostbusters, this one, they're all made by and for people that weren't there when these films first came out. They rented them on video, felt badass about it, and now are in a position to make them for all the wrong reasons. Total garbage.",2022-02-20
"I am not a die hard Texas Chainsaw Massacre fan; I've only ever seen the original despite the many sequels and reboots but I'd be remiss if I didn't admit the original is a film I'll never forget; it's so gritty and feels so grimy, you wanna take a shower after it's all over. It's genuinely disturbing and made a massive impact on horror films. Sad to say this new film is not disturbing in the least and will definitely leave no impact on anything in the history of ever.But dang, is it so funny to watch.I appreciate that the writers made every character dumb and unlikeable; I was going into this hoping to see people be murdered in horribly brutal ways and the film does deliver on that front, but the kills feel a lot more satisfying this time round because the characters just suck so much. And PLEASE don't even get me started on how they shoehorn Sally Hardesty into this story in a terrible attempt to emulate Laurie Strode's new strength in 2018's Halloween. I know I said I wasn't a die hard fan but even her story in this felt like a massive slap in the face.The cinematography is good, at least. Music was pretty good. I appreciated the gore and practical effects, and Leatherface goes full Halloween Kills on everyone around him while also being completely invincible and impossible to wound. I kid you not, he blocks an entire shotgun blast with his chainsaw while running at the shooter. It's incredible.......y stupid.""Try anything and you're cancelled, bro"" isn't even the worst part about this, but if you're going into this to take it seriously, you're going about it all wrong. What you gotta do is get a group of friends, get seriously intoxicated and do your own RiffTrax together and just have fun with it. I honestly cannot wait for the sequel, I hope Leatherface wields dual chainsaws or something.",2022-03-08
"Very skeptical going in, and I wasnt surprised. A very lack luster addition to the lore.Filled with orginal movie callbacks that were uninspired.Stereotypical characters. Very uninteresting deaths. BUT...worth watching to witness the ""Darth Vader"" scene.If you know, you know.",2022-02-22
"When I heard netflix produced yet another remake of Chainsaw I asked myself 'why?'; was this the 4th or 5th remake? I lost count, each remake was a derivative of the original and never as good. So shocked I was when this version turned out to be a fresh take. I liked it, although the ending seemed rushed. It would have been better if they tied in the girl's school shooting experience into the end of the movie; perhaps showing her half-unconscious on the classroom floor dreaming the whole movie, or something like that? Also, note to Netflix, maybe 3% of all couples in the U. S. are comprised of a black person with a white person; yet according to you, that stat is reversed to be 97%. Sorry, but the filling of your diversity quota results in an unrealistic number of mixed-race couples in all of your programming. Guess what, there are some black people who pursue other black people for romantic relationships, and for you to ignore that fact only paints you as racist.",2022-02-19
This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. You would think while watching it that it is supposed to be a funny horror movie but it isn't. Worst movie I've watched.,2022-02-23
"Was loving it until we got to that ending where the girl tries to kill him with chainsaw! One word, cringeeeeeee!!!!!!!! But before that i was really enjoying it.",2022-02-24
I loved it! This is by far the best TCM sequel ever. The vibe was right. The gore score was at its maximum. Imaginative and brutal kill scenes reveal to us that horror icon Leatherface is back with a hardcore vengeance!!! While respect was given to the original it also created a new modern vibe: the blend was perfect! From the beginning to the end this is truly a modern day horror masterpiece!,2022-02-19
"If you're looking for a decent story, this movie will disappoint. The characters are extremely bland and stupid throughout the whole movie. However, if you can switch off and ignore most of the movies issues, it's a pretty fun gorefest. I found myself actually rooting for Leatherface. This movie can be unsettling with its gore at times so be warned.",2022-02-18
"Nothing too it really, some good gory bits but terrible plot and acting, 30 odd people on a bus not being able to stop 1 man with a chainsaw was the final nail in the coffin for Me.",2022-03-10
It was a good film through out but the ending was terrible I wouldn't recommend watching this film. It was too far fetched and just a rushed ending what made the film a disappointing watch.,2022-04-02
"I'm giving this a 5 or maybe optimistic 6 out of 10. I did enjoy watching it but it wasn't great and I probably wont go back to it.I'll start with some positives because there were things I liked.Firstly, what which stuck in my mind as I was watching was that it looked really great. It was well shot and I liked the settings. Plus the gore didn't look too bad and there were some moments of pretty effective visual horror!It got straight to the point, too. The movie's 83 minutes and it gets going quickly. I think it makes the assumption that most audience members have either seen the original or at least know something about it, so they don't waste much time getting down to business.It was pretty cheesy, which I see as a positive. I don't think the movie took itself too seriously and I think that's a good thing in this case. This movie isn't here to try and one-up the original, it's here for goofy slasher horror which is what I was expecting going in. Others might not agree with me there though, I admit.So that's the positives!As for the negatives, I think the main thing is that it was a little muddled in what it seemed to want to say, or whether it even wanted to say anything in the first place.For example, there's a plot point about the gentrification of a small, rural town and the clashing of new worlds and old but it doesn't really go anywhere with this and I think that there could have been a more interesting dynamic regarding that.It's been nearly 50 years since the original Massacre (which is pointed out in the movie) and the world has changed a lot since then, so there could absolutely have been some kind of greater underlying point about the past coming back to haunt people. Lila, one of the protagonists, has a painful personal past (which isn't handled well by the movie) and Sally, who makes a return, is also haunted by her experiences, so it could've worked well.But what we got instead was some half-hearted references to internet and influencer culture and how it doesn't really fit in with the rural setting.The movie has a lot of instances like this where it seems to want to introduce a theme but then does nothing with it. Whatever the movie might have wanted to say quickly gets lost under the noise of a chainsaw.Beyond that, I'd say the dialogue isn't great and some of the lines made me wince a little. That's impressive since I'm usually someone can often find bad dialogue quite endearing.I'd also say that some of the characters could maybe have been explored and fleshed out a little more. It seems like the movie has some cognitive dissonance and seemed to want to make a lot of characters both likeable and unlikeable, sympathetic and unsympathetic simultaneously.I know I said I like the movie's short run time, but I wouldn't have minded it being a bit longer if we got to know the characters a little better. It would be good if it was a bit clearer whether we're supposed to like them and care if they become chainsaw fodder!In summary, it's fine, perfectly serviceable and kinda fun. But not great and not memorable.It tries to have it's cake and eat it in terms of the un/sympathetic characters and the bad attempts at making statements about things. But as I said, it's not like the movie is taking itself seriously so some might be able to forgive that.The actual chainsaw massacre parts are the best part of the movie (terrible script aside, the bus scene is awesome) and there are plenty of references not only to the original TCM but other horror movies as well, which are fun if a little heavy-handed.I think what made the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre really special was that it was fuelled by America's fear for Ed Gein. This film, on the other hand, is fuelled by America's love for Texas Chainsaw Massacre, leading to both positive and negative results.It loves the source material and isn't trying to one-up it as I said, but it also doesn't want to do anything of its own and that shows and it leads to a movie which is okay at best.",2022-02-20

"This movie is a transparently bad attempt at cashing in on the recent hype around the Halloween movies by doing essentially the exact same thing.Predictably, Sally Hardesty is back from the original film (because of course she is) and she's a BADASS. So original.There's a lot of halfhearted political rhetoric disguised as character development, presumably only to fill up the runtime in between kills and to add anything resembling resembling personality to the walking tropes that are the main cast. There's no real personality to any of them, just a list of boxes ticked as usual.If I wasn't drunk at the time, I wouldn't have persevered to the end. Now, in retrospect, I really wish I didn't. Especially after hearing Sally yell dramatically ""I'm the one who got away, and I'm here to make sure you don't.""
My god, that is one of the most embarrassing lines of dialogue I've ever encountered.This is the lowest point of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise. Its soulless, by the numbers trash masquerading as something more. Another greedy reboot hopefully to be swiftly forgotten about.",2022-02-19
"This movie is nothing short of a good slasher- it's got gore, blood, and half-creative kills. However, it's characters are a bit 2D, there isn't any real storyline, the acting was meh, and a bunch of features were thrown in that didn't have any real impact and weren't needed. However, the movie is relatively short and the CGI and effects were amazing! This is a good brainless movie to watch with friends or watch during a sleepover late at night if you want an easy thriller.",2022-06-21
"Sorry, I could only stand about 10 minutes before I had to find something else. The movie opens when the 4 young adult stars (with their Tesla) encounter a man in a pickup truck wearing an American flag hat. One of them starts running their mouth about him wearing a pistol. Could you blatantly stereotype a little more cause I don't think we get enough as it is? Then they get into town and there's the Rebel Flag hanging out of the white people's house. I just don't understand all the underlying political tones not to mention a real estate auction with a DJ??? We get enough of that in every day life. We watch movies to escape every day life. Do better writers.",2022-02-19

"I don't know how you could actually make a film as forgettable, and as ridiculous as this. So apparently the leatherface character now has superhuman strength, despite the fact he must be 70-80 years old. He can be shot - with a shotgun, no less - several times, and it will have no effect on him whatsoever. I don't know why they made him into this supernatural, invincible being. I think the gunshot wounds vanished and all his clothes healed up as well.The people who made this mess have clearly never used a chainsaw before. His model cuts through wooden floorboards like paper and somehow starts up after spending fifty years buried in wall. I need to get me one of those.About half way through you think, ""well you might as well just make up anything now. Why not just make him fly if you're gonna throw all laws of physics and reality out the window?""Save yourself the bother and don't watch this, unless you enjoy being annoyed.",2022-02-19

"If you enjoyed the original, this will be nothing but a snooze fest and a generic slasher flick. If all you like is seeing dumb teens get killed by a man wearing a mask with human skin, this is the movie for you. However, if you have any idea of how a proper movie should pace, should introduce the characters (and how to make them likable), and how they shouldn't destroy an IP, you'll hate this film. This film is nothing similar to the original, and half of the film was extremely boring and i felt like i was just wasting my time.",2022-02-19
Still doesn't know how shotguns work. Not one person would be walking around with a shotgun round through their body. There would just be a hole where the bullet went through. C'mon. It was satisfying seeing the woke brats get messed up though!,2022-02-20
"I'll give the actors some credit here, because I think they did a fair job portraying the horribly abysmal script they were given. That being said, the movie as a whole is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There's no thread to follow, there's just this evil superman who murders people for no reason what so ever. I mean, the movie has a reason, but that reason is so trivial and generic, it makes the whole plot just ridiculous. I sometimes find enjoyment in watching really garbage movies, just because they are so bad, but this one is surely even beyond that. It's the first time I've ever seen someone being murdered and literally cringe. Total and utter garbage.",2022-02-20
"So.. I was one of the extras of this movie and I gotta say... They butchered half of the scenes and dialogue, this made the movie horrable and you cannot understand anything..for example - the auction at Harlow - the point was that the people there are buying the abandoned buildings at the Town ( the whole town was abandoned and was put on sale so people could buy at auction to make business) none of this was explained in the actual movie and was just randomly put there.I'm rly disappointed how this turned out as it was so much fun filming this movie and we really thought its going to be something.

It's not a good sign when you hope Leatherface is gonna kill a bunch of kids. Yes, I'm a fan of the og movies. They are some of the best raw, carnal horror movies. I like the 2003 remake of the original. The only ""sequels"" I will recognize to the original '74 classic are ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" '86 and ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" 2013.

This seemed like something that was drawn up in a day & made in about a week with no thought or effort put into it. ...And is it just me or did Leatherface look way too similar to the scarecrow in the Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark movie?",2022-02-24

Many people may not even notice because it's just so common nowadays. Also, Leatherface suddenly has motive? He's a sociopathic killer, he doesn't need motive. It's right there with Rob Zombie making Jason talk. Did I mention that the main characters aren't likable? I mean really whiny, weak, spiteful and sarcastic. The epitome of what's wrong with a lot of younger people nowadays. Just an awful group of kids. On the plus side, Leatherface is played well.",2022-02-25

"This movie unfortunately was a little too inspired by ""Halloween"" (2018) and i felt as if the situation with Sally was a little strange and it didn't feel like her character would still be that worried considering she survived the first time. But they kind of make her a Laurie Strode character with the ""i've been waiting 40 years for this day"". It just seemed played out. And the characters make idiotic decisions through out the whole movie which really made me eye roll. There are good moments like the bus scene which was very aesthetically pleasing to watch and gruesome. The two leads were pretty good to be honest. I can't quite understand why the blond girl decided to go with the ambulance to the hospital for the old lady who had a heart attack she didn't know her and she got herself killed by making dumb decisions. The kills were okay, the ending was okay, Sally's character was pointlessly thrown in and i truly did not care about her whatsoever she was pretty much throwaway. It's a fun time if you just want to get high and make fun of their dumb decisions and enjoy blood but as far as storyline it's convoluted. And let me just say i enjoy bad movies a lot and low rated movies but this one just felt unnecessary.",2022-02-21

I really want to discuss who's face he is wearing...but no spoilers! RidiculousI am giving 3 stars just for everyone who live streamed themselves getting chainsawed to death on the dumb bus.

"So bad it almost gave me a heart attack like the old lady in the orphanage. The story telling and character development is bad. Logic is nowhere to be seen. I get that horror movies need their characters to be dumbed down a little bit. But this movie makes the characters look like they have less IQ and common sense than a kid who eats glue at kindergarten.Also, the amount of wokeness in this film makes my head hurt. The directors kept inserting millenial BS that don't belong in the movie which made it even more terrible.",2022-02-23
"Awful, awful movie. The character Melody was the worst though by far and it only took a few minutes into the movie before I wanted to see her get chainsawed.The plot line was horrific. A few young 20-somethings buy a ghost town for who knows what. Within minutes of arriving in the town, they enter a building because they get offended by a confederate flag, and it turns out to be leather face's home where he lives with his mom.The kids are jerks to the mom and demand she leave her home, claiming they own the deed and not her (it turns out they're completely wrong). Anyway, the mom has some sort of heart attack and gets hauled away and ends up dying in leather face's arms on the way to the hospital. This naturally sets leather face off, and he begins his reign of terror.The rest of the movie plays out in a boring a non-entertaining way and unfortunately it takes forever for Melody to be killed. But when she is finally killed, you're happy both for her death and for the movie to finally be over. 1/10.",2022-02-19

"This was a pretty uneven film. While the gore and action was a pretty good modern take on the original with improved visuals and good blood effects, the actual plot and story are more maligned.The short summary is a group of young adults head to an abandoned town they have bought the deeds for and plan to sell at auction to breath life back into it. In the process they evict (wrongly) an old woman and her son, when the woman has a heart attack, dies and sends her son (revealed to be Leatherface) on a revenge tale through the town.Firstly, the setup is a little slow, it takes about 20 minutes to get to the first kills and the unleashing of Leatherface. While not terrible, the characters and story are fairly uninteresting and unlikeable which makes it hard to stay interested. However, there are good suspense segments and kills after this point which make the film a bit more interesting. Around this time, it is revealed one of the main characters survived a school shooting and carries survivors guilt and PTSD, with the current terror she's trapped in triggering these moments. It leaves her as a small bit of a damsel in distress, until the end where she finds her strength to take back control of her life. She is nearly killed and in the nick of time is saved by her sister with the chainsaw to ""kill"" the monster.There was a small side plot which felt like it would be more important, where Sally (lone survivor of 1978's Texas Chainsaw Massacre) was back to take revenge and put to bed the monster that has haunted her ever since. Except she is killed minutes after seeing Leatherface, and he survives the film so her contribution was meaningless.Like I have said, it's an uneven film. It has tension and suspense and also gore, but the story and characters are made secondary to it, which causes the film to suffer overall. Where you may be in it for gore, the characters don't make you want to stick around to see more. Hopefully, if they want to make sequels to this entry, they can take the criticisms and work on them to create a more effective film.",2022-02-21
"I was keen when I heard another Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie was being made. I finally had time to sit down and watch it...... The plot sounded great and sounded like it was going to be strong proper sequel to Tobe Hooper's original..... but it lacked character, it lacked a proper follow on story from the original.... it even lacked jump scares.Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 made in 1986 had more of a story and tried to follow on from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre then this new addition to the series of movies.I believe that this movie should have ended a different way. The original character from the original movie should have killed Leatherface and not the other way around.The movie was fully predictable aswell as to who is going to die and who would survive..... they killed off the strongest looking character during the film and qgain killed off the strongest character that had history with Leather face. I think that the film should have not been made in my honest opinion or it should have had a different storyline that actually ran directly from the original.",2022-02-21

"The movie was okay but the characters all made some bad decisions like hiding in a secure spot for 2 seconds then leaving and ending right in front of him.Also why the killer jumped out of the water like a mermaid. How is that possible???Then they finally have the opportunity to kill him but they slice him just to make him a little scratch? Wtf.However, the bus scene was dope but why nobody did something to stop him??? They were all filming instead like whats the point if your gonna die anyway? On another note, I would have drove the tesla myself to get out of there asap :0To conclude, some parts of the movie looked more like a comedy to me. HAHA the lady laying on the garbage bags shooting at him was rootless gotta love her for that!",2023-09-16
"I love this franchise but I was hesitatant knowing that it came from netflix and my fears were validated. It's quite sad that a company like netflix feels the need to be so politically motivated in their movies. Wokeness in movies can certainly ruin the movie, but anti-wokeness can also ruin a movie just as much and this movie has done just that. This movie is basically ""let's get a group of left wing young people and massacre them"". It just feels so politically motivated and completely pulls you out of the immersion. Additionally, this just feels like one of those netflix movies where they've got a great franchise and palmed it off to some newcomer writer and director who's creative extent of horror ends at gore and suspenseful music. The movie lacks any soul or personality, it's just bland. No horror here, just a boring Netflix movie that's trying to politically relate to viewers.",2022-02-19
"You've made the dumbest movie i've ever seen and that's saying alot. I guess i have to say more so the review posts, so i'll just harken back to my opening line here, since it pretty much says it all. You've made the dumbest movie i've ever seen and that's saying alot.",2022-02-24

"Finally some motivation behind that chainsaw that the viewers can empathize with! A fresh cast that didn't disappoint, a Leatherface unlike you've ever seen before, terrific homage to the original, and a PERFECT ending. Oh, did I mention that the kills will have you on your feet? I don't know how it could have been better.",2022-02-19
Dumb people show up doing a dumb thing and dumb stuff happens. So unbelievable that I can't even pretend that it makes sense. From beginning to end I just thought that it was ridiculous. Luckily it was only 80 minutes otherwise I wouldn't have been able to sit through it. Just a don't watch movie plain and simple.,2022-03-19
"To their credit, it could have done plenty worse but this latest addition overall brings nothing new to the table. Hipster woke young adults getting slaughtered. Thats it. You could replace Leatherface with virtually anyone else and the movie would have been more or less the same. Thats to say there isn't much to make you feel like you're watching an authentic Texas Chainsaw movie outside of the branding that was slapped onto a cookie cutter horror outline. The kills are fast pasted which kind of lessens the overall impact since they come off more as ""ok... sure"". The movie tries to cram in messages about gentrification, woke culture, guns, school shootings, etc. But they all fall flat and basically have zero impact; so why include them besides possibly to check items off a list of things the writers thought sounded profound. It's a passable popcorn movie if you're looking to kill time but this didn't NEED to be a Texas Chainsaw movie. Grab any bargain bin horror and you'll have virtually the same experience. Not unwatchable, it's a fine enough movie; but it's not great.",2022-02-18
"Tobe hooper's 1974 movie The Texas ChainSaw Massacre was a masterpiece. In 1986, Tobe Hooper tried his luck once again, but he was not successful. We can say that this movie made in 2022 is the second best movie of the series.. David Blue Garcia made a very, very good movie. .from now on,horror cinema has gained a new director.",2022-02-24

"This has become my favorite sequel to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre from 1974. It's not a good movie by any means, but it's such a fun time watching old man Leatherface slaughter countless annoying teens, with one likable, strong final girl to root for. In other words, a good old-fashioned slasher! With not much else unfortunately. But, there's some great gore, respectable callbacks to the original film, and good performances all around. I do have some issues with this installment, but everything I enjoy about the movie outweighs what I don't.Overall, I ended up having a real good time with this film! A lot more so than I expected. If you're a horror fan, and more specifically a fan of slashers, then I highly recommend checking this entry out.",2022-08-26
"The slasher genre has a fairly low bar, be big, loud, violent and dumb, This flick does one better (worse) in being big and dumb, loud and dumb, violent and dumb and finally dumb and dumb ... and somehow, almost no fun at all. Credit where its due the kills are gnarly and all look great and the performances are ernest with the material provided, the poster shot of leather face poking his face out of the sunflowers is at the same time haunting and wasted on a flash cut. In a genre of dumb characters existing for no other reason than being slaughtered these are the dumbest, and all too often exist in the world of the promethius school of running away from things in a straight line. The first 30 mins offer up the best kills of the show, the second thirty has some violent fun ruined by the preposterously bad decisiins of the cast we couldn't care less about and the final 20 mins are nonsense with all the best violence out of the way and characters we don't care about maybe making it out. Even the fan sevice is minimal. Looks good, feels bad.",2023-10-12

Not a worthy remake. Make new original movies instead or all these garbage remakes. Why do people continue to remake movies over and over again? Could not get into this movie at all.,2022-02-27
"So, I did not have any expectations for this film, which is good because I'm not disappointed that I didn't enjoy it.There's just too much wrong with it. I can't tell you what the first act is about. I can't tell you why characters do what they do, or even what they're doing. I can't tell you, on a thematic level, what this film is trying to say.This film has a ton of gore. So if that's what you're interested in, cool. You'll likely have a good time. But don't expect a simple popcorn flick, because it never truly leans into it. It bounces between serious and silly, never landing on either.It also looks like it was filmed on a studio lot, so I was never truly immersed in the story. The leads are confusing, too. I still have no idea who the protagonist is.The third act is ridiculous. Way over the top and completely jumps the shark.The film itself pays homage to many horror greats including the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Shining. It also borrows heavily from 2018's Halloween, but it's nowhere near as successful.I love the concept behind this franchise, but I don't think we've truly seen what it's capable of. Worse, this film reminds me of how the slasher genre nearly died off entirely in the late 80s/early 90s.",2022-02-19
"Not as bad as 3D, but pretty close. I think they should just stop making these movies. They're just made for money and fail to capture any atmosphere of the original masterpiece. That being said, this movie does give you some kids to not like, some cool kills, and a decent ending scene. There is no originality, and bringing the Sally Hardesty character back just to have her say dumb stuff and then thrown in the trash,(Literally thrown in the trash) is kind of a smack in the face. I don't need to know anything else about the original final girl after the last shots of the original. That's what makes it so scary. How do they miss this, every producer thinks explaining the unexplained helps their movie and in reality it just makes it less frightening.",2022-06-02
"Another failed attempt at keeping a dead franchise going. How in 2022 are we still rebooting/remaking films with no originality or substance. This movie is so uninspired, packed full of cliches, moronic character choices, pointless subplots and hyper stylized gore. If you're looking for a brainless watch then maybe this'll do it for you, but it just didn't work for me. I was just waiting for it to end and even when it did, the ending was a huge eye roll.",2022-02-20

I'm sure we all love a little foreshadowing but jeez... however I'm writing this at 3am cause I was awake and it was new to watch.",2022-02-21
"In the wonderful world of horror films, there are just some franchises that everyone has heard about. From young to old it matters not because these franchises set the tone for horror films in the future. Some of those franchises include, but are not limited to Friday The 13th, Nightmare On Elm Street, Halloween, Chucky, Hellraiser, Leprechaun, The Exorcism, and of course TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE,This is not to say that all of these films are massive hits, or have amazing storytelling, but rather that we know them and we respect them for what they are, which is pillars of the horror genre.If you as a writer, director, producer, cinematographer, production designer, key grip, gaffer, make-up artist, etc. Get to work on these films in the modern age the very least that you can do is respect the franchise and and serve it justice by making an great work of art.This filth that is the 2022 Texas Chainsaw Massacre should have never made it out of pre-production with the terrible writing. The actors were great, the cinematography was excellent, the score was very nice, but the writing was TRASH.I can suspend the fact that Leather face is darn near 70 years old, as this is supposed to be a direct sequel to the first TCM. However, why does a woman who waits 50 years to come face to face with the person who killed her friends have to give a victory speech?Once she saw him in the room and didn't immediately end him with a shotgun, but instead let him walk right past her to continue his reign of terror on the remaining survivors I could no longer enjoy the film. I don't mind suspending belief for the supernatural, or paranormal events that happen in films.However, I can never suspend my belief for STUPIDITY. There was no reason for her to die at all! She had the golden opportunity to kill him after 30 years, even after her victory speech and she still ended up dying! Why?This is a direct result of BAD WRITING! No excuse for it. It's not a school essay that had to be completed over the weekend. It's a storied franchise that has been around since the freaking 70s for crying out loud. Forget the ending where Leather face miraculously rises from the dead and punches his 70 year old fist through the car window and grabs the girl and decapitates her. I'll chalk that up to horror movie magic.But why was leather face not immediately shot in the back of the head as soon as she walked into the room and saw him sitting there? You don't advance a story with stupidity because it takes the viewers out of the movie and makes it IMPOSSIBLE to cheer for the good guys when the good guys are behaving the the dumb guys.Find another way to advance the story other than her wanting him to remember who she is after 50 years before she finally kills him. It's bad writing and a disgrace to the franchise! Imagine when the next TCM comes out in 2-3 years. Do you think a majority of people who say this hot feces soup will watch the next one? I'll let you answer that!",2022-03-27
"Well that's time if my life I'm not getting back.On a positive note there is some halfway decent gore but...
Somehow leatherface has been keeping a low profile for the last 50 years, putting him presumable at the mark of around 80 years old. He's been living quietly with a little old foster mum who is probably 20 years younger than him.Yet when needed to he can dust off that chainsaw and shred the pesky woke yuppies like a deranged nutter who is a quarter of his age!Moving on to aforementioned woke yuppies! Well I can't say I was overly rooting for any of them to achieve anything beyond an imaginative death scene. Not the warmest bunch.Sally turns up as a tough old broad who has kept herself alive with the sole desire of killing leatherface. Well let's say that's a bit underwhelming too!Watch only if extremely bored!",2022-02-23
"Story - weak.Acting - sub-par.Cinematography - not bad.Narration - weak.Antagonist design - good.Other characters - weak.I still prefer the 2013 adaptation to this one. It was more gripping and bigger per se. This movie did not make sense really, no characters had any story and aubstance.",2022-02-19
"Its fine. I mean, the only actual point of most horror movies is to be disturbing, scary and intimidating, and this one sure is scary. Or it depends on if you find gore scary, because the only way this is scary is the gore. Leatherface literally cuts necks with a chainsaw, stabs a guy with the guy's own bone, smashes a literal head with a hammer and peels skin off a lady's face. Nothing is left to the viewer's imagination.It's the type of a horror movie that is scary when you watch it, but it doesn't stay in your head haunting you for a long time, or at all. I don't recommend watching it with your 5 year old for a fun family movie night thought, maybe not even 12 year old.",2023-04-18
"I did not go in with high expectations, but i did go in with specific expectations. And all those were met. I think it was a fresh modern feel with all the hipsters coming into town trying to change everything and it gave you a sense of empathy for Leatherface almost until he went bananas, oh my god this Leatherface felt so evil compared to 3D. It actually made him scary again. Most of the shots they put him in actually creeped me the F out. The cinematography in this one is done really well, up there with the original and the 03 remake and probably my personal favorite in that regard. The kills were awesome, really different from anything we've seen in the franchise so far, coming from someone who mained Leather in MK10 it feels like they definitely took some notes from the game, he was way more smart with how he used his weapons. I don't think him being smarter or as a lot are saying ""trying to turn him into Michael Myers or Jason Vorhees"" ruined the character for me because i mean its been 50 years since the original, there's absolutely no way his brain and thought process haven't changed even just a little bit. The bus scene was top tier, it felt like i was watching something that could very well show up on the news one of these days. Also, i don't care what anyone says, i know it was forced but the ""Try anything and you're cancelled"" line really made me get excited for what was about to happen and i think anyone who gets riled up at that line is just cause it struck a nerve with them lol. I think if you're a TCM fan you'll like it. If not, you'll probably just jump on the bandwagon and trash it.They definitely kind of wasted Sally, wish she could have had a little more screen time and some one on one time with Lila because of them both being survivors and having that survivors guilt of them feeling like they should have died with their friends, cause that's what this movie is focused on, it's about dealing with that trauma and instead of running and letting it follow you or ""haunt you"" the rest of your life, facing it head on. (Both mentally and literally.) The ending was great, predictable, but great. Leather holding her sisters head and almost mocking her with it as she drove away was amazing. Over all the movie is pretty good, i enjoyed it immensely, there was moments that made my jaw drop and moments that made me go ""lol wait what"" not bad by any means but not the greatest ether. Definitely deserves a sequel, maybe now that the rights aren't being thrown around during production the next one can have some proper care and treatment and really be something great. Personally i'd like to find out what happened w Drayton after the original. Solid pick for horror movie night. 8/10 stars for me.",2022-03-04
"There is not much to say about this one. It is another reboot of a popular horror franchise and as usual the tropes are therefore here.The setup of the story is just unrealistic, the choices made by the characters are somewhat questionable and of course Leatherface after being away for 50 years can still survive everything and kill everyone he sees with his trustworthy companion, the chainsaw.Overall, there is not much here in depth or story but it makes it up for in the gore department. So if you like horror this can be a somewhat fun watch and its runtime is fortunately not that long.",2022-03-15
I can honestly appreciate this for the satirical value but really it was a reach ever for a slasher film. I was disappointed in how choppy the story line was. The mask was honestly the only scary thing here and a few unsettling moments of background info but overall this was a waste of what could have been a great movie.,2022-05-28
"The gore and kills in this movie were the only standout positive things about it. The script was bad and not believable at all, with amateur dialogue that just needs to stop getting movies greenlit at some point. The actors sucked, but of course the script hindered them. The main sister was just plain ugly and purposely not trying to be attractive. That may sound sexist but this is a slasher film, one of the main components of which is the satisfaction of seeing attractive people get murdered. The other sister looked way too much like Arya Stark; maybe that's unfair to her but they could have done her hair differently so she wasn't SO much like Arya.I saw that the movie had a 4.9 on IMDb before I watched it, so I kept that in mind while grading the movie throughout. Before Sally from the original film showed up to ""save the day,"" I would have given the movie a 6 because the kills were truly delightful and some made me laugh out loud hard. Making me laugh during gore is a good thing, because it's such a horrible thing to comprehend in reality. But in a movie it should be gratuitous and over-the-top so that it comes off as creative and satisfying. Most of us will never experience these things in real life, so movie gore should both satisfy our curiosity and reinforce that we really don't want to see this stuff ever outside of fiction.So we're at a 6 rating, but then EVERYTHING that Sally does is so inconceivably unintelligent that you want to start yelling at and throwing things at the screen. The overused horror movie clichés (the stalling tactics that typical horror movie victims seem to always employ when you should just shoot the head immediately and then figure out the rest) that plague her every decision are so unbelievable when you consider that this woman has been haunted by Learherface for nearly 50 years. Yes, he killed your friends, and yes, you should want your revenge for that to be specifically satisfying. But you know that Leatherface is not a talker. All he did was make whiny noises in the original film while the rest of his family (except wonderful old Grandpa) was able to talk and had some flashes of comprehension. I haven't seen any of the other movies that her character appeared in, but you have to grasp at some point that this dude is damn-near impossible to kill. I would have brought missiles and I'm not exaggerating. It's just that this movie's Sally was completely lacking what a mildly intelligent person with some semblance of a plan to defeat an incredibly strong and durable enemy would do. And that's just not believable to me.Sally is not alone. The idiot sisters were always hiding instead of running and in 2022 everyone knows that's a dumb move. Sure, a lot of people are just not very intelligent, but survival instinct naturally kicks in and helps you make better decisions to ensure your survival. They knew the stories about Leatherface. I don't see how at any point they could honestly conceive that they could outsmart him or outmaneuver him.So the final, loooooong sequence, of these three characters thinking they killed Leatherface, him coming back, then attacking him again, then him coming back again (even doing the most physically impossible dolphin impression that just made me want to hit my skull until the mental pain of witnessing raw, unadulterated stupidity went away), and so on and so forth nosedived this movie's rating to a 3 for me. Then the final scene before the credits was moderately satisfying enough to earn a final grade of 4.Bottom line, it is an undeniable affront to people who love horror movies that this film was made. You just have to wonder if nobody involved in the making of the movie ever raised their hand and pointed out what was so clearly wrong with it. Shame on Netflix for green lighting this dud. The need for content should never outweigh the importance of quality content.",2022-02-27
"So, nobody has a problem with the fact that Leather face had to be around 20 years old. Fifty years have passed..so that would make,him 70 years old. He sure didn't look 70 to.me.",2022-03-05
"The only reason I gave this movie 5 stars, is because of the over the top gore. The bus scene at the end didn't make me regret spending 1hr 23min watching this poorly written, bloody mess (no pun intended) of a movie. I believe this is the 2nd or 3rd time they made a ""direct sequel"" to the original movie in this franchise. They should probably just stop at this point. There was no character development at all, and you didn't care about any of them either (even the two sisters who were the final girls at the end). I still don't understand why they were in that deserted town in Texas to begin with Were they buying it, so they can use it to film content for their social media accounts? Where did that random bus load of people come from? Did Leatherface call Grubhub and ask for victims to be delivered to him? Oh and apparently he stores his trusty chainsaw inside the wall of his bedroom and has to use a sledge hammer to bust it out (John Wick style) since he's now ""out of retirement"". But at least his murderous rampage is caused by his Mom dying, and not a dog (that is in no way a dig towards the John Wick movies. I freakin love those movies! They are so much fun). I will say though, the guy who tells Leatherface ""You better watch it bro, or your gonna be cancelled"" as him and others are filming LF on their phones, made me laugh. So I guess only 95% of the writing was bad. Oh and if I ever buy a Tesla one day, I'm gonna be sure to put the auto pilot feature on, so can hang out of the sun roof and watch a murderous made man swing a chainsaw in the air, as the car slowly drives me away to safety. That was clearly a nod to the ending of the original classic....but you know...updated for modern times. So in all, this isn't a total mess, but close to it. If you want to see some cool gore, then this is for you. If you want to see a faithful sequel to the original, get in a Tesla, hit the autopilot feature, and get as far away as possible from this. In my opinion, the only good movies in this whole franchise are TCM (1974), TCM 2 (1986), TCM (2003), and TCM: The Beginning (2006). Skip the others, and go check out Freddy, Jason, or Michael instead. They're much cooler slashers.",2022-02-20
"Anyone who's giving this a good review is not a fan of the originals or TCM in general.The first half of the film was greatly paced, with great built up tension and great kills, and then as soon as Sally's character comes into the film, it just flatlines.I don't understand why they brought back the character of Sally? It just doesn't make any logical sense. They ruined every single part of her legacy and bad arse final girl status from the original. Scream honoured their legacy characters in the new film and this basically made a mockery out of their one and only legacy character, the same character they marketed all over the film since announcing it. It would have been better if they'd just not included it.None of the characters are memorable. I finished it less than an hour ago and I can't remember any of their names. As soon as I got to the final part of the film, I couldn't care less who lived and died because I found them both so unlikeable for many reasons.Texas Chainsaw Massacre has a lot of bad films in its franchises but this film takes the cake as the worst. Leatherface live on Instagram? It's worse than Michael being on reality TV in Resurrection. Pure cringe fest. I didn't think it was possible to damage the franchise more than the previous instalments did, but I was wrong.",2022-02-19
"Waited the whole movie for the worse character to get killed. And after tirelessly waiting the whole movie, he finally killed off the worse character at the end.",2022-08-22
"If I rated this movie simply on special effects and gore I'd give it a strong 7/8 easy, but I'm not. There's many details that make this incarnation of TCM feel sloppy and disconnected from what the original was. Our one connection to the original is supposed to have become a hardened Texas ranger that's been searching for Learherface for 40 years. We only learn that in an early scene but they missed an opportunity here. This woman has devoted her life to looking for a killer but we don't really know why she can't find him. How could he have eluded her when we learn that he's been living with a woman in a ghost town orphanage. How did he come to live there? And if the woman has aged why isn't he an old man? At least in the new Halloween movies we are given that Michael Myers is some kind of supernatural force. But Learherface is a 60 or 70 year old man that can run around like he's still 25-35. If this is to be a true sequel you should try to make it somewhat believable. This version has too many plot holes, and it lacks any character developments and it was extremely predictable. Stick with the original. At least Tobe Hooper could tell a story.",2022-02-20
"The film goes absolutely nowhere and almost every character is excruciatingly annoying.Leatherface is by far the character with the most charisma, likeability, and has the best lines (yes, he has none)",2022-03-19
"Have you ever seen a Horror movie where one particular character is so painfully stupid that you actually want them to die? Well just about every character in this movie is so moronic, Leatherface gradually becomes the hero of his own movie each time he mows somebody down. Richter was the only character I actually came to like and I wish we saw more of him.The movie has some gnarly kills and one or two genuinely hilarious moments, but that's about it. It's oversaturated with cheap looking CGI blood, the acting is amateur and the characters are detestable. The ending was predictable and the school shooting development plot had no relevance and went absolutely nowhere. The decision to recast Sally and include her in the movie felt like the filmmakers spat in Marilyn Burns' grave, because they bastardized every aspect of her iconic character and she becomes without doubt the most annoying and obnoxious character in the movie for absolutely no reason at all.Give this movie a pass, and just wait for James A. Janisse to cover the kills on the Kill Count, where you'll undoubtedly get far more entertainment value than wasting your time watching this mess of a movie.",2022-02-20
"There were multiple instances throughout the movie I felt like I was watching Halloween. The idea to have their own ""Laurie"" was more corny than anything else. I was impressed with the graphics but besides the gore the movie was a huge letdown. I was very excited to see this movie Netflix produced as the last few Netflix original films were pretty impressive. Needless to say TCM has been yet another film to get redone multiple times just digging a deeper hole for its name. You can only remake a movie once or twice tops before it just becomes a bore.",2022-02-19

I would like to watch a horror movie this decade that isn't 90% bashing politics. Aside from that the actual movie is bad too. Terrible characters that make dumb decisions, horrible movie logic. I can tell the script was written by a 60-year-old who uses trigger words to captivate a teenage audience, but you need to have a somewhat good movie in the first place. There's literally about 4-5 ""final"" fight sequences until Leatherface goes and hides and we then have to sit through another ""final"" fight scene until the producers have decided they have enough footage to get it over the time for it to actually be considered a movie.In short, don't watch this movie. You will spend the entire movie complaining about the logic and how long it has left, and you will never get those 90 minutes back.",2022-03-21
"Only bad. The story was boring, the actors were just bad. You shouldn't film something like that, without the name nobody would look at it. You don't miss anything if you only look at the wall for 90 minutes, it's about as exciting. You should never let the producer make a film again, just a waste of money.",2022-03-01
"As a direct continuation of the franchise's first film (1974), TCM gathered huge expectations from fans who expected a script befitting the end of the old film. This piece, however, would serve much better as a solo than a sequel.We left the first movie with final girl Sally Hardesty escaping Bubba (leatherface) by climbing onto a hitchhiker truck in the middle of the road. The 2022 sequel picks up years after the first massacre, which became an iconic testimony in Texas, even without local sheriffs finding the killer.The first mistake made by the film, in the script, is not explaining Bubba's appearance at the orphanage, away from his family and out of action for more than 20 years. The last time we saw him, he was still in the bed of the cannibal Sawyer family, so this change of location is odd for the viewer familiar with the original. As a result, none of the iconic characters other than Bubba and Sally appear in the sequel.The second mistake was turning the iconic Bubba into a reincarnation of Jason Voorhees. You see, leatherface has a special feature that makes the viewer empathize with the character: he has no sense of reality outside the Sawyer house, and he faithfully believes that what he's doing is right. Behind the mask, Bubba has a childlike attitude, of a child who has never been able to get out of the cage created by his parents.This feature is very well explored in other films in the franchise, such as in the second, in which Leatherface has a romantic interest in the protagonist Vanita Brock, who was kind enough to soften the murderer's heart.Anyway, now that we've established that the film is bad as a direct sequel, precisely because it has no narrative connection to the original, can we assess whether the film holds up as a solo?TCM is being slaughtered by the current critics, who instead of judging it for its continuity errors, judge it for being a love letter to the slashers of the 90's. The film is a gorefest, filled with bloody moments and without worrying about realism when you want to show raw violence on screen.The characters, as characteristic of every film of the category, do not have much history or built personality. He quickly introduces all the main ones to, in the twenty minutes of film, start the massacre and keep this violent rhythm until the end. As much as I like it when movies add depth to characters, that's not a slasher's goal, as the only character we follow through to the end is the iconic ""final girl"".That said, I believe that the few moments of story and feelings given to the main characters (Bubba, Sally and the two sisters) were enough to develop a small plot involving the survivor's trauma - which was wonderfully played by Olwen Fouéré (Sally ).Now, about the movie's antagonist and killer - leatherface. By dedicating itself to being a love letter to the old slashers, TCM removes all the hallmarks of the much-loved leatherface. He ends up becoming a little mix of the original assassins; the characteristic appearance and bearing of Michael Myers (Halloween); similar story and motivation to Jason Voorhees (Friday 13th).While some solo scenes in the film show a bit of the empathetic character of the original franchise, they aren't enough to build an iconic profile like the first film. In addition to the famous ""Killer Doesn't Die"" trope, which makes the ending frustrating.As a slasher film, TCM manages to hold its own, having incredible and bloody cinematography, but as a sequel and narrative, it fails in many ways.",2022-02-26

Or simply can't be motivated enough to find something better.The school shooting survivor who I expected to be the main focus of majority of screen time, didn't do anything special like I expected. I mean, she survived twice, for what? I wasn't really rooting for any of them to survive. And if that's the case they may as well go down in style.The gore scenes left much to be desired. Especially the bus scene, it was over too fast. It could of had some great cinematography.By the way what's with all the broken legs?The saving grace was the ending scene when her head was cut off.",2022-03-11

"Texas Chainsaw Massacre has always been considered the movie that pioneered slashers but when you look at genre defining movies such as Friday the 13th and Halloween it doesnt really fit. Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2022) on the other hand is an all out slasher movie with tons of blood, gore, creative kills, fantastic visuals and Leatherface has a lot more victims this time around than any other chainsaw film before it.THIS MOVIE DOES NOT FOCUS ON THE LORE IN OTHER MOVIES INCLUDING THE FIRST....and thats ok.A lot of complaints ive seen have accused this movie of disrespecting the original by ignoring the original family and barely revisiting the events of the first film. While this is true, why do we need to? Die hard fans of the the series have surely seen the first movie. We all know the story so why get hung up on the events of another movie instead of just focusing on the events in this one?NETFLIX'S TEXAS CHAINSAW CHANGES THE DYNAMICThe new movie is a revenge movie through and through and works to make you hate the main characters. If you're a fan of Leatherface and just want to see a bunch of people get destroyed by a chainsaw weilding, dead skin mask wearing cannibal then THIS MOVIE IS FOR YOU.Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2022) has its flaws lets be honest, its no Texas Chainsaw Massacre part 2 (1986) but overall the movie is a fun, bloody good time and well worth the watch.",2022-02-22
"The rating of this movie definitely could've done better but that's not my biggest issue with it. What really bothers me about this movie and made me come straight to review it here which I don't do often is how awful the reactions of the people on the bus are, for example the first woman to see Dante walk out of the house before he dies, barely shows any emotion at all. Even when leather face is on the bus, killing everyone in front of them. This is a horror movie so maybe try and look a little horrified? Maybe even a scream of terror would be a bit more convincing instead of just looking put off. The main actors, and CGI is what really carry this movie to a four-star and not one.",2022-12-15

"You don't even need to watch this to know this is not a deep psychological thriller - and that's fine. To me, this was a great watch for this Halloween season. Some good jump scares, there's an implied narrative on technology and society, and the production is solid. The set up is a little far fetched, but that didn't get in the way for me - and hey, we're talking popcorn slasher flick here! This does a great job paying homage to the original as well as other movies that followed in the wake of the original. And the ending made it all worthwhile!

Being a proud horror nut, I found this film to be the second best entry to the franchise. I have a feeling people judged the political undertones, which added to the story in a time when culture clash is very necessary. I can see that people thought less of this film maybe because of its cult-like-CA weirdos are welcome to stay in Texas, but leave your elite-thinking-social-media hat at the door. I don't know.

Everything about the movie was amazing...the music, the special effects, the story, the writing. It wasn't a stupid storyline, and all the moving parts worked very well in this film. Kudos to the writers, directors, and producers of this film. Keep them coming....you definitely have raised the bar on how to make a horror film work and scare your audience. I can't wait to see what you do next....a Freddy Krueger or Poltergeist reboot would be amazing!!",2022-02-20
"This movie felt like a random Slasher movie with a Texas Chainsaw Massacre skin over it. Leatherface is not Leatherface in this movie except when he puts on someone's face who's not his movie and when he holding a chainsaw. Leatherface was not raised in an orphanage. He only cares about his family and has some major mommy issues. Also, the most important aspect of the best TCM movies is his relationshion with his family. There's none of that in this new movie.Sally's inclusion in this movie is useless and quite frankly very disrespectful to the original movie and actress. You could cut the Sally character in it and have Richter do the exact same thing she did and it would be more acceptable.The only good things I can say about the movie are that the photography, athough a bit too clean for TCM movie, the main actors are pretty good, not so much the supporting cast, and the gore is superb. By far the best thing about this movie is the kills. The movie is brutal, quite cold at times and surprising.The bus scene is both a highlight and a lowlight of the movie. It's bloody, tense and insane. It's also dumb as hell. Nobody tries to stop Leatherface at all. They just accept their death and wait to be slaughtered. No one tries to open a window, or even break it until the very end when Leatherface can easily catch them.I was going to rate the movie 4/10, but then the very last scene happened and it left me laughing out loud. Ended up rating it a 3/10. What a good looking piece of trash.",2022-02-19

"Dear Mr. David Blue Garcia. Cancer is a disease caused when cells divide uncontrollably and spread into surrounding tissues. Cancer is caused by changes to DNA. Most cancer-causing DNA changes occur in sections of DNA called genes. These changes are also called genetic changes.In the United States in 2018, 1,708,921 new cancer cases were reported and 599,265 people died of cancer. For every 100,000 people, 436 new cancer cases were reported and 149 people died of cancer. 2018 is the latest year for which incidence data are available.Smoking can cause cancer and then block your body from fighting it: Poisons in cigarette smoke can weaken the body's immune system, making it harder to kill cancer cells. When this happens, cancer cells keep growing without being stopped. Poisons in tobacco smoke can damage or change a cell's DNA.Smoking is at least as dangerous as a guy who's wandering around with a big gun.Thank you very much.",2022-02-19

"I was hoping this would be a good Friday night guilty pleasure movie, but instead kept pausing it on Netflix to see how many painful minutes were left.You don't actually want any of the ""protagonists"" to live. I put quotes around protagonist because it's arguable who the protagonist really is, the main characters or Leatherface. I ended up rooting for Leatherface.Soon enough a bus full of influencers arrive but they probably should have spent less time on their phones and learn some practical skills like how to slide or kick open a bus window. They. All. Die.The writers also really wanted to pull a Halloween reboot/Jaime Lee Curtis trick and bring back Sally from the original TCM with absolutely no success. Sally has been waiting 50 years to kill Leatherface and has him dead bang unarmed sitting on a bed with a shotgun pointed at his head but gets butthurt and lets him go because he ""didn't remember"" her. Then decides she's going to ""make you remember me"" after he's rearmed himself with his chainsaw. She dies too.I could go on and on about this load of cinematic garbage but instead I'll just give my suggestion. Don't waste your time. It's 80 minutes of your life you can't get back. Go learn some practical skills instead like how to open a window.",2022-02-19

Halloween is the best movie ever. I will give who made by Netflix who stole some ideas from other horror movies is half star but it only one star for half star.

Where was the creativity in this? Where was the characters back story? The big tell all of leatherface history? Ntm the original story isn't even in Texas.I can't recommend this film.",2022-02-23
"Story: The story is a disappointment because instead of making it their own movie and changing Leatherface they take the Original Story of the first movie and then Change Leatherface. They added Sally in and really for no reason plus it wasn't the original actress so that's in bad taste even if she did die in 2014. So the original story should've never been added in, it does nothing for the movie.Kills: Now if you enjoyed the 2003 Reboots Lingering shots on the kills especially with the Chainsaw then you might now want to watch this movie. Most kills are quick slashes and jump cuts to other people or the main 2 people. At the end I had hope someone was going to get a nice 5-10 second shot of a chainsaw going through them but then it jump cuts to the main 2 protagonists.Atmosphere: If you liked the unsettling atmosphere in the 2003 reboot well again it doesn't have that. It also doesn't have the house messy with animal skulls like in the original movie.I bring up the 2003 reboot a lot because for me it did a lot right. It changed the story made it it's own thing and then delivered a unsettling atmosphere mixed with lingering shots of the kills to bring extra gruesomeness.But the Netflix version does nothing absolutely nothing for the franchise.",2022-02-20
"I usually don't review movies but this movie was so garbage i had to let it out. First of all, the Chainsawer would be atleast 66 years old acc. To the information they gave. And how he is that strong??? And also the sole survivor of the earlier massacre event Sally, her role was Dumb, i mean it initially felt like she would have some importance but she was the weakest link like she had a very nice chance to kill him but just stood there and after all these girls she can't even arrange for a proper gun which is effective atleast.... meanwhile dies while laying in garbage bags. Also, Melody thought she killed the Chainsawer meanwhile she only most likely hurt his lower jaw and he emerged later and mutilated her head. That was so dumb, can't that girl take some inspiration from how the Chainsawer brutally kills it's victims making sure they don't survive and do the same with him? The movie is so dumb and don't even make no sense.",2022-02-24

I don't see were some people find this movie bad. I love the old school blood spill which there is plenty love how it kind of bulid up to Leatherface having enough of strangers trying to take over a town were he really been living a quiet life. Also its good to see a horror movie that dont just rely on sex in fact i like that it has no sex at all.

With that being said i thought this release was a fun and gory slasher. There were some decent jump scares, and some surprising and unexpected gore. Lets face it.

"The trouble with this movie is none of the characters are compelling and the plot is very disjointed. Too many plot threads with too much focus on uninteresting characters and not enough focus on the interesting ones - Leatherface and Sally and the woman calling herself his mother.I would junk the boring busload of millennial stereotypes entirely and build the entire movie around Sally's character and Leatherface. I would expand the mother character and give Leatherface a new family.Here's the plot: Sally has been hunting Leatherface obsessively for 50 years. She finds him in Harlow. But it's not what she expects. Leatherface has a new, normal name. He isn't dangerous or violent anymore. He is essentially a gentle old man whose mind has not developed beyond the trauma of his childhood. He has changed because he was found and taken in by a kind and generous family after his birth family was killed. Trouble is, the family knows about Leatherface's violent past, and they've kept it secret from the rest of the town. So now, faced with this new reality, what does Sally do?I would love to see that movie. Because horror is not really about hyper realistic gore effects, although that can be a fun part of it. It's really about the horrors of human existence. And there is nothing more horrific than the reality of what we as humans do to one another as a result of the moral lessons we continually fail to learn.So will Sally learn those lessons this time? Will the town if they learn the truth? And then you get the meaning and the tension that this movie really needed.",2022-02-21

The only positive in this movie is the actors. Dante and Mel were pretty good actors. The story though 🍅🍅🍅. My thing is I hate horror movies where characters try so hard to get killed.

"So, it's 50 years after the original, and as near as makes no difference 70 year old Leatherface can still swing his chainsaw and run like he's in his 20's.It's still a very sporadic showing of what he's capable of with his mind blowing aggression and strength though. Snaps a guys arm no problem with one hand, takes down a gun wielding Texas mechanic (the films only likeable character), yet struggles on 3/4 occasions to take down the detestable Gen Z Mel, by far the worst character in the film, yet somehow the main protagonist.......Failed nostalgia attempt, a la Halloween 2018, bringing back the original surviver, who somehow survives a chainsaw through her entire body for a good 10 seconds, gets thrown across a road and still has the strength to load, cock and fire a 12 gauge pump action shotgun......The whole bus, Instagram ""you'll get cancelled bro"" scene is enough to highlight the shocking, abysmal state society finds itself in these days and gives rise for one to celebrate when our OAP chainsaw loving mad man wipes out an entire bus load of Gen Z's.It's not a great movie. It's a confusing one at best.I will however recommend it people purely for the fact I cheered when Mel got decapitated at the end a did myself a little dance just like Leatherface!If you want to watch good Chainsaw Massacre films, stick with Tobe Hooper's Original or Marcus Nispel's 2003 remake, both far superior to this.",2022-02-21

Although I understand how characters in a film like this would act, it had me disappointed and embarrassed at every decision the characters made. You would think Sally would have been slightly more relevant in the plot but she basically got wiped out 20 seconds after seeing leatherface.On a more positive note, the gore was decent and the film was enjoyable to watch and laugh at. But that's as far as my positivity goes. Script was as cheesy as this review title and I expect the cast could've done better if they were directed by someone with more experience.3/10.",2022-02-19
You know I really wanted to like this movie and I did to a degree. I felt there was a lot of overacting and many scenes the storyline was a little thin but the action in Gore was appropriate to my expectations. Frankly I felt this was a very forced reboot was an interesting twist in ties to the original however Hollywood has a lot of work to do if it really wants to attract genuine response to its horror films and franchises. Not exactly a waste of your time. Interesting if it was a standalone movie...not as good when linked with a franchise.,2022-02-19
"David Blue Garcia's Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2022) attempts to reboot the franchise by putting a ""Gen Z"" twist on the formula. While there are some interesting horror elements at play, this film, like many other horror reboots as of late, suffers from an underdeveloped script.The Positives:1) Colin Stetson's soundtrack is fantastically terrifying-it's macabre, it's primordial, it's chaotic, and yet it still retains Stetson's signature sound. The use of ""Every Last One"" during the bus scene (as shown in the trailer) actually chilled me to the bone. Stetson's score elevates the film considerably, perhaps more than it deserves.2) Fans of gore are sure to appreciate its use in this movie, as there are some creatively brutal kills on display.3) As a popcorn slasher, it does its job. There are some interesting shots here and there. Too bad the film's script wasn't better.The Negatives:1) My biggest problem with this film is the characters. They are severely underdeveloped, and come off as spoiled, rich a-holes, with no discernable personality traits. Perhaps this was intentional, but it just didn't work for me. I appreciate they tried to make us sympathize with Leatherface, but the unbelievability of his super strength (especially at his old age of 70+) prevented me from seeing any semblance of humanity in his character.2) The inclusion of Sally Hardesty is strange to me. On one hand, it feels like they were trying to do right by the original in bringing her back. However, the film's script is so shlocky that I can't help but think she was only included to sucker fans into thinking this film would be a return to form. While the new actress who plays Sally, Olwen Fouéré, is good, her character is given nothing to do. She has no character arc whatsoever. By taking her out of the film, more time could have been spent developing the other characters or vise-versa.3) I was not a fan of the ""Gen Z"" approach to this movie. In terms of story, its inclusion felt forced to try and appeal to wider audiences, without understanding what audiences actually want. Everything here feels too refined and modern. What made the original good was its raw, barbaric tone, not a bunch of hipsters filming Leatherface on their phones; it borders on parody.While the film is entertaining, I was more often than not frustrated during my experience. Leatherface comes off like a caricature of his past self, adding nothing new to the franchise's legacy. Here's hoping the next one will be better!",2022-02-18
"Probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my 40 something years, the only good parts was in the last 30 seconds just right before the ending credits.Heads up.. if you like movies were everyone makes the wrong decisions said the wrong words and follow their wrong instincts this movie if for you,
if you watch a movie expecting to be frustrated and stressed this movie is for you.I liked the characters the location the acting was average but i just can't stand the idiocy I just wish movie producers stop making the characters like idiots.",2022-02-24

"This is the new 2021 adaptation of a movie that originally came out in 1974 inspired from a man that lived in the 1950's. As a Gen Z, I think the characters were a stereotypical portrayal of the younger generation, but I know some people that act like so it is somewhat believable. The main problem is that these characters have little to no depth. One of the main characters was a school shooting survivor. The movie showed parallels between a real massacre and the fictional one on screen. Leatherface isn't just a fairytale or a killer that exists only in movies, real monsters like him do exist in our society. They had a lot of potential to go deeper in the storyline with this, but they really didn't. Leatherface also has no depth, he is also somehow alive 50+ years later and still running around like he's max. 50 years old. He is also invincible, taking 2 shotgun wounds like a champ. The original leatherface is lost. He is no longer the real psycho but a supernatural force. It had a good amount of scares. Another common critique was about the survivor from the original movie coming back for revenge, and being an idiot and not shooting leatherface while he was sitting there unarmed, but the point was that she had a deep hatred for him and wanted to see him suffer for killing four of her close friends, and for torturing her. She wanted him to say ""yes I remember you"" but he never did. She wanted that satisfaction but she never got it.",2022-03-19

"There is only one cool thing they did in this movie. All the ""hillbilly"" or ""hick"" characters actually turned out to be better people than the main characters which I thought was interesting. The kids we follow are jerks who constantly are obnoxious and unlikable. The store owner was nice to them, truck guy calmly explained himself to them, the police didn't harass them and even gave them their card if they needed help, orphanage lady was kind to them, even though these kids did nothing but judge them and spit in their faces. I have never rooted for those characters before.Other than that my wife and I only had fun at making fun of this movie. Super predictable, uninspired, and mind blowing character choices. You know when those horror movie moments where you think ""why would you do that?"". This movie is NOTHING BUT THOSE MOMENTS. It almost feels like a parody at times. The last 30 to 40 minutes will blow your mind with how many stupid things happen. The moment that made us laugh the hardest was (SPOILER) the woman who survived the original comes back as an older woman to kill leather face, has him dead to rights with a shotgun and doesn't kill him, locks the main girls in the back of her car, gets a chainsaw through her stomach, is then raised up above leatherface's head and he turns the chainsaw on full blast being showered with her blood. A couple minutes later this same woman shoots him with her shotgun, talks to the main girl, reloads the gun with two more rounds and gives it to her. Watch it with the idea that it's a parody of a TCM movie and it's a lot better.As a horror movie 2/10
As a comedy 10/10 across the board haha.",2022-02-19
"David Blue Garcia's 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' had to go through a massacre of a production process to get to where it is today, and the very fact that it is here today is something of a miracle. On the one hand, it doesn't take full advantage of its glaring opportunity to resolve issues surrounding previous TCM films, but on the other it effectively updates the story for modern audiences whilst not ignoring its origins (for better or for worse).The big difference for me, between previous TCMs and this version, is that the gory set pieces are not only well done but they also feel well earned; there
is enough interest in the characters that when Fede Alvarez wants to do splashy gore, it doesn't feel like a step back, more like a needed release from the tension of the build up.I feel it is perfectly fine and it'll likely work for more people than previous entries have. It's under 1hr 30, it gets on with the job and it delivers efficiently enough, enough times. The film certainly has some genuine scares in it, but the scariest thing about 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', by far, is that it's actually quite good.",2022-02-18

"I really only have one word to sum up my feelings on this film, meh. None of the characters made me care. I guess the gore was good. That's about the best I can say. Feeling about as disappointed as I did after watching Halloween Kills, this movie is certainly chainsawed from the same cloth. If you want a series refresh that won't leave you flat I recommend Spiral.",2022-02-19
"This movie is disturbing and done well, except the last 1 hour of the movie is stupid. The characters make weird choices and there's no way Leatherface can still be alive after drowning and getting several times. I guess it's become one of those similar Myers and Jason movies. But still the gore is obviously well made and allround the movie is disturbing.",2022-02-19
"Loved Leatherface, his aged appearance was fantastic and I think the scene of him emerging from the sunflower field was genuinely beautiful, loved watching that big ugly mug come into scene. That was about the last part I liked, I thought the plot premise was silly and the progression through it was sloppy.Not one of the characters had enough meat or personality to them to be likeable, if you came to this movie for Bubba is was a 10/10, watching him clear out a bus of influencers (despite threats of being ""canceled"") was welcomed to avoid any other poorly written dialogue from the extras.Overall a fun slasher with a couple nice shots that was dragged down by poorly written characters, also why did they try so hard to make Sally Hardesty cool like Laurie Strode it ain't happening.",2022-02-20
"What a terrible movie. I was really anticipating this release and have been counting down for months. But what a letdown. Thank god it was so short. Stick to the trailer.

"I never expected a masterpiece in terms of narrative or writing, but this movie didn't care at all. The number of annoyances in this movie hurt my rational brain.Now shutting my brain off, I appreciate the gore and the good kills throughout the movie. I gave the film four points and they come from two scenes. The first scene is when Leatherface snaps the officer's arm like a twig. The second scene has to be the bus massacre. This bus scene was bloody, gory, and had that classic chainsaw massacre spirit.After the credits rolled out, I had an odd feeling about it. I felt like I had wasted my time with that ending.",2022-02-21
"It's a movie about a big man with a chainsaw killing smaller people without chainsaws. No surprises there. It won't be a life-changing movie for you (I hope). Nor the plot delivers mind shattering twists. Some behaviours are as illogical or straight up dumb as you'd expect. Same for people withstanding wounds that would kill a person 10 times over.BUT what the movie does - it does very well. The visuals, estetique and overall presentation are highlights of this one. The colours and camera action are spot on.The characters are what they are supposed o be. The acting is quite decent and sells whatever the makers want us to feel towards them.Kick back, chill out and watch the pretty massacre.",2022-02-24

Definitely not as good as any of the past versions but not terrible. Storyline is good. Kills are really good. Acting is bad. Worth a watch if you are bored and have nothing else to do.,2022-02-23

"Let's start out with the characters
there were some really badass characters. They didn't even get a long fight scene and one of the chatacters, sally, who waited to get revenge of leather face for killing her friends 50 years ago, died and didnt get revenge
the main characters lila and melody were sisters. They both supposedly finsihed leather face off in the end. However, that's not the case. While they were literally going in their tesla on autopilot, leather face grabs melody, and decapitated her with a chainsaw.The movie ended there
leather face was shot 3 times. His chainsaw got shot, and still worked. Leather face is supposed to be 70+ years old. This movie wasn't even correct like what leather face should have died and it was not a satisfying movie at all. Yes it was entertaining and maybe scared me at least one time in the movie. Time flies while watching it but if u don't wanna get angry find another movie. I have been complaining about it for over 30 minutes now with my cousin. Yeah the gore was good and scary but what.",2022-02-26

There are definitely some solid ideas and concepts throughout the film which save it from being an unwatchable mess but they just weren't executed properly and it really is a shame. Wish is wasn't so hard for this franchise to get a good film.,2022-02-28
"When the opening scene happened I was very excited and had high expectations. Seeing how leatherface can snap a mans arm in two with one hand and proceed to slit their throat with their exposed wrist bone had me thrilled. From there my it just went all down hill along with my expectations and was not even scary one bit. Even when he cuts off the victims facial skin to wear as a mask. Soon after a few killings leatherface busts his chain saw out of the wall of the orphanage he's been living in since 1975 and it miraculously fires up after a few pulls even though it's been buried for 50 years. Then he kills everyone the same way over, and over and over again... Imagine a 90yr old leather face walking around killing everyone.. that's how slow and redundant his killings are.. The last 15 mins had more action and you on the edge of your seat like you'd expect from a classic Texas chain saw massacre movie during the whole thing NOT just the ending part. Don't waste your time with this one.",2022-03-02
"The main characters are absolutely atrocious to say the least. It seems a stupid attempt to incorporate diversity and politics into a movie. The movie is obviously trying way to hard to check all the boxes and it's apparent. The best parallel I can draw is to the first episode of Brooklyn nine nine season 8. Where they tried to hit all the buzz words surrounding BLM.I think it's important to incorporate diversity but not in a forced way. The entire vibe of the characters is off, they feel plastic and fake, no real audience to character connection.The positives are few and far between. The cinematography is amazing, beautiful colour grade and shot. Sound design is also amazing.But please for the love of god, when the next one comes out in another 5 years. Have a good cast that isn't plastic. That's all I ask.",2022-03-05

I've watched all of the Texas chainsaw movies over the years. This version is definitely the worst!The script of the movie is all over the place with no clear consensus. The acting was grade C if that and overall not the horror standards we would expect in this day and age.,2022-03-19
The film itself is fine but there were very few moments where it actually felt like it belonged in the Texas Chainsaw franchise. Hopefully they can fix this with another one.,2022-03-20
The ONLY thing that could have made this worse to me would have been to have had ROB ZOMBIE do it!...this move was so NOT NEEDED! Too much gore and not nearly enough story to support it.

"To begin with the story was straight forward, 3 friends go to a town that has been abondoned for years. In this abondoned town they go to a house and they find themselves in an unexpected situation. These friends thought there was no one in the house and the town but they find a mother and her son inside the house. The mother is old and her son is also in his 40s too. These friends are not happy with them being inside the house and they call the police. Police then takes the old women away From the town, her son goes with the old women while she is been taken away. While they're on their journey after few minutes the old women died, Leather face is the name given to the pshcho. Leather face wants to take revenge and kills everyone who is on the van with him. There were 2 police officers and 1 of the friends that went to the old town. Both officers were male and the 3rd victim of leather face in the van was female. He had no mercy on any of these victims. These scenes were full of suspense and terror because the 3rd victim was still alive until he was caught in the van alive. Leather face is wearing the mask that is made of human skin. The leather face is now going back to the town to get revenge from others too. Leather face is very strong and he also finds his chainsaw that was hidden inside the wall. One the deadliest scene is when the leather face is in the bus and everyone in the bus he got their phones out and their all live showing leather face on the screen. Not many survived the attack because there was not many places to escape. The best things about the movie is that there was no waste of time, the movie was nice and short with very good running time. The acting was good, the roles were played Good too.",2022-04-02

"This movie had potential... I am so disappointed with this franchise! It could of been so much better. Instead..... It made no sense. How did you take an awesome classic and turn it into this? Wasn't scary to say the least... Barely any plot structure... It was just a total mess. What happened to the girl in the school shooting? Like why have those flash backs but not share a little insight on what happened. I mean yea... A school shooting but why put that in there when it has nothing to do with the plot... Movie could of been so much better... It was just another waste. I couldn't wait to watch it and once again, a flop. It has no suspense at all. More could of been done. This was a waste of money at this point.",2022-09-04
"Other than the original, I pretty comfortably find that this film is the best in the franchise. After wading through bad sequel after bad prequel after bad reboot after bad remake after bad prequel to the remake (this franchise sucks aside from the original classic) this film actually had me invested most of the time. The film follows the footsteps of Halloween (2018), having the old killer coming out of retirement with the younger generation becoming the focus of his wrath and being confronted by the survivor of the original film in order to put the monster down for good, only Texas Chainsaw Massacre executes the idea better.It may just be because I had just watched horrendous films such as Leatherface (2017) and that trash Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre that I think this one is good? But I found the lead characters, while flawed and some kinda a******s, weren't unbearable. They actually sort of came off as real people to me? At least reasonably so, considering that these are characters in a horror film. I actually didn't want them to die, so some of the scenes actually provided a certain level of tension, I found. Something largely absent from most other entries in the series.The film doesn't do anything spectacular with the gore, but it serves up the dish as ordered for sure. Very solid effects work here. Some CGI, yeah, but after watching Texas Chainsaw 3D, WOOOOOOO BOY the effects here are SO much better. Practical was fairly well done and the CGI were about as well done as I can hope for. There are no CRAZY kill scenes here, but there several moments that got me. It was quite serviceable in the gore dept. I'll also mention here that this one doesn't rely on jumps scares to get at you, not like some OTHER TCM films I could name.The acting was nothing special, nothing bad. Pretty much every actor ranged from not all that great to decent. Serviceable, yes. Writing, not half-bad. Directing; competent. Music did it's job, albeit forgettable. The film draws enough from all of it's elements to just squeak out a pretty well-done, decent film. And at only 83 minutes, the film in no way overstays its welcome. Good enough for a watch I'd say. And if I ever watch the original and want to follow it up with more, this film or TCM3 will be the ones I'll be watching.",2023-10-22
"This could have been amazing..Not sure where to start..So, apparently leatherface is 26 in the original, and this is set 47 years later.. Which would now make him 73.There is absolutely no way he's a 73 year old man in this.He does more running about than a prize greyhound.There is zero connection with any of the characters, even the one remaining survivor from the original.She had waited 47 years... To be killed off in 2 minutes.The other victims went out their way to make every bad decision they possibly could have, which is typical in horror.. But this was just embarrassing.When it comes to leatherface,any depth they could have added to the character was either so unbelievably thin.. Or they didn't add anything to him at all.He's been living in some old woman's house. A house upon which she flies a racist flag. And that's all that's said about it.What was that all about?I could go on about loads but I've just wasted an hour and half watching this and now I'm tired.The ending.Well.. You knew what was coming for ages, kind of.One of the victims picks up his chainsaw.. And instead of gutting him or cutting his feet off or some other general stabbing... She uppercuts him with it.. And he falls into water.Next thing you know.. They're all happy, they've jumped in a self driving car.. Leaving the town.. When leatherface smashes the window in and drags one of the girls out.. All while the other girl hangs out the sun roof reaching out screaming while driving away at about 2mph.",2022-02-19

"I approached this movie with anticipation and dread. Those of us old enough to have seen the original TCM 1974 version know that it's the gold standard that everything else after is measured against.What I did like: the cinematography, editing, special effects and the erieness of the abandoned town of Harlow. The shot where Leatherface pokes his head up through the dead sunflower field gave me chills.Most of the characters I couldn't care less about, except for Sally, and the gruff mechanic who tries to help the sisters, and the sisters near the end. The bus scene was funny and gross. Lots of underlying commentary about materialism and social media.I got tired of the same old is he dead/not dead scares that have been used so many times before. The plot had big enough holes to drive a truck through. The end was not a good one for me. Don't expect too much out of this and you'll be fine.",2022-02-21

"Good gore, good suspense. Paused to go to the bathroom and noticed how little of the movie there was left. Like wow has it been more than half already? Not my type of movie but I'm so happy they went with the old horror cliche that when all seems over and safe, it's not, disliked that character and just waited, hoping for it to be killed and it was satisfying.",2022-02-22
"The premise of this sequel is that over the last 50 years, Leatherface has been holding up in the defunct orphanage of a ghost town in rural Texas. The only other remaining residents are an enfeebled old woman who ran the orphanage and a contractor/mechanic (?) in his 30s who either lives in or works out of a garage in this town. That is, until our band of main characters, two of whom are social media influencers, decide to adopt the town as their own and entice others to revive the township.The biggest downfall out of the gate is the infection of woke politics that provide certain characters with inane motives just to get the plot moving, though I have to say they're not actually all that unrealistic given the state of modern leftists. Credit where it is due; while the young mechanic character is first portrayed as a stereotypical gun-toting redneck, the writers managed to make him somewhat two dimensional as the film goes on.By about the halfway point, the entire plot devolves into a series of events that just don't make any sense with characters more or less waiting around to be murdered in gruesome fashion. Even closer to the end, there are definitely some directorial issues as there are shots missing in some sequences and the most glaring problem of all being characters living far longer than their injuries would permit.All in all, this sequel had a reasonably good premise; I like the idea of people trying to revive a ghost town that Leatherface is hiding out in and that they gave him a reasonable motivation for going homicidal on the people invading his town. The set design was quite good, though not especially (there's some comically bare drawers in a scene of someone rooting around the orphanage), the cinematography was serviceable, but at least showed the passage of time effectively, and the make-up effects were adequate (though many of them were digital). The performances were terrible and flat and the script had nothing original beyond the premise. Could be a good watch for a laugh, but I stopped having fun by the thirty to forty minute mark.",2022-04-23
"I had no idea this was being released so I went in with a very open mind. The biggest credit to this film is the cinematography. There are some beautifully haunting shots. My biggest problem, are the characters themselves. Not only are they incredibly unlikeable, naive, but just plain dumb. Many decisions made by the characters will leave you wondering if they should even be surprised of the outcome.Horror audiences are smarter and so it makes it even scarier when you find yourself identifying with a characters actions. Instead, they are portrayed as cliche, teenage idiots who are cannon fodder for the slaughter. I will say, the initial reaction to characters seeing leather face is spot on social commentary. As with many things, it's done too often to be as effective as intended. It has promise but definitely has it's flaws.",2022-02-19
"I made an IMDB account just so I could leave a 1 star review. I grew up watching the texas chainsaw massacre movies, it being one of my favorite movie franchises. I had a feeling based off of ""leather face"" this one was going to be bad... but actually, it was so much worse! I turned this atrocity off after about 45 minutes in. Everything from the actors, the town, the kills... and what's up with his face??? This was such a shame. Honestly everyone involved in this movie should do their best to rid it of the internet or simply just pretend they never were a part of it. I know I'll be pretending it's not a part of an amazing movie franchise. This is really a shame and an insult to the rest of the films and the creators.",2022-02-18

From being Tesla driving hipsters complaining about emissions, and gun toting Americans, to the African American character complaining about the ""Dixie flag"". Oh and don't forget about ""survivor"" of the school shooting.

"At it's heart, this film is about liberal, ""idealistic"" youth and a fear of gentrification basically.A group of friends have bought up a run-down town where they plan to sell off property to probably artisan bakeries and hipster clothing stores. After going into an orphanage to take down a confederate flag fearing it will put off the buyers, the group run into an old woman who claims she still owns the building. After getting into a heated argument (in which the old woman makes a racist remark), police arrive and she suffers what appears to be a heart attack.We learn that this women has apparently taken in Leatherface, and is acting as a mother figure. In doing so has left Leatherface hanging up his chainsaw. On a very weird ride to the hospital, where Leatherface is sitting in the back of an ambulance, his ""mother"" dies, and so the killing spree begins.As the film goes on, the two sisters (Melody and Lila) begin to question if it's their fault the murderous rampage has begun (it is very much h suggested it is).Sally returns to help fight off Leatherface, though only briefly before she is snuffed out and thrown into a pile of rubbish.In the end, the Final Girl gets away, and Leatherface goes back to his home.Pretty typical film, it follows on reasonably well from the original and has enough gore, though it is severely lacking in any sort of substance. The director seems intent of drilling home the idea that youth culture is ruining society, and doesn't seem to have much storytelling ability.It's an okay film if you want to switch off for an hour or so, but don't go in expecting miracles.",2022-09-14

It's okay as a stand alone horror movie but when you enter in the fact that it's a part of the tcm franchise its not good. The 2003 remake was better than this one and I still don't like it either. Also the ending was disappointing and the whole of it was poorly written.,2022-03-05

"I thought it was okay but I don´t like what there doing with Leatherface in this one they just make him out to be some killing machine when in the original he was far more than that. He was abused by his family and was told to do those killings, why are they trying to make him the next Jason Voorhees?? Why not just stick with what the original did, or better yet why are they still making Texas Chainsaw movies when all they do is suck.",2022-03-03
"This may have been the worst movie I have ever seen. I always assumed Leatherface was supposed to be human. Apparently, I was wrong. I just watched a man get hit 6 or more times at close range with a shotgun and be completely unaffected. All of this after yuppies attempt to buy ghost town in the middle of nowhere to try to change it into a commercial hub. Please save yourself 83 minutes and don't waste your time.",2022-03-19
