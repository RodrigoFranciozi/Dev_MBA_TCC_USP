"Pain Hustlers is an opioid rendition of the Wolf of Wall Street by the way of The Big Short which means it's a really entertaining true story with a clear purpose but it's also really hard to deny that it took the safest and most boring approach to telling such an important story, drowning out the more serious aspects in favour of something more generic.Emily Blunt is great, the film wants you to genuinely care about her despite the flaws and it's her skill that actually makes that happen. Chris Evans continues to get as far away from Captain America as humanly possible with another undemanding yet enjoyable irredeemable asshole.It's so nice to see director David Yates finally break free of the Harry Potter franchise with something so different, even if the newfound style here is derivative and remains fairly desaturated. The needle drops are used the right amount, they work well even if some of them are incredibly obvious song choices.",2023-10-27
"First off, it's not like the pain killer shows from Netflix and Hulu, different drug. Secondly, I don't understand why people are hating on the movie. Story line is great, acting is great and it's an interesting story based on true events. Not sure what else you really need in a film to make it at a bare minimum enjoyable.Saw a review said ""it's not cool for a kid to start a forest fire."" As that statement is true, the movie didn't make it cool n it's literally 7seconds of the film. Or someone else was comparing it to a Scorsese film? Lol I guess having music and interesting story makes that true? People are so sensitive and just can't enjoy a movie.",2023-10-27
"Like some other posters I am at a loss to discern why this got poor reviews. It's well made, has a great cast and is a pertinent moral tale. Blunt is the star of course and she carries the film along with Chris Evans. Based on a true story it exposes the corruption in the pharmaceutical industry that fosters greed and profit over the actual health of America's citizens. Once Blunt's character, her fellow sales people and all the immoral doctors involved in prescribing pain meds get hooked on huge payouts, no one cares about the damaged lives that resulted. It's very entertaining and very sobering and justice prevails.",2023-10-29
"I saw this movie as a parody through the language, the visuals, the clothes. Everything. It was a parody about what happened to a company that had a great thing, but!!! As always. Someone wanted more. MUCH more. So they figured out a way to crack the system, and flush a really good thing for one group, down the proverbial toilet. Only this time, some top people actually went to prison for their illegal and immoral actions.What a concept!The fact is that these people were odd. LIza was a stripper who had no degrees - and, yes, a heart of gold. She had the street smarts that were needed and Dr. Neel saw that and he was smart enough to take advantage of it rather than sticking to the bs of ""Must have a degree"". Give me street smarts any day.It's an interesting, fast flick with a great group of actors who never slow down to let you keep up. That's up to you.So, get that bowl of movie salad ready - and enjoy the ride!",2023-10-27
"I found the movie to be very watchable & more realistic than given credit for in other reviews. It's easy to dislike a character whose behavior is unprincipled & likely to harm others, as in the case of all the main players in this film. But in doing so, you ignore the fact that people are complex, usually not all good or all bad. Circumstances can dictate behavior & should be taken into account. Liza Drake wasn't a bad person. She was a smart, desperate person looking for a way out of her dead end job & seized an opportunity that looked promising initially. Pete was more comfortable behaving unscrupulously. I think both Emily Blunt & Chris Evans brought their characters to life in a realistic way. I also feel like Liza Drake was a good mother. The reviewer who was offended by Liza's response to her daughter's fire starting was a minor incident in the story. I found the movie to be quite interesting, as well as a decent portrayal of the pharmaceutical industry. You can't ignore the headlines of the last several years.",2023-10-27
"Performances of the main leads (Emily Blunt and Chris Evans) were good , their chemistry was okay. Story line was also okay. Though I do get why some people would give this movie a bad ratings. However in my own opinion, I found the movie to be interesting since it was base on real life story and a good reflection on people's never-ending desires for success.If you ask me if it's worthy to watch or not, I'd say it is. We all have various standards about what a good movie should be like, therefore I'd suggest ""give it a try"". If you've read terrible reviews don't mind it ,that doesn't accurately reflect the entire movie.",2023-10-27
"I have watched the docs on the Sackler Family and their horrendous responsibility of hiring young women to pimp out drugs to doctors and clinics causing the deaths of millions. Still in court I believe with a huge settlement on the horizon.Emily Blunt and Catherine O'Hara are a feast of good acting and the supporting cast are excellent.I am familiar with the story line but here it is told from the point of view of one salesperson (they were all attractive, sexy drug pushers) hauled into the marketing by force of her poverty and inability to make ends meet.The story unwinds well and a story of rags to riches to rags is always entertaining.8/10.",2023-10-30
"I was busting my brain to try and remember where have I seen the same pharmaceutical sales and bribes and couldn't remember. So, WOWS (""Wolf of Wall Street"") it is, from the point of comparison, but it still meets with the other movie I can't seem find in my private memory lane.Emily Blunt's character and beginning of story are more or less the same, almost until the final act of the plot, but rather different in some ways. Blunt's Liza Drake is motivated to break her poverty cycle and wants to give better life to her daughter so she hustles with a pain killer, which she believes can do good for the pain of people with cancer.The directing of David Yates (who got his fame from directing half of ""Harry Potter"" films and then plunged down with directing all of ""Fantastic Beasts"" trilogy) is no different or special then other movies which are based on a true, ecstatic-rise from the gutters story. He is telling a story and the narrative is of his protagonist, which is also an antagonist for some of the time.The cast is phenomenal and Blunt leads in a spectacular way. Its fun watching Evens become a swearing dick and not the polished and shiny Captain America. Andy Garcia is stoic and good and it was nice to meet, once again, Catherine O'Hara (which her face is so recognized with 90's movies, such as: ""Beetlejuice"" and Kevin's mom from ""Home Alone"").The grade until now is not flattering and the fact it is a Netflix production, which includes two mega stars - all are pointing it is going to be a flop and a failure, but the fact I was not interested to know the time or how much time is left sets this one as a successful big N production.",2023-10-28
"In style & content, inspired-by-truth pharma-scandal drama ""Pain Hustlers"" feels like it's been made many times before. Struggling single-mum Emily Blunt (daughter of Catherine O'Hara) takes a low-level sales job in Chris Evans, Andy Garcia, Amit Shah & Jay Duplass' small pain-drug company, which she saves from closure, then turns into a massive overnight success via dubious, immoral & ultimately illegal methods of 'recruiting' doctors to write scripts & bump up prescriptions. It's polished (by fine blockbuster director David Yates) but the Wells Tower screenplay and Blunt & Evans performances are tired. Big Pharma sucks - ok Hollywood, we got the memo, enough.",2023-10-30
This Move is a solid 8 if not a 9.The acting is solid.The story is solid.I was thoroughly entertained throughout the movie.Emily Blunt is adorable as The Rookie drug rep.Chris Evans plays a blinder as the dodgy Drug Executive.The fact that this is a true story is really frightening.It's even more frightening when you realise that Fentanyl is still available and widely used as is oxycontin.I never cease to be amazed at the tolerance The World has for The pharmaceutical Industry.This move shows just how little regard they have for the rest of us.I would highly recommend this Movie for all all and I've no idea why there is much hate being thrown at it .Maybe the hate is being sponsored by someone??????,2023-10-28
"I don't know what others are talking about. I found this movie very entertaining and informative. We've known for years that big Pharma caters to, brides and pay doctors in accepting their drugs and writing prescriptions for them.Believe me, I've seen plenty of drug companies rent out an entire theatre and give doctors all kinds of perks. Trips, money and incredible expensive items.In addition, character played by Emily Blunt is spot on in appearance and demeanor. Drug reps strut like peacocks into these doctor offices to tout their goods. I've even heard them joking and flirting when in the next room
It's all a game and the patients are the guinea pigs. I wouldn't trust the FDA as far as I could throw them.",2023-10-28
"Carried by a typically strong Blunt performance, Pain Hustlers is both watchable and eye-opening, even though its dramatic impulses do kind of cancel each other out.Directed by David Yates, who has spent most of the last two decades helming ""Harry Potter"" movies and prequels and might not be the best fit for this material, Pain Hustlers aims to be a fast-paced, raucous, blunt and slick work a la ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and ""The Big Short,"" but winds up caught between the worlds of breezy satire and hard truth. Emily Blunt and Chris Evans are fabulous but you'll be hard-pressed to remember anything else by the time the credits are done rolling.But the movie does succeed in unpacking the raw grift and exploitation of the pharma sales business, and the wider dysfunction of the American health care and legal systems that allows it to go unchecked. So a thumbs up on that part.My Rating: 6.5/10.",2023-10-29
"The Zanna pharmaceutical company has rigorous standards in hiring practices of their sales forces. Ph. D.s are required. However, the company's definition of a Ph. D. is as follows: poor, hungry, and dumb.There was an over-the-top approach to satirizing a serious topic, namely, the greed of big pharma that led to senseless deaths due to fentanyl addiction and overdose. Every segment of the food chain was the subject of satire in this film, including the pharma executives and their sales staff; the greedy doctors; and the pitiful, gullible, and sheep-like patients.Emily Blunt was good in the leading role of Liza Drake, the stripper who may have been poor and hungry, but she was not dumb. She dynamically used her natural gifts in sales to hoodwink doctors into promoting the miracle pain reliever Lonafen.The minor character of Stephanie may have been central to the tragic side of Liza Drake's life. Stephanie was a fellow resident at a fleabag and noisy motel when Liza's life had reached a low point. Stephanie gave Liza the gift of a comforter and some ear plugs. She later sat in court and watched Liza's sentencing to fifteen months in prison. Stephanie was leading a modest, happy life in the motel and was the modeling basic human values of decency that were missing in Liza's life.The motto of the slick Zanna group was ""Own the doctor and own your destiny."" Stephanie's life was a demonstration of how dispiriting and evil the lives of the pain hustlers could be.",2023-10-28
"It's a nine, instead of a 10 out of 10. This movie doesn't spend every moment on high glamour shots, though it could have with this tale. It doesn't need to for this genre, as the story itself is a sensationalization of a blockbuster true story. Th there a lot of stories coming out about the big players in the opiate epidemic. I think this one is important because it shows more than just the executive and accounting and lifestyle side. We actually get very little lifestyle outside of the company actions, which I appreciate. Also, it shows ways that legal fentanyl managed to penetrate the market for off-label pain management prescriptions. The acting is well done, the casting fits, and it's well told. I like this style of narratives based on a true story. ""I, Tonya"" did this too, where they have little cut ins of the people who consulted on the movie, which are also characters in the story of course. Allows them to give you little tastes of what the people are like, but also highlights that this is a fictional
Account of a real thing, as told by public sources and the people in the story telling the story they want told. It's clever and it's entertainingWell made movie about an interesting and important subject. Doesn't feel like a documentary, but in a good way. And I love documentaries.It also illuminates something that happens in most corporations' decisions, but which can be a dangerous mindset in the dark. Which is that a demand by stockholders for growth in a company, rather than strong corporate governance practices and market share resilience, can drive executives (who tend to get a large portion of their pay in shares) to drive the demand into adjacent markets. In the health sector, this would be patient groups.Combine this with a strategy that does make sense for most companies, but here became the framework the pill mills could be built on: targeting the smaller doctor practitioners who weren't being courted by the Big pharma reps. Less expensive marketing, which is good because it allows small and midsize companies to compete in the market at all, but doctors whose patient volume and share of advanced cancer patients is going to be smaller because they have less patients in general, and because the larger doctors and hospital groups will be doing other care for many of these types of patients and often handle the pain management as well. I'm sure you can see how this could easily lead to patients finishing up cancer care or specialist care or experiencing side effects from cancer treatments they want to have documented but wouldn't need an oncologist appt for, hitting up their local Dr to see what can be done. This doctor will see them after the cause of the pain subsides. How can it even be determined properly that, when taking a pain medicine-which doesn't target specific pain-you can tell when the pain subsides to not need it? After all, taking this stuff chronically leads to feeling pain from withdrawal when you don't have it. Which feels just like, well, pain. It's a difficult situation. But greed at the small level scales too.",2023-10-30
"I was perplexed as to why the rating was so low for this film... Until I scrolled down. The first bad review was in reference to an incident at the beginning of the film. The daughter accidentally created a minor forest fire, and instead of her mother being riddled with guilt, she opposed her daughters expulsion. Outside of said meeting, she expressed her disapproval for her daughters actions. However, said reviewer somehow perceived this minor scene to be some sort of promotional piece for arson, and somehow it equates to the movie being of poor quality. Society is so irrational nowadays. I do not know if the poor reviews gain any further credibility, as this was enough clarity. If you are sane, watch this movie, and potentially enjoy it. I'm not saying that this movie is beloved by everybody. But critique it rationally.",2023-10-28
"This movie was very entertaining, really well acted, great plot -- the negative ratings are over inane points that probably would not bother the vast majority of viewer I feel. And though obviously these ""based on a true story"" films are bound to include exaggerations of reality, I thought the way that the story managed to illustrate how things can go from being ""David vs Goliath"" to flipping the script (pun intended) and becoming predatory was really well done.Overall 8/10: Highly Recommended -- if you're not someone who likes to heavily dissect things, I don't think it is possible to regret this one!",2023-10-28
"Emily Blunt is good in everything (and *great* in some of them), but she's said in the past that she tries to avoid mimicking an American accent, as she does here. And I can see (hear) why: Kate Winslet is mistress extraordinaire of American accents, whereas Emily struggles from scene to scene to sound like she's from the same, distinct place. Because a lot of British actors have heard and studied Southern drawls (think Vivien Leigh) they tend to lapse into one whether meaning to or not. Anyway, Emily gives a good, believable performance as the lead in this big Pharma tale, but Chris Evans struggles against his ingrained ""nice guy"" image, Catherine O'Hara goes over the top as the mother of Emily's character, and Andy Garcia-I don't even know what to say. In the last year or so, there have been several mini-series about the infamous case of OxyContin & Purdue Pharma, and they were better than this film about a lesser-known Fentanyl nasal spray. Check those out instead of this one, unless like me, you must see EVERYthing Emily Blunt's in!",2023-10-28
"This movie is polarising, no question about it. The subject is controversial. Fentanyl. Big pharma. Doctors and scripts.I started to watch it and at first I thought it was a documentary. It's not.I nearly pulled out at the beginning. However, the storyline of this young woman who wanted to survive by becoming a sales rep got my attention.Her struggles, her meteoric rise to fortune from her down on her luck situation.Casting is very good, quite believable characters although it's perhaps a caricature of the industry and the opioid crisis ? That I don't know.One thing is certain: the movie left me disturbed and a little agitated. Hence, not a good idea to watch this movie before going to bed.",2023-10-29
"""Pain Hustlers"" is a story revolving around a pharmceutical company.First off,many people are giving a very low review for this film that it just copies ""Wolf of Wall Street"" etc. This movie was not released to break any collection records (or) win some academy awards. This movie is a ""Saturdat Movie Night"" one-time-watch movie. If the viewers treat it just like that and enter without any kind of expectations many people will have a good time-pass.The acting of the main cast Chris Evans and Emily Blunt was on-point. They both did justice to their characters .Being the ""bad guy"" is kind of suiting Chris Evans from ""The Gray Man"" itself.One point I would like to highlight is that atleast one character i.e. Liza Drake's character arc of redemption could have been executed a bit better by linking her daughter's epilepsy to the patients who died of drug overdose. Then,many people would have connected in a more deeper sense.This movie is not about anything on a grand scale (or) some kind of once-in-a-generation film (or) something. It is shot for a one-time-watch with a likeable cast and a normal plot,so do the same :)",2023-10-28
"I thought this movie was pretty good. The storyline is not new (follows desperate sales people doing questionable things in the name of the almighty dollar), but it is loosely based on a true story. Blunt, Evans and O'Hara were great in their roles. Garcia was low key and I felt he was a back seat player even though his character was integral (because he owned the company). He was just weird😀, who knows maybe the real guy was too. I think the story did a good job of telling how desperate people walk right into hinky doings in the pursuit of money, only to later have misgivings and try to backtrack. I was happy to have seen it.",2023-10-29
"How did they manage to turn such a basically wild story of greed and lies into a dud of a movie?The bad: I blame the direction firstmost for lack of true drama and thrill. This story just toddles along while it is in essence full of lies and deceit, ingredients with which a director for sure COULD HAVE come up with a more exciting movie...More bad: the actors are miscast. Emily Blunt especially is always cast for roles of sweethearts or good girls, but now she has to perform a lowlife greedy b*0c! And she just isnt very believable. What's much worse though is the opposing leading male actor, whom I have never heard of before and whom I hope never to see again, because he was BLAND incorporated. Complete nobody.Such a story of greed and deceit deserves a better direction and cast, but unfortunately this turned out to be just a lame duck without any real thrill.",2023-10-28
"This movie was ok, but there are already two other that have been made that are a lot better, and one is way better than this one. Evidently there are going to be as many movies made about the opioid/fentanyl crisis as were made about Nazis. And slashers.So, my gripe is not so much with the quality of the acting, storyline, or directing, or production value. It is about that I already have that T-shirt. It is definitely the same ole same ole, samey-same.Others complained about the other show on Netflix about the opioid crisis being a cheap rip-off of Dopesick. This one is a cheaper rip off of both of those.Dopesick is the absolute class of this genera.",2023-10-29
"This movie would normally be a 6 to 7 stars movie for me but in order to counterbalance all the ridiculous 1-3 stars, I had to put a 10. Pain Hustlers has a good story to tell with great actors but is flawed in its execution. First half is better than second half and overall it felt a bit long. The interviews portion did not work for me and felt phony. I thought the cast did great though. This is Liza's story and Emily Blunt shines in the role. She is also well supported by Chris Evans, Andy Garcia, Catherine O'Hara and Chloe Coleman. Emily and Chris have great chemistry and their scenes together are the best parts of the movie. Wish Chris was given more to do though. He was great in that last scene with Emily. Overall, I still enjoyed the movie.",2023-10-27
"Given the recent a spate of movies and limited series about the opioid crisis, Pain Hustlers risked being a Johnny Come Lately take on one of the US' most pressing issues.But the very human storyline and stellar casting makes for compelling viewing. The series does a great job of addressing a weighty topic without getting heavy-handed.Emily Blunt really carries the show, but Chris Evans really excels in his return to the role of likeable jerk.Andy Garcia and Catherine O'Hara really round out the ensemble. O'Hara is an especially inspired bit of casting and, in typical form, is an absolute scene stealer.",2023-10-27
"I watch everything that includes Emily Blunt. This one was disappointing. The story of Opiod addiction as a result of lies told to doctors about the merits of their drug has already been told several times. Virtually all previous films about this topic were much better. Blunt was, as expected, excellent in her role but the other characters which included Chris Pine, Andy Garcia and Catherine O'Hara were more like caricatures than real people. Most of the film was spent on Emily Blunt leaving her employment at the promise of greater earnings with a pharmaceutical company in order to take care of her daughter. More than half of the film dealt with Blunt's development and ability to encourage the sales staff to be successful in selling their drug to doctors to prescribe to cancer patients. Much less time was devoted to her becoming disillusioned and feeling disappointed with her role in the distribution of an addictive and lethal drug. The film overall was not satisfying and only a diehard fan of Emily Blunt, as I am, would find justification for watching.",2023-10-28
"I will start out with a warning: this movie will win you over or completely lose you in the first seven minutes. There are multiple character beats that you might find to be really funny, or you might find to be completely repugnant. If you find them repugnant, then just stop watching. Nothing that follows in the movie is going to bring you back. For me, I found them funny and greatly enjoyed the experience.The movie is a typical rise-fall story, a core storytelling structure that is literally as old as the Bible. (Take THAT, guy who said it's a Wolf of Wall Street rip-off.) It is inspired by a true story arising from the pharmaceutical side of the opioid crisis. As with any movie based on real events, modifications are made as necessary to fit it into three acts that take less than two hours. It's a movie that, like most movies, does not try to be real-world accurate. The real people aren't that good looking, they aren't as articulate or funny, the real locations aren't that large or colourful, and the pieces of the real puzzle don't click together so neatly. It's a movie. It tells a story that is worthy of being told while aiming for emotional accuracy if not... well... being entirely true.I found the performances to be very strong. Catherine O'Hara in particular was over-the-top in exactly the right measure. (Those not familiar with her body of work might be surprised to hear that this performance is pretty restrained compared to everything else she has done, most recently the TV series Schitt's Creek.) Emily Blunt was terrific, and Chris Evans was cast perfectly as the guy who made Blunt's rise possible, and was largely responsible for her fall. Overall, there wasn't a single bad note from any of the performances.It isn't a movie that rises above the genre in the way that some of, say, Quentin Tarantino's movies do. But - if you are okay with the darkness of the humour - it's an enjoyable movie to watch, and one that can justify a second viewing.",2023-10-28
"Wow this was REALLY bad.Pain Hustlers is a movie that has a great cast and an interesting concept but unfortunately the sloppy narrative, extremely obxnious characters and messy direction fails to make this movie interesting. Director David Yates clearly has talent with his directing works on the Harry Potter franchise but Yates direction felt sloppy and all over the place. The narrative feels like it tries to be something from Martin Scorsese or Oliver Stone type but it falls apart quickly because the narrative felt unsocial, the tone is all over the place, and the characters are extremely unlikable to the point and boring. The dialogue felt forced, the production is cheap and there are attempts of humor but each attempt falls apart pretty quickly.The performances honestly are good. Chris Evans and Emily Blunt are doing their best but their performance isn't able to save the movie at all. This could have been a fun movie but it ends up being really bad and annoying to sit through. Overall, it's painful.",2023-10-27
"Not before time a drama-docu-drama showing how the road to hell is paved with good intentions..!It started off with a 'cheap' feel to it, assuming they had to show the stark contrast of ..anyone can ""sell"" in America regardless of their background.They soon got into their stride (if you can blank out Emily Blunt's Ameri-can't accent) and rags-to-riches at the expense of personal and legal ethics became self evident.The dangers of prescribing ""off label"" for 'other' conditions aren't only restricted to opioids as shown here. There are many more areas of pseudo medicine based on ""edited studies"" they could/should be making films about..Somewhat ironic that, Emily Blunt's Uncle (a politician) is on the record in favour of ""off label"" use of prescription drugs..for recreational purposes! Who knows maybe he'll watch this film and change his mind?",2023-10-30
"Fascinating beginning of how the story took shape with a woman who had a good knack for sales, making it to the top of the pharma sales team for a new product.Emily Blunt is fabulous as is Chris Evans and their chemistry and work relationship is fun to watch. Andy Garcia is fabulous as the doctor as his Catherine O'Hare as Emily's mom.The plot is fairly predictable and it's amazing how hugely profitable big Pharma could grow in such a short period of time based on how they infiltrates these second rate doctors.The set designs are great, especially the wonderful estates that they are all living in; but even the dive hotels where they started with the speaker tours.Costumes are fabulous! Emily's outfit are great!It was entertaining but sad since we all know how big pharma has f&$ked this world.",2023-10-29
"Main story is a sad truth. Behind peoples agony to aliviate their pain even if it's uncurable some companies take advantage of them.So in the mail plot we have the all time goddess Emily blunt rising from her ashes trying to deal with her problems and Mr America Chris Evans that gives her a chance to involve. The story somehow starts a bit absurd but rolls somehow interesting.The role part is kinda sloppy but does the trick to be a whole sum in general. Andy Garcia plays a mystery role but too short for his leak, however he leaves some of his material in it.Generally the movie is flat but with some points. The cast is steady but you feel they don't cooperate as a total. Nice movie, a bit picturescue, foggy result BUT I love blunt and I like this Chris Evans macho role. It's a 7/10 from me.",2023-10-29
"Pain Hustlers, directed by David Yates, is a thrilling crime drama that takes viewers on a captivating journey through the ambitions and perils of its protagonist, Liza Drake, brilliantly portrayed by Emily Blunt. With a standout performance by the lead actress and the addition of Chris Evans, this film delivers an engaging cinematic experience.At its core, Pain Hustlers explores the struggles and aspirations of Liza Drake (Emily Blunt), a high-school dropout dreaming of a better life for her young daughter. Blunt's portrayal of Liza is mesmerizing, capturing both her charm and determination with a nuanced performance that draws the audience into her world. Blunt's on-screen chemistry with Chris Evans, who plays a pivotal role in the film, adds depth to their characters' dynamic and enhances the overall narrative.Under the direction of David Yates, known for his work on the Harry Potter film series, Pain Hustlers transports viewers to Central Florida's yellowing strip mall, capturing the faded dreams and desperate aspirations of its characters. Yates' skillful direction brings a sense of authenticity to the setting, effectively utilizing it as a metaphor for Liza's journey and the risks she takes to achieve success.",2023-10-28
"We've really started to see a lot of movies of this kind. Yes, I understand the message they want to convey in an entertaining way, but I don't feel it's delivered accurately, so I find the movie somewhat complicated. I should also add that it has a very average plot, and it fails to make it interesting in many aspects.I won't say anything about the acting because, in my opinion, everyone falls short of the level they should play at. There are scenes where everyone seems forced, and it feels like I'm watching myself overact. Chris Evans wasn't bad, but I still don't think we've seen his full potential in this film, even though he does make a difference. Is it at the desired level? Not at all.Yes, there were a few nice scenes, but the shots were repetitive. Especially, the excessive use of slow-motion, when it could be effective once, was puzzling. This is a movie, not an Instagram story.If I move on to spoilers, the way pharmaceutical companies hook doctors like snacks is a clear sign that medicine is not practiced with belief these days. We all make mistakes, but when people come to the medical and healthcare sector in need, it should not be exploited. I understand the character Liza giving a statement and accepting her punishment, but if someone thinks that money will bring them respect, unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. Money blinds, but development earns respect. Give yourself your own respect.",2023-10-28
"A David Yates film that I can't believe opened at the Toronto International Film Festival.It was scripted from the New York Times Magazine article of the same name by Evan Hughes.Sony Pictures assembled an ensemble cast for this film (for some reason).Although the film does a good job of explaining the Opioid epidemic, at the end of the day, since these events are internal affairs of the USA, ninety percent of those who watch this film will focus on the ""pharmaceutical industry"", not the Opioid epidemic.While this is the case, the film Puncture (2011), in which Chris Evans shows a really good example of acting, is a much better work.Even though it was shot with one tenth of the budget of this film.Now, if only Hollywood film industry would give up this ""we are collecting everyone"" thing.The music by James Newton Howard is unbelievable... The film is just another Hollywood production where all the good names come together to make a mediocre work.",2023-10-29
"Really enjoyed everything about this film. Truly laugh out loud moments from perfect edit timing. The story arc, the music anchors, the character arcs all on point, the star power, the comical nods to the actor's past films, the portrayal of the sales industry and the drug problem being faced in the US and the mise-en-scene all come together for a tour-de-force For example, the moment the CEO is asked to to lie for Dr Neel and there is a shot of a live dog with a soft toy dog next to it, you know it's comparing the dog with the CEO being kept happy and comfortable through his family by Dr Neel's manipulations. Masterful film making!",2023-10-28
"Here is a well-written movie that provides viewers with a look at all sides of the debacle created by opioid prescription abuse. Manufacturers, doctors, sales reps, and of course patients are not spared. Unlike fictionalized movies about the 2008 Great Recession, which failed to assign blame to all the willing participants, Pain Hustlers rationed out the damage fairly, culminating in the final court scene.Emily Blount plays the likable Liza Drake as a down and out mom willing to do what it takes for her daughter. She leads a strong cast of complex characters balanced by Chris Evans and Andy Garcia. Brian d'Arcy James gets my vote for Best Supporting Actor.Pain Hustlers is worthwhile investment of your time.",2023-10-27
"I believe this is one of the best representations of the real-life affair that goes behind the logos of most pharma companies.Emily Blunt played very well again, showing that she is a big actress, and her variety of characters portray her professionalism. I was astonished by how well she played it, but also by what her character symbolized. Morality is something rare these days, and even less visible around Big Pharma-related businesses.Now, they explain 10 stars, the acting was great, and an overall good impression. Also, the cast played out almost as if it was all real. I also have relatives in the medical system who have been targeted but never accepted.It's a business, and the only interest is in having more money, and spending more, no matter the consequences for people's lives.I trust this movie will open other's people minds to the importance of knowledge in any field, especially when it comes to our health.",2023-10-29
"I enjoyed the film, and I have to say I didn't know the story behind it. It is an interesting theme but the movie tried to be more like a Wolf of Wall Street than to be authentic.My problem with this is that the timings don't look right, she didn't even finish high school, but was proficient with the numbers in terms of commissions and growth? Plus she started one day and in less than a week the company grew, and by the time six months passed she already had stock valued on $15 million?Not even a year passed and there were deaths, incarcerations, repentance, surgery and trial? I think the creative liberties taken by the movie in order to give it a bit of context ended up impacting the credibility of the story. And at the end she gets a 15 month sentence but after that time she has a new company and is thriving? No explanations no notes at the end. I think it needed a bit of work on the script to make it more credible.",2023-10-30
"This film, by the very good director David Yates, who has excelled in many genres, is definitely very much worth checking out.The actors all do an incredible job, truly career defining acts, and some of their better performances for sure. All of this, of course, accompined by a very good script, very important, eye-opening and real.The cinematography, cutting and editing is very good, and the film is all around very beautifully put together.Overall, a very important historical piece, that I would definitely recommend. Very well acted, directed and put together, and some important messages throughout it all.Recommended for any lover of film, and everyone else!",2023-11-01
"This is Hollywood's 3rd attempt at telling the big pharma/opioid crisis story. Each telling gets progressively worse. The first, Dopesick , was really good and took the time to tell a well rounded, well done story. Next was Painkiller, which is ok, but no Dopesick. And the third, and probably final, being this turkey.Emily Blunt is always good, but her costumes were terrible-so 1980s, just not on point or decade . Catherine O'Hara is miscast as the trashy mom, she just doesn't work- this isn't supposed to be a comedy. The other characters were over accented, poorly costumed and really just cartoons. At some points this did seem to be a comedy. The last 1/4 of this film is so rushed.It just didn't work and was a waste of time. I wonder what went wrong.",2023-10-28
"Great performance by Emily blunt and Chris Evans, but we MUST Reinforce Emily's Performance, she brings emotion to every scene she participates in,
Direction and Editing brought an excellent sequence of scenes and chronology that combined with a good soundtrack, the result could not be other: Suspense, Humor, Anxiety, Fear, Adrenaline, all telling a story based on facts real and leaving a review on the airThe film revolves around a simple plot that could have been told in a news story in less than 2 minutes, but this film shows that with a powerful cast, and in the hands of a good team, the story becomes something remarkable and worthy of a high note.",2023-10-30
"This film gives The Wolf of Wall Street meets Dopesick with a heavy dash of John Carter (iykyk).The acting from top to bottom was executed incredibly well. Emily Blunt held the screen brilliantly as she always does. Andy Garcia was a legend as always. I found beauty in the cinematography (but could have done without the mockumentary styling). I enjoyed the score. Point being.... It had incredible potential.However, in comparison to Dopesick, this film lacked the intrigue of that you'd want to see.It was hard to find a ton of empathy for Liza despite the desperation they attempted to evoke from her characters disposition. The sick daughter, the over the top mother (too type cast, my one casting squeamish). The living out of a hotel room. Even if all of these are details are actual facts, the way the story was delivered it didn't hit me with a feeling of a hero's journey.Liza Drake is no Jordan Belfort.But ONE BIG THING that is to note for me: I had never heard of Liza or Zanna or any of this scandal. In that sense, I'm grateful it was produced and that big pharma remains under attack in the media. I hope it continues, and creates lasting change against the greed and exploitation of companies who see people as $ signs.",2023-10-31
"Big Business America is moralising Big Pharma? Ha-ha!Without the wokeness it would have been a fun movie.Bankers, brokers, pharma reps et al do not come with a conscience, so I am annoyed of fairy-taling morals into them.And why do you think no CEO of Pfizer et al is in prison right now? You think they are better people? Better connected, even richer and decades of lobbying I would say.Doctors have been drug pushers since the beginning of time.Not saying people shouldn't go for malpractice suits, on the contrary, sue them all into bankruptcy.But people do not want responsibility for themselves. They want magicians in white coats to cure them. That includes illness and medication, and addiction.Next they'll be suing gun manufacturers for gunshot suicides. Joke. Or the sugar manufacturers for rotten teeth and diabetes. Or the rich for poor people dying because they cannot afford basic treatments. I'm just not into cherry-pick blaming.And Fentanyl is a great drug.First half was fun, then it turns boring in all its fake outrage and concern.A morality play? Ha-ha.",2023-10-29
"Typical, netflix, slop.Seeing emily blunt now doing netflix films shows you exactly where her career is, the bargain bin.Had to cringe extremely hard within the first 5 minutes, typical netflix level dialogue.The entire cast so badly wanted to do finger guns in every scene, theyre just that badarse and cool, but sadly even the director thought that was too much.What parallel universe do you have to be in to take any of this seriously, its so synthetic and cliche.Oh and everyone has an IQ of at least 1000, and theyre going to tell you about it!Made it 15mins in before having to turn it off, its that bad.Probably good to watch between tiktok scrolls bruh.",2023-10-31
"I've been really excited for this movie not just because the subject matter is interesting but I've also been really excited to see what David Yates can do fully outside of the Harry Potter Universe. I also think Emily Blunt is one of the best actresses around right now and is usually very reliable when it comes to picking projects. But unfortunately the end result just feels totally fine and sort of destined for the Netflix graveyard. Emily Blunt and Chris Evans are both on good form, it can be very informative and I certainly wouldn't say I was bored watching it. The problem is that it doesn't feel like it has anything substantial to say about this crisis it's trying to examine. It's feels all really surface level in it's execution and we've seen stories done like this before and better at that, Scorsese makes it looks easy but Pain Hustlers is a real example of why it isn't. Most of the conflicts that arise feel forced and end up resolved far too easily for how this script is trying to drive a wedge between these characters and pit them against each other. David Yates' direction also isn't much to write home about, it's pretty flat visually and any kind of flourish he adds just feels jarring because I don't think it's entirely clear what tone he was trying to go for with this movie. It's not the worst movie I've seen all year but absolutely one of the ones that feels most full of wasted potential.",2023-10-30
"And it does neither one well. This is like the poor man's version of wolf of Wall Street and obviously inspired by Erin bronkovich.I don't know much about the fentanyl problem in the US but I know it's a big deal and this movie just shows what a big sham the pharma industry is and it needs to be exposed.Coming back to the movie, I wish they didn't try to be a copycat version of other movies and tried to do something original.Overall it just felt like a cheap rip off. If you have nothing else to watch you can maybe watch this. That's about it. Nothing special here. Just another mediocre Netflix production.",2023-10-29
"Its close. They got the story. Its just missing a certain polish. Like they under budgeted the editing. The sound design is not where it should be. So often during the movie I'm thinking about why I'm hearing bad sound design. I think this movie could have been way better.Otherwise, its a good story. The story starts the protagonist with good motivate to do what she needed to do. But towards the end, she flipped too soon. Love it or hate it, everyone has a self preservation instinct. People will do bad things, knowing they are doing bad things, and still wont give in till a certain degree of pressure is on them so long as its very economically beneficial. And before it gets to that point, there is a lot of self destructing behaviors that come first. This movie did skipped a lot of that.So in the end, is it worth watching?Ya. Why not. But if you skip it, you did not really miss anything. I sure don't have any interest in watching it a second time, which is too bad because if they nailed the edit, it could have been a great movie.",2023-10-30
"What a movie, Emily Blunt terrific performance, she is at the full moon as actress and artist.Well directed and astonishing acting from the cast delivered very realistic.The director did a great job, especially when the momentum of the story hits the screen.I also loved the script and the costumes.On a different dimension this is the evil wear Prada nemesis, a great prospective of our modern society and how the pharmaceutical industry works.I definitely recommend you to watch it more than once because there is so much information into it that you will need time to absorb and process!!!",2023-11-01
"The movie strikes me as a cheap, ultra-simplified rip-off of Painkiller, and it also has some Erin Brockovich in it. The story and the performances are very decadent. The evolution of the characters is very grotesque. The main character seems out of context in his entire performance. Having seen the movie Painkiller it is easy to understand what is going to happen. The character played by Emily Blunt reminds me of Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich, but Julia plays that role excellently. It's a shame that there are so many good movies that don't have the marketing that this one has. On Netflix it is listed as the 2nd most popular film in Germany and I find it very strange.",2023-10-29
"This film engenders feelings of anger and sadness in that it diverts viewers from the reality of the problem of drug addiction. The film is fictional but inspired by a nonfictional newspaper article in 2018 expanded into a book in 2023. The article and book describe the role of a pharmaceutical company in falsely exaggerating the benefits while minimizing the dangers of the legal opioid fentanyl, eighty times more potent than morphine. The film loosely mimics the article and book describing the catastrophe surrounding the pharmaceutical marketing of fentanyl, represented by the fictitious name Lonifen. The marketing is claimed to have fueled the fentanyl crisis. However, in recent years the source of fentanyl has been through the illicit underground market.Opioids are addictive and fatal if the dose is too large. Deaths from illegal opioids of unknown strength are most often accidental and not deliberate. The death rate from fentanyl increased fourfold between 2016 and 2021 reaching an estimated 70,000 deaths in 2021. These deaths were predominantly among young people.Today, by far, the major source of fentanyl is illegal as opposed to legal. The death rate from fentanyl has risen in recent years due to complicity between China and Mexico. Chinese entities supply the precursor chemicals needed to make fentanyl and thus claim that they are not supplying the actual drug fentanyl. Mexican cartels then use these chemicals to manufacture the drug fentanyl. The Mexican government claims that the USA does not adequately address the problem of addiction, and that it is therefore not their problem. The fentanyl is delivered into the USA by the Mexican cartels and USA drug dealers. This can only be dealt with by the Federal and State USA governments which have failed to do so, especially with the porous borders of the entire USA, allowing for smuggling of the drug.This film is marginally productive in bringing further light to the problem. It is too inaccurate and incomplete. It therefore deserves a low rating as it is misleading.",2023-10-29
"I lasted barely two minutes into this shameful detritus before switching it off and deleting it. The acting was horrendously bad, and the script written by someone on the sort of medication highlighted in the movie. Was I supposed to just remember all the names spouted out in the opening scenes (by an actor whom would be better placed as a waiter in a cheap café), and their respective roles, through mere mention of them?Worse yet, there was a cut to an actress whom, without any prior warning, was talking while eating, which is absolutely repellent. Why did the director include this? Was it purposefully to disgust his audience, and to teach his audience bad manners? The movie I watched before Pain Hustlers was the original 1937 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. In that movie, Snow White took a bite from an apple, but did the audience even see her take the bite and did the audience hear her crunch the apple? No, because back in 1937 moviemakers had better manners than to inflict such things upon their audiences; they had respect, and they were civilised, quite unlike the director and producers of Pain Hustlers, whom clearly have no shame.This movie is a modern disgrace fit only for waste management.",2023-10-31
"I was looking forward to this movie because I'm a fan of both Chris Evans and Emily Blunt. Almost immediately I didn't like the pace of the movie. Because of who was in it I stuck it out and watched the whole this but just didn't enjoy it at all. Also, why do directors feel the need to make characters smoke? The whole movie was very slow. There have been so many movies and series lately on the opioid epidemic, many of which were very good but this one wasn't, as much as I like Chris Evans I didn't enjoy him in this movie. It almost felt like he was over-acting. Emily Blunt did a better job although I think she has done much better in other movies I've seen her in.",2023-10-31
"What is this, the fourth or fifth recent drama concerning opioids and big pharma? I mean, it's good to get the point out there but I think we get the picture.In saying that I did enjoy this movie. It did feel like it was struggling to stay entertaining at some points because, let's be honest, it's a pretty dry subject and actually pretty depressing in real life which is why they tried to make it like Wolf of Wall Street as much as possible.Emily, Chris and Andy carry the movie with the supporting cast doing well too, especially Catherine O'Hara who plays Emily's character's mum. She was very funny.Worth watching for Emily's performance if you're a fan but if you've already had your fill of big pharma companies getting their comeuppance then there's nothing really new here.",2023-11-02
"I always enjoy the movies that Emily Blunt is in, I thought I'd give it a try the story was intriguing, and it was a fresh character played by blunt. I mean Emily Blunt, but it seems to me the direction of the movie was going in the direction of Harry Potter movie, freeze frame, narration, and going through a montage of telling us, that time has passed Ala Martin Scorsese style. At 57 minutes into the movie things started going the wrong direction. I gave it to Five. I thought the acting was good between the two lead characters but all the other actors were mediocre were like cartoonish. I almost texted to friend to tell him I'm watching a great movie but I'm glad I did not.",2023-10-29
"I was extremely disappointed with this movie. Stated as based on true details, but exceptionally hard to believe that is the case here. Some ridiculously stupid lines and onerous mistakes in reference to the financial markets. Feel like script writer did absolutely no research. Easily one of Emily Blunt's worst turns. And absolutely ridiculous turn of events. Chris Evans was surprising, in what seemed like a very different role for him, perhaps that's why I didn't quit before the ending. Every chance they had to make this sad movie have a little heart, they blew it. You will need a pain killer if you last through this movie.",2023-11-01
How many ways can Netflix or any other streaming platform possible find to tell the same story over and over again. Pretty lady makes good selling potent new painkiller for multimillion dollar company.As great as Emily Blunt and Chris Evans are as actors they are unable to save this movie. It was a bore.It was a repeat of all the other big pharma stories that we have been inundated with in the last year or two.I recommend you completely skip this movie. Do not waste 2 hours of your time that you won't get back.What a shame. I was really looking forward to the release of this one. Expecting so much more.,2023-10-27
"Ah, the cinema of yesteryears! When storytelling was an art form, untainted by the garish lights of commercialism. ""Pain Hustlers,"" however, is a modern-day tale that harks back to the days when films were more than just moving pictures; they were a mirror to society.The film's protagonist, Liza Drake, portrayed with aching vulnerability by Emily Blunt, is a modern-day anti-heroine. Her journey from a struggling single mother to a cog in the wheel of a pharmaceutical giant is a tale as old as time, yet as fresh as the morning dew. It's a story that could have been penned by the likes of Tennessee Williams, had he been born in the era of Big Pharma.The screenplay, penned by Wells Tower, is a labyrinthine maze of ethical dilemmas and moral quandaries. It's a story that forces us to question the very fabric of our societal norms. The film's narrative is a rollercoaster ride through the murky waters of corporate America, where the line between right and wrong is as blurred as a Monet painting.The supporting cast, including Chris Evans and Catherine O'Hara, add layers to this already complex narrative. Evans, in particular, shines as the morally ambiguous Pete Brenner, a man whose ethical compass is as fluid as mercury.However, the film is not without its flaws. While it attempts to tackle the opioid crisis, it sometimes veers into the realm of melodrama, losing the subtlety that could have made it a modern classic.In conclusion, ""Pain Hustlers"" is a film that deserves to be watched, not just for its cinematic brilliance but for the questions it raises. It's a film that doesn't just entertain but educates, making it a must-watch in these trying times.So, dear readers, if you're in the mood for a film that combines the storytelling prowess of the Golden Age of Hollywood with the gritty realism of modern cinema, ""Pain Hustlers"" is the ticket for you.",2023-11-01
"I have been following her since ""The Devil Wears Prada"". She does not disappoint. I enjoy most everything she has been in. She's gorgeous and she definitely knows how to put on a show. With her latest movie here, this is quite a different role for her. She swung, and knocked it out of the park! Great story telling along with her co-star Chris Evans which they both have great chemistry onscreen. It will pull you in, in the first 5 minutes. If you want a good drama story to watch after work, and wind down the day, this is it! This is the meaning of Netflix & Chill. Sit back and enjoy the show.......",2023-10-31
"Just odd and weird. The movie is not believable. The cast is odd and the scenes are weird. I found it hard to believe anyone was a depiction of a real person.just a weird movie that I couldn't get through.I don't know why they thought they had to make such an odd film. No idea why
But all seem miscast
It seems like they were all playing phoney in their roles The cast is so miscast!!I didn't like anything about it at all.Sorry I went in thinking I'd like it but I can't get through. I tried it for 45 minutes and won't be watching the rest of it. It was not the kind of character driven movie that I like.",2023-10-31
"Remember back when 'Deep Impact' came out the same summer as 'Armageddon' and when 'Robin Hood' was released at the same time as 'Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves'.? Well unfortunately this film is basically the movie version of Mathew Broderick's Limited Tv Series 'Painkiller'. It may be a bit glossier and have some bigger names by way of Emily Blunt, Chris Evans, Catherine O'Hara and Andy Garcia, but it pretty much follows a similar story and hits all the same beats. In a nutshell a huge pharmaceutical company in the US, starts bribing local doctors to sign off prescriptions, of there addictive opioid pain killing medication, Blunt and Evans are the company salesmen getting rich and recruiting new blood, willing to do anything to make cash and obviously we get to the inevitable FDA investigation. Unfortunately the star power doesn't really make it superior in this case and both the main characters are pretty unlikable, so you don't really bother about what happens to them.! Based on different a true story and on Netflix now.!",2023-10-31
"I am going to say something rather controversial; it shouldn't be (in my opinion), but it is:""If a true story is worth telling, it is worth telling the way it happened.""This film proports to be based on true events. That is not true. It might be said to be /inspired/ by true events, but those true events are not depicted in any way, shape, or form in this movie. The elements of truth in the movie are so rare and so altered as to be fiction. The story is just plain fiction.The characters are /very, very loosely/ based on amalgams of people involved in the story they claim to be telling, but the amalgam is diluted with so much fictionalization as to make them fictional. The characters are just plain fiction.And this is my point.If you want to tell a fictional story, then tell one. Just do not claim to be telling a story that is true, or based on the truth. Tell your fictional tale and call it a fictional tale and leave the truth out of it.If you want to tell a true story, then tell one. I am not saying you need to make a documentary. I am saying tell the story with the characters that were involved; have them doing the things they did. Be honest! If their are gaps in the story, then extrapolate as best you can and fill the gaps -- but do it honestly.This approach worked for Gore Vidal when he did his novelizations (e.g., Lincoln). You can write a screenplay that is true to the individuals and events of the story without turning the film into a documentary. It can be done.If the various individuals involved in this had portrayed this as a fiction and nothing but a fiction, I would have rated this film higher. But at this point, I have just seen too many 'based on true events' movies that are fiction in disguise for me to be tolerant of this crap any longer. I am just done with the lies.",2023-10-31
"Charasmetic leads. Though hard to watch Captain America as an ass#ole. There have been so many shows recently about the OxyContin epidemic. This one suffers because it's at the end of the line. At least it's not an 8 part series that takes forever to tell the same story. Catherine O'Hara in a non comedic role is a joy to watch., Andy Garcia ... used to be an A class actor. Seems a bit desperate to have taken on this role. Still ... it's an important lesson. The role of big chemical companies in modern society and how they prey on the vulnerable is highlighted. Which is a good thing. Not that this will change anything.",2023-10-31
"Ti West's movie really should have been called ""E"" for elevated. It sets itself up as a smart take on the slasher films of the 70s and early 80s. As a bonus, the film within a film has the filmmakers making an 'elevated' porn flick (as a bonus, actor Owen Campbell who plays the ""Director"" even looks a bit like Director Tobe Hooper).Quite consciously taking it's set up from Tobe Hooper's 1974 TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, X has a group of randy pornographers renting a farmhouse from an elderly couple in the middle of nowhere in Texas (actually New Zealand). Writer-Director West's main idea here is to set up a contrast between the XXX filmmakers and the bible thumping civilians of the area. It's not an uninteresting idea, which, of course, plays off the the puritanical cliche in the slasher films of yore where the most sexually active characters are the most likely to g et killed off. In addition to MASSACRE, West includes nods to FRIDAY THE 13TH, Hooper's EATEN ALIVE and a very specific one to HALLOWEEN. X is set about 5 years after MASSACRE so that it can include a brief exchange about how home video will change the porno industry (adult films were already available on VHS for about 3 years).The movie is very well directed, with savvy use of cross-cutting between the porn film in the making and the terrors that await the group. Mia Goth (in a dual role; actually a triple if you stay after the credits) and Brittany Snow are the two pornstars to be and each dive in with relish. Kid Cudi is the cocky stud, while Martin Henderson is solid as the confidant Producer. Jenna Ortega is the ""crew"" all by her lonesome (she manages to keep her clothes on - must have a better agent). Stephen Ure is the ornery old man who rents out his guest house.As good as the filmmaking is, X ends up feeling too studied. The pacing is lugubrious even if it picks up towards the very end. Once the massacre begins (if not by power tools) it still ends up being fairly typical of the films it's commenting on, regardless of how well executed and 'elevated' it thinks it is. It's also too drawn out to satisfy some gore-hounds and once the blood starts flowing, probably too gross for the internet scribes dreaming of doing extended online essays dissecting it for it's elevated intellect. There are a couple of twists, but they aren't sufficient enough to compensate for the predictability.In the end, it's not as clever as West thinks it is, and despite some good Directing chops and acting, it's simply too self-conscious to be much of a fun thrill ride.",2022-03-31
"I liked it. It's a nice old-fashioned (flawlessly 70's styled) slasher horror-flick, with a fairly original premise. As in any comparable horror movie the motives for the killings are pretty farfetched, but who cares, when they are pictured so relentlessley gruesome, the gore here is definitely not for the tender-hearted. Another strong point is how the movie very gradually builds up the tension, this is a real slow burner, the apprehension of looming doom is palpable throughout the movie. This is helped by a strong direction, a very clever and inventive editing, and some great photography, see for instance the scene of one of the girls swimming in the lake, while... well, I won't give it away, but it's beautiful and hair-raisingly scary at the same time!Add to all this some very funny dialogues and goings-on at the start, and you're in for a well made, old-school horror flick, maybe not life-changing but absolutely entertaining for those who can apprciate this kind of movie (like me!).",2022-03-16
"My expectations were quite high for this film ... After watching it , I just don't understand what's all the hype is about ? To call it mediocre is to make a compliment ! Slow , predictable , not very clever horror , which is not even a horror , just an unrealistic portrayal of mayhem based on sex... Highly not recommended !",2022-04-16
"5/10 - while it was nice to see Brittany Snow on the big screen again after the Pitch Perfect movies and it continued Jenna Ortega's Hollywood takeover, this utterly bizarre, inconsistent, and incomplete attempt at a ""sexy slasher"" starts off strong but a few moments aside, becomes utterly laughable in the last 45 minutes.",2022-03-19
"I didn't know what to expect going into this movie. Some reviews said it was porn with some horror, some said it was a slasher B movie. Some said decent acting and a good gore fest.It was all of the above, though I'd say less porn, there are some nude/sex scenes but they're really not the heart of the movie. The gore is well done, the acting is very good I think, and the overall slasher aspect is reasonable, though it could have been a little more creative.Saying all of that none of it is what I'll remember this movie for. What really struck me in this movie was the portrayal of age and how it affects people and their relationships, I actually felt really sad for some of the characters in this movie, and that isn't usually how I'd expect to feel watching a slasher. It really did feel like the writers, directors,. And actors were trying to remind us of something whilst also making a decent slasher. I think it's to value our youth, and our lives as much as we can. I don't want to say much more as I don't want to spoil the movie. Needless to say if you're looking for a decent movie to check out I'd recommend giving this a go. It will entertain you and also make you think a little about the problems others have.",2022-04-15
"An interesting slow burn, but without enough to make it stand against the countless other slasher films, X is a fine film and another tribute to the iconic genre that made horror so popular in the first place. Granted, I do enjoy myself a slasher film from time to time- I'm quite fond of films like Nightmare on Elm Street and My Bloody Valentine, but where X faults among the others is through using a rather familiar formula without any true unique purpose. Throughout the film the characters often talk about an X factor, something that makes Mia Goth's character special and starworthy- but unlike its mentionings- this film just doesn't have that. The acting is really good, I love the underrated Mia Goth as always- as well as Brittany Snow, Martin Henderson, and even Kid Cudi did a rather impressive job. The cinematography is fantastic and perfectly fits the amitpshere and tone the film is going for. The music is enjoyable and tense, and its pacing can be a bit slow at times, but does allow for an interesting point of view. Its main problem lies solely in its script, which revolves largely around a smut film production- but takes too many elements and formulaic tendencies from other horror films like Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, The Visit and most obviously Texas Chainsaw Massacre to really stand out on its own and become its own thing. In the end, its not a bad watch, I wouldn't watch it again, but I certainly didn't mind watching it. It isn't the most memorable, but I certainly don't have any disdain for it. It just could have been more, especially given the talent involved, but ironically it settled for less.My Rating: 5.8/10.",2022-04-02

"While I knew this film was presented as a slasher film going in, I had better expectations given it was an A24 Studios film. Despite some of the famous names in the cast, I wouldn't consider it good. Probably my least favorite from the A24 films. The film is made in the cinematography style of classic 1970s slasher films, but it holds back on the brutality with the females. I really wished A24 was above PC culture.True 70s slasher/horror films were very brutal with both genders but not this one except perhaps with the old woman/zomb-et at the end.I was hoping at least a slightly smarter screenplay given it is A24, but disappointingly no. Mia Goth was probably the only likable character in the film. But I feel the special effects people overdid the prosthetics with the old couple. They resemble zombie monsters far more than the elderly. They could have placed a real elderly couple in there instead. Yes, the film does have some gore and blood but its predominately a very tame film. The worst of it all is a disembowel cow hit by a truck on the highway. It's not even part of the main story and we also see the aftermath of the accident.I don't feel the film deserves to be elevated because of the technical production. Authentic 1970s low budget B films were not technically sophisticated in camera work and lighting. The fancy lighting and best cinematographers of the time were reserved for mainstream big studio films and not low budget horror. With today's pre-fab software plugins templates for adobe software, copying the style wasn't an Einstein endeavor. Had this film been made by any other no name production studio, it would have been relegated into another Netflix Original category and not given accolades. The recent Netflix Texas Chainsaw original from 2022 is just as good a film as this one minus the famous actors.",2022-03-20
"Paying homage to the slashers of yesteryear is nothing new, but Ti West's new movie X makes it feel fresh. He does this by primarily bringing attention to the sex parts of the genre and exploring what sex means. This is, after all, in part about a crew of people attempting to make a porno. But the sex angle goes beyond just cheap titillation. It is at the heart of the film, and West seems to be most interested in what the experience means, whether it's for love, a way to recapture youth, or getting the most out of life while one is still capable of experiencing the act.Beyond all this, though, is a fun, classically styled slasher that is equal parts titillation and slasher mayhem. Some may find the amount of nudity and sex, and heck the subject matter itself, distasteful, but for slasher fans, this will remind you of much of the early years of the genre. A lot has been made about how this is so heavily inspired by Texas Chainsaw Massacre and it's easy to see why. The majority of the film revolves around the singular location, an old farm seemingly in the middle of nowhere, Texas, ripe for plenty of slasher fun. Ti doesn't skimp on the red stuff either. While nothing gets too outlandishly creative, we do get some brutal kills with often gory results.It helps that characters are written well and likable. Despite the sleazy material they're attempting to create, they don't feel shallow or sleazy themselves. They believe in their work and the reasons for making it. While it may have been nice to get a little more depth out of them, they clearly have history and there are things hinted at that never get much development, they're at least a decent crowd of folks who are fun to be around. As for the villains, they're not quite as out there or mysterious as the trailer would lead you to believe. In fact, they're pretty grounded, but never the less creepy and tension is maintained consistently once the violence starts.If you know what the film's about, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. It does take some unusual turns, but for me that only added to just how much the film stood on it's own. It certainly feels like a fresh entry into the slasher genre, something the genre needs. Ti West continues to make a name for himself as someone to watch out for. Have fun with this sexy, bloody good time.",2022-03-18
"In 1979 a bunch of young filmmakers set out to rural Teaxas to film a porno film. They rent a cabin in the middle of nowhere from an old guy. They begin filming but the old guy and his wife have other plans. Soon the young people are fighting for their lives.This is a very odd film. It's a solid hour before any horror kicks in but when it does it's VERY bloody, gruesome and pretty sick. However it is well-done, the acting is good and there is plenty of female and male frontal nudity. Also I love how the opening and closing credits look like they came off an old porno flick! Worth a look but the buildup to the blood and guts is kind of slow.",2022-03-31
"After reading the plot, I expected to see a generic slasher movie, however, what I got was a boring artsy-wannabe flick, which takes itself way too seriously and ends up being devoid of soul or any kind of entertainment.After 1 HOUR of extremely slow and tedious build-up you get presented by the most pathetic horror movie villains I have seen in my entire life. Scree-writer must have a serious phobia of frail old people, because that's the only way you'll find any kind of thrills in this movie.With a pretentious façade, one might think that such a movie would at least be devoid of clichés, but they are all there - loud sound jump scares, extremely dumb victims, completely unrealistic kills, which you see coming a mile away, and one of the most pathetic endings to the slasher movie ever.Just go rewatch Texas Chainsaw Massacre - both originals and remakes are a million times more entertaining than this boring mess.",2022-05-26
"X (2022) is a recent horror from Ti West that feels like a homage to THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE complete with '70s trappings and grindhouse feel. The story is about the actors and crew of a low budget porn shoot heading to a remote cabin owned by a couple of oldsters. All goes well until nightfall, when murderous intentions arise and things soon turn into a night of terror. I hadn't liked West's CABIN FEVER 2 or HOUSE OF THE DEVIL and didn't expect to like this either, and - surprise! - I hated it.It's not a slow burner (for a change) but it is void of horror content, or any interesting content at all really. For the first hour nothing happens apart from time-wasting with annoying characters, bad dialogue, and endless sex scenes that smack of padding. In the last 45 minutes it becomes a fairly gory but unconvincing slasher, with bad makeup and more cliches than you can shake a stick at. It's the film's senselessness that really got to me, like the female crew member who suddenly decides she wants to star in the shoot. Yeah, okay, that would happen.",2022-11-02

"Instead of getting a horror movie of the 70's, you watch a group of junkies going to make a porn movie on a farm, which turns out to be nothing but a long drawn out build-up, before they get wiped out but one. Some people call it a slow burner, but they're wrong, it doesn't even get lit.",2022-04-14
People rating this 9 and 10. Did we watch the same movie? Its a hilariously bad slasher. Just the premise of it is enough to stay away from it. 6 adults get terrorized and murdered by a couple 90 year olds that can barely move. Yeah you read that right. Imagine not knocking out a 90 year old that moves with the speed of a turtle. Waste of time.,2022-05-01
"""X"" is a very bloody, and satisfying horror film from A24 that is able to pack enough scary moments, while also talking it's time to develop its characters.The good in this movie right off the bat is the performances. Everyone in the movie is great. The standouts here are Mia Goth and Jenna Ortega. These two were great. The movie also has a really strong message about sex and what it really means for these people. It's a very strong message and it works. The gore here is also great. It's a very bloody movie and the final 40 minutes are amazing. It's also a very good looking movie. It's very well shot and there's a lot of creepiness to it. And finally I actually felt that the villains in this movie were actually very well portrayed. They were given a somewhat tragic issue, and it really added a lot to them.Now I do have a few negatives. The first being that I do wish there was a little more crazy moments. I wish the movie had just a little more bloody moments. I also felt that the first act, while good, was a little too slow paced. I wish it do move a lot faster. And finally there are some things aren't fully explained towards the end.Overall ""X"" is a very bloody good time with great acting, great direction, and some truly bloody moments.",2022-03-19
"A very stylish rendition of original porn leading to some brilliant horror set in 1979 that is well written and fun to watch! X is surprising in all the right ways and very weird reminds me of M. Nights The Visit just more extreme. I was surprised to see Sam Levinson's name in the credits I love him and his projects! Ti West created something special, I've seen a couple of his films he seems to gear towards disturbed older folks which is quite effective.",2022-03-18
I can't with movies full of characters that just walk around without any instinct doing the absolute dumbest things they could possibly choose before they're murdered. It's literally the whole movie. The 'action and gore' is actually pretty tame. The sex is explicit. The characters are idiots.,2022-03-24

"It isn't a porno movie, it isn't an erotic movie, it isn't an horror or suspenceful movie.It isn't anything, but a total waste of time.Takes too long for anything to finally happen and when it does, it is totally predictable.What a terrible waste of time watching sex clichés, exagerated old age stereotypes and a complete lack of suspence, horror or anything worthwile.Why even bother wasting money or time filming this?",2022-04-24
"Ti West is back - I have to admit since we had a pandemic I didn't really think or realize he was gone. Something I only heard from others that this is his ""comeback"" piece. Again not how I view it, but nevermind that, enjoy this horror movie that also has a sexual tone to it ... and quite a lot of innuendo.The sex is not just there to titilate of course (although I was more than surprised to see Brittany Snow show what she is blessed with), no it serves the story and especially one of the many themes we have here. There is a discussion about being young, living life to the fullest or at least to an extent that makes one happy. Before you get old and have too many regrets. Young vs old is something you could say. But the less you know going in, the better you will be able to receive.The acting is good and not just from the clearly younger people in old age makeup (look at in the credits who is playing the woman if you have not realized it while you were watching). Effects are top notch, though not for the faint hearted ... you cannot be too squeamish.Go in this ride, that while a serious slasher, is not with a touch (or more) of dark humor. And if you read some innuendo in what I just wrote ... well you may not be entirely wrong about coming ... to that conclusion.",2022-04-09
A man looking for a get rich quick scheme decides to make a porn film on a Texas ranch in the video days of 1979. The place is owned by a creepy old couple who look like ma and pa kettle. The old lady is both horny and violent and a scene with geriatric peop!e getting busy is downright bizarre. The leads are fine but X is only an average horror movie.,2022-04-15
"This is a technically well-made movie. It's a slow burn but I was never bored. I was enjoying it and curious to see what comes next. Until it got weird. And gross. This is coming from someone who watches tons of horror and gore. That wasn't the problem. The gore is one of the movie's best qualities.But the direction they take with some of the ""horror"" late in the movie is off-putting. I understand what they are going for. I understand that's the point. And the point does come across. It still doesn't change how I felt. Which was unsettled, not scared.Some people might like that type of ""horror"" (like Gabe from The Office lol). I am not one of those people. It's unfortunate because it's a good setup that just doesn't land for me. (1 viewing, opening night 3/17/2022)",2022-03-18

"Nothing like I expected it to be.I was aware that there was a pornographic element, but I think it focused too much on that.I was expecting them to get caught mid-scene...and then spend the remainder of the film running away from an unknown killer, that picks them all off one-by-one.But the killing doesn't start until well into the 2nd act...and from that point onwards, the film just drags. It's also really dark, so it's hard to tell what's going on a lot of the time.The killings are boring and unoriginal.The cast are dull and lacklustre.The cinematography is basic and the sound is terrible - especially the weird sound they play for the jump scares.Hated this and now I hate all the people involved.Absolute wasters!",2022-04-23
"I was about to go see Pearl then read that it's based on X in the synopsis so I thought I should view this first. And the fact that a second movie was released so soon after it's first gave me hope. It's not as good as I expected but I don't think it could have been that much better. My concept of horror is a movie that's supposed to scare you and this really doesn't; it's becoming more common for movies to throw in a couple gory scenes and death then labeling it horror. Can't call it a thriller either 'cause it didn't have me at the edge of my seat. The premise is pretty original I'll give it that but it's just not scary. Should be executed better. It's slow paced so it feels like it's building up to something and when it comes it's all over pretty quickly and I never really felt any tension in the life or death scenes. I didn't care for any of the characters either. More effort was put into the adult movie being made than put into actually frightening you.The directors artistic abilities are there, trying to have the same feel as old slasher movies from the 70's. It's pretty forgettable and horror movies shouldn't be, they should make you wanna sleep with the light on. If anything the only reason I'll have trouble sleeping at night is getting the image of two grotesquely old people have sex. When the credits rolled I was trying to recall what made me think this was going to be good.",2022-09-17

I'm guessing most if not all of the sparkling reviews, of which there are a ton, are fake.At least 30 minutes was of nothing happening, with long, slow, boring shots. It was barely interesting and towards the end became repugnant and repelling. The old man effects just looked dumb. The fact that this has so many 7-10 ratings and all the fake reviews is just sad. I watched because I liked West's Cabin Fever 2 and The Sacrament; this was nowhere near as good.",2022-04-18
"A decent slasher, but does not deserve a 96% rating on RT. The kills felt conveniently cheap and honestly everything was underwhelming.

"While the premise of this movie seemed promising at the start, the end result is less than mediocre.The acting feels extremely unnatural. Every step and every move is scripted, almost like watching a video game. Not to mention the fake southern accents.The directing is as generic as you can expect from a movie that wants to be 70s slasher so badly with too many jump squares and no actual proper suspense. The editing seems pretentious and wannabe edgy with the weird split second cuts back and forth, but in the end it's just very annoying.Overall, the movie is just very predictable and doesn't bring anything new. Characters still make the same stupid decisions that get them into trouble, but that also makes it less scary, because you know you wouldn't be as dumb as them.",2023-01-24

"This movie was just a bunch crap strung together with random scenes meant to try to make it seem better than it is.The first half of the movie nothing happens (6 people make a porno) and is entirely unrelated to the second half.There's a musical interlude for no reason. I can only guess it's there because Brittany Snow, from Pitch Perfect is in it and she wanted a chance to sing.Then, 2 old people, who can barely seem to move, end up slaughtering everyone, for basically no reason. I guess they're just supposed to be crazy insane. (not a spoiler as it's in the trailer)I liked It Follows. I can't say I liked Color Out of Space but it at least liked that it was trying something different. I didn't like Brightburn. I loved Green Room. I hated this movie!",2022-04-17
"X (2022) ***1/2 Mia Goth, Jenny Ortega, Brittany Snow, Kid Cudi, Martin Henderson, Owen Campbell, Stephen Ure. Filmmaker Ti West's valentine to '70s horror works its grind house magic with a foreboding tale about a group of friends circa 1979 who embark on a road trip to film a porno and get more than they bargained for while setting up shop on a creepy elderly couple's Texas farm in the middle of nowhere. The genre tropes are all there - the tension, eerie camera shots (thanks to cinematographer Eliot Rockett), grungy atmosphere (production designer Tom Hammock has a field day), a spooky sound design (by Graham Reznick) and genuinely unsettling make-up (designed with craft and skill by a team led by Michael Kenna). A fine ensemble with a surprising double role for Goth (as the lead actress with stardom in her eyes and the more than she seems old lady) keeps you glued to the screen with each moment of dread.",2022-04-08

"After being involved in some great modern horror films such as Hereditary (2018) and Saint Maud (2019), A24's latest film is an immature mess that feels more like an exercise in superfluity than it is a meaningful narrative.Set in 1979, X follows six Americans as they arrive at an isolated farmhouse for a weekend, intent on shooting a porno. Hosted by an unsettling, elderly couple, things soon turn into a full-blown bloodbath.Obviously inspired by Tobe Hooper's classic, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), writer-director Ti West ensured that X was full of slasher tropes, adding little originality to an already saturated genre. Where it does succeed is creating characters with some personality. Mia Goth's Maxine is noticeably unstable but tries to believe that she is a star. Bobby-Lynne, played well by Brittany Snow, comes across as the more witty, experienced porn actor. Jackson (Kid Cudi) is a Vietnam veteran, while Wayne (Martin Henderson) and RJ (Owen Campbell) provide the overseeing eyes to the pornographic production. Finishing off the cast, Jenny Ortega plays the outsider of the group, Lorraine.Lacking believable or serious motives, the killers in the film were nonetheless unique, providing some creepiness and mystery. However, this soon subsides as we learn their quite ludicrous reasons for their murderous streak. They will certainly not be remembered as iconic horror characters.From the beginning, the film uses themes of religion to juxtapose the vices taking place. The TV in the house shows a programme of a preacher discussing sin, which is repeated throughout the film. As well as this, a well-crafted shot of Lorraine taking off her cross while giving in to the temptation of being involved in the pornographic film hints at what could have been further developed. Unfortunately, the theme is only touched upon within the hour-forty-five runtime, in what seems a missed opportunity to flesh out the barren story.This slasher focuses too much on numerous scenes of nudity in the first half of the film which then mostly moves aside to allow for excessive gore. The extended sex scenes are used in place of well-written dialogue and provide little else than what you would expect. It seems as if Ti West had more of an interest in indulging in some sort of manic sex-gore film than providing any substance to this horror show. And while the gore was well executed with some great effects on display, they are at times over the top and not for the faint of heart.The editing of the film was unique, but rather out of place. Alongside this, X lacked adequate direction, with suspense in short supply and predictability with every kill. The film did not use perspective enough and could have created further tension within scenes by narrowing the viewer's vision and creating a more personal point of view.Without a strong plot, X fails to create a memorable story and instead focuses on showing something more akin to a pornographic film and a gore-fest. The killers were boring and the kills felt formulaic. Decently written characters could not make up for some of the bizarre dialogue and while gore was in abundance suspense was not.",2022-03-20
"I had high hopes of the latest Ti West movie but it turned out to be a bit of a damp squib. Not scary in the slightest neither is it funny or sexy. West's trade mark gore has been toned down perhaps to get a wider audience but the movie fails to make up for that in other ways. I just couldn't care less about the characters, a bunch of sexual degenerates making a porno and the constant references to Christianity by way of a TV evangelist is just lazy writing. On the plus side I guess X could be viewed as a morality tale, bad stuff happens to those who do bad things but is that enough? No it isn't. Distinctly average ( at best ).",2022-04-15
"In 1979 a group of people rent a cabin to make an adult film in rural Texas. The owner is less than pleased and has issues of his own with his wife.The film is over-hyped. It does have two creepy looking old people who look like something out of Texas Chainsaw. The soundtrack was top rate, as is anything that includes Mungo Jerry. It also has the throwback nudity many horror films have started to avoid. This film reminded me of ""Bread Crumbs.""Guide: F-word, sex, nudity (Mia Goth, Brittany Snow)",2022-04-17
"X (2022) is a movie my wife and I caught in theatres tonight. The storyline follows a production crew who rents an old house from a very old couple in the middle of nowhere in Texas to film a porno. As they make an outstanding porno hoping to change the industry forever they get some visitors looking to fulfill their own fantasies.This movie is directed by Ti West (The House of the Devil) and stars Mia Goth (Suspiria), Jenna Ortega (Scream), Brittany Snow (Pitch Perfect), Kid Cudi (Don't Look Up), Martin Henderson (The Ring) and Owen Campbell (My Heart Can't Beat Unless You Tell it To).I love everything about this movie, how can you not like a slasher porno movie? The storyline is excellent and unfolds perfectly. This is a rare unique slasher film that horror fans have been clamoring for. I really liked the characters, the twists and turns and the full circle ending. The cast was perfectly selected. The cinematography and camera angles are out of this world, as is the use of lighting, sounds and the soundtrack. The kill scenes, gore and blood splatter are on point. The jump scares are perfectly executed and very well done with no cheese.This movie gives horror fans everything they want in a horror movie. I could watch this 100 times. I would score this a 10/10.",2022-03-20
I only gave it 1 star because it's supposed to be a horror genre but i couldn't stop laughing at how funny it was and also how bad it was also. You seriously have to be wrong in the head to come up with plots like this of two ugly old as anything pensioners having sex. And to think they've filmed or started filming part 2 of this rubbish.,2022-03-21
Average acting with an extremely predictable story. Was hoping for more but the writers apparently thought viewers wanted the same old boring crap that's been done countless times.,2022-03-25
"Ti West is an incredibly astute visual director, and with X, he continues to show this. He turns this farmhouse into one of the most hellish nightmares imaginable, where there is no place that is truly safe.That being said, West has never impressed me with his writing before. His earlier films have very little detail put into the characters and themes-they're all concept and little substance. Thankfully that's changed with this one. This is probably West's most character-filled film.Every single character in this story is incredibly flawed, yet still retains a shred of sympathetic humanity. The protagonists live too much in the moment with no regard for future consequences, while the film's villains yearn for a bygone era of their lives and harbor envy toward those who have what they have lost. Each group represents an untenable human desire, and it adds a layer of melancholy to the terror that unfolds.It's not a perfect film; like pretty much all slasher films, there are some characters who exist just to get killed off in predictable fashion, and some death scenes come off as rather anticlimactic.Additionally, because every character kind of sucks as a person, there's a two-edged sword in that none of them are particularly likeable and I didn't get attached to them in the way I think West wanted me to.Still, this is quite a wild, effectively uncomfortable ride, and a far smarter one than I was expecting.",2022-03-18
"OK, is this movie a cross between Boogie Nights and Texas Chainsaw Massacre? Let's find out.It must be noted that I'm watching this at 4pm with the sun still up. (Does one have to watch a movie at night to add to the effectiveness of the creepy nature?)
Movie starts off with a Sawyer homestead crime scene where sheriff Danny Glover combs the aftermath. He then steps right into a scene ripped right from ""Just Cause"" as the religious TV mumbles out some preacher rhetoric. ""Sheriff? You ought to take a look at this,"" informs the second in charge. Yeah, let the sheriff see it but don't show the audience. That's some Alfred Hitchcock leave-it-up-to-the-imagination stuff right there.This Wayne clown is doing his hardest to look and sound like Matthew McConaughy as is this movie's similarity to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Isn't this the same gas station as that recent Texas Chainsaw Massacre on Netflix?Won't surprise me if they pick up a hitchhiker next.Wow, this movie's biting so many scenes from Texas Chainsaw it's not funny. This Maxine character is even wearing Pam's red short shorts. It's also the same front door, same staircase. Is Leatherface hiding back there somewhere? You can pay homage to a movie but not steal directly from it.So, what are they gonna steal from next - the boat in the river scene from ""I Spit on Your Grave?"" Oh, it's ""Lake Placid,"" my mistake.This Maxine chick looks a lot like the blonde from Abba in the face. Especially around the eyes with the blue eye shadow.I'm still undecided if this old man looks like Robert Duvall, Uncle Leo, Willie Nelson or that hunchback thing from Rocky Horror.The possessive cameraman in the movie, who looks like Jarod Leto by the way, his curious girlfriend cheats on him and he cries like a baby before becoming the first victim in the movie. It's real cheap of this movie to steal Halloween's Blue Oyster Cult song. Another low blow.At certain times and angles this looks like the Evil Dead cabin as well.I wonder if that's Johnny Knoxville under those old people's body suits?I love in Hollywood movies how they exaggerate people flying through the air when it comes to shotguns, (Lethal Weapon.) A shotgun may dislocate your shoulder but it won't project you four feet backwards through the air. I saw a boar once take 3 shots from a boom stick and it stood its ground.For the record this modern movie did not capture the essence of the seventies, no sir. Not in the slightest. Modern day entertainment ain't leaving its mark on history. They're disposable throw away rubbish you only watch once and are then quickly forgotten.The recent Texas Chainsaw Massacre on Netflix was filmed in Bulgaria. This knockoff ""X Massacre"" clone was filmed in New Zealand. The state of Texas is being poorly misrepresented as of late.What's the matter Hollywood can't you film on real site locations anymore due to it being too expensive?A cast of porn actors, and film crew, travel out into the countryside of New Zealand where they pay fifty bucks for a cabin to film R-rated porn.The 2 geriatric hick homeowners of the land of fluffy clouds detest their inner city ways from the get-go and make this known causing a gulf of distrust. They resent them making love on their grounds and seek retribution because of jealousy and age bracket.By film's end you feel nothing, and hey, that's today's modern entertainment for ya.",2022-04-23
"'The House of the Devil' is one of my favorite horror movies in the last couple decades, but since then Ti West has made continuously awful movies. I really wanted to like this but the premise is pretty lame, and once the motive is revealed about the antagonists, I seriously thought I was getting trolled. I almost walked out of the theater a couple times but hoped the ending would pay off or introduce an interesting twist. Nothing.I can't wrap my head around this high ratings and reviews.",2022-03-21
"It's funny, I like porn. I like slasher movies. But when this movie put the two together, well, it's not like the person who first decided to put peanut butter and chocolate together, that person was a frickin' genius.For one thing, it's not exactly cutting edge. Pretty much every slasher movie in the 1980's have a certain element of soft core porn in them anyway. As for the 1970's look and shooting style. Again not overly impressed. To have actors who look like they could be from the seventies, the feather hair, the clothes, but the more I think about it, it feels like it's because of movies made in the 1970's that I think people looked and acted and talked that way than because they really are from the 1970's.The point is there wasn't one character I was particularly interested in. They all seemed to be cliches of cliches, the blond, the Linda Lovelace wannabe, the guy with the gasoline pump in his pocket. And most of that seemed to be cribbed from movies like Boogie Nights (not to mention When Harry met Sally), they're not just doing porn, they're doing art movies and of course they have their own little world in which they look out for each other, they're like a family with a little church mouse too.Again it's one of those movies where as soon as a character disappears for more than two minutes, I completely forget they were even in the movie. Oh yeah, I forgot about the one in the cellar, how's her hand again? What happened to the blond, she still alive, oh yeah, there she is sleeping.Which is the point, first they do the porn stuff and then they do the killing stuff, one by one, off the go. Which as another reviewer mentioned, I guessed absolutely every way they were going to be killed. Not even one was a surprise. The only thing I messed up on was the order in which they were killed. After the first guy got killed, I figured it would probably be the blond, boy, girl, boy, girl. But no, they killed all the guys first. Which really makes me wonder about this world, whatever happened to ladies first?As for the one who survived, yeah, pretty much figured if any of them were going to survive, it would be her. Only problem is I have no idea why she did survive. I mean, she is exactly the same as all the rest, not one thing different, so I can't for the life of me figure out why she lived. Not that I really cared except in a mildly disappointed way.But of course that leads to the reason behind the killing. I've seen some pretty bad reasons but I honestly can't think of one more stupid. It appears to be because granny ain't gettin' any. That's it. My first thought was well, maybe she should bake a few more pies then, find a hobby. Then I thought, well, it's kind of ironic, they're making a porno movie and it never occurs to the old lady to take matters into her own hands, sort to speak, maybe do it the way porn intended. I suppose in the 1970's they didn't have quite the same technical advances but they live on a farm, it can't be that hard to figure it out.Of course none was more interesting than wondering why she didn't ask if she could join in. I mean, the movie was called the Farmer's Daughters, and they already made room for the church mouse to join in, so they could have called it the Farmer's Daughters, plus one, and Granny. They were trying to make an art movie, well it don't get any more artistic than that. The great thing is it would have shown what cheap hypocrites they all were. Yes, they have one big scene where they talk about the hypocrisy of prudes and religious folk. Ok, well open minded people that they supposedly are, I would have loved to have seen old granny show up ready to get down to business, ready for her close ups. My guess is their open minds would have closed pretty darn fast, about as fast as they're knees.",2022-10-25
"""X"" follows a group of young actors and filmmakers in 1979 who rent out a guest home on an elderly couple's Texas farm to covertly shoot a smut film. However, things go awry when their hosts prove to be demented and dangerous.This feature from writer-director Ti West (who wrote and directed two solid indie horror films in the 2010s--""The House of the Devil"" and ""The Innkeepers"") is undoubtedly his most accomplished work to date. While it has all the standard machinations of your typical slasher film, the premise is unique, and the stylistic choices here are effective and inspired by the past in a way that does not feel gimmicky or cheap.While the first half burns slowly, it is peppered with a number of subtle creepy moments that foreshadow the pandemonium that is to come. The cast does a fantastic job, with Mia Goth making for a very memorable lead; the supporting performances by Brittany Snow, Martin Henderson, Scott Mescudi, and Jenna Ortega are all equally smart and nicely telegraphed. Adding to the ambiance is an eerie western-meets-choral score by folk/goth rock songstress Chelsea Wolfe to really round things out.Above all, the film is a true love letter to the works of Tobe Hooper. That it draws on Hooper's seminal ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" almost goes without saying, but it also pays homage to his lesser-known followup feature ""Eaten Alive"" in more ways than one. Themes of personal autonomy, youth, longing, and regret are neatly folded into the screenplay, serving as springboards for the central conflict that drives the carnage, while Hooper's visual influence bleeds through it all.Homage aside, what is perhaps most refreshing about ""X"" is that it uses its touchstones wisely, working the slasher formula with intelligence but not veering into self-reflexive territory. In an era where hyper self-awareness has become a diegetic mainstay in horror films, ""X"" opts to check its pretensions at the door. What is surprising is that, in doing so, it still manages to operate as a smart, slick slasher flick. Even more than that, it is simply a rollicking good time. 9/10.",2022-03-20
This isn't like Ti West's other films. It's tasteless garbage with a few good scenes scattered throughout that end up being meaningless when the film descended into complete nonsense and shock value.,2022-04-18
This movie starts off slow and never picks up. It's not a horror film so much as a boring film. If you like other peoples fats then is is a movie for you. The people act dumb. They way the people die is funny. The CGI and makeup is terrible. How can anyone rate this movie higher then a 2 is beyond me. This is one of the worst horror films ever.,2022-04-15
"The acting was ok, certainly better than the slasher films of the 90s.But the story line was deficient, no real aim and when you find out what's going on it just falls flat. There were so many plot devices available that should have been used to create the atmosphere of a horror but were used sparingly. No creative buildup with the alligators (once and done), the barns where one stood on a nail then well not much. Even the religious overtone wasn't used to amp up the feeling of impending doom. It just played out on a TV, this has been done much better.There also wasn't much for slasher fans really. The blood and gore felt like it was on a serious budget and sparingly used.A 4 because the actors were good, just badly written.",2022-04-15
I expected a lot more from this movie. It felt a lot like a reboot of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Too many similarities and the overall story is hardly believable. Disappointed as Ti West has made some good movies before. This is not one of them.,2022-03-30
"Are y'all serious?? Maybe you could be generous and say 3/10 for acting and production and that's it. Story is a 1/10, at best. I just watched the sam predictable slasher movie I've seen 1000 times before, there was nothing different that stood out in this one-besides how slow it burned til the last 40 or so minutes. What kind of a joke are the ratings/reviews including the critics reviews? I usually love A24 movies but wtf??? Don't waste your time...wtf did I really just watch?",2022-04-16
"So it's a horror movie about a bunch of people setting out to make a pornographic movie in some remote location in Texas. I'm not sure I can come up with 600 words for a film that is lackluster when it comes to porn and is just a nonsensical slasher film, but to be honest, I don't think after all the horror and/or slasher movies I've seen since the 70's on that any can really be effective anymore. Yes, it's bloody, but been there, seen that. Mia Goth does deserve some mention as she's by far the best thing in the cast in two roles, but the rest are all forgettable. I do not understand the critical reception this received. .",2022-11-26
"The movie has ample amt of tension n suspense.The gore is Fulci level but the cinematography is Bava level.Ti West deserves accolades. Terrific direction, especially the camera angles n the lighting. He succeeded in creating oodles of tension n suspense.The babes are attractive n the there's plenty of nudity n good sex scenes.One very ugly sex scene too involving old geezers.It is heavily influenced by Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Hooper's Eaten Alive, Friday the 13th, etc.The locations are haunting n so is the music.I always craved for a crocodile action scene in a horror movie n this one came as a wish fulfilled.I saw Dead 7 few months ago n it has a skull/head crushing scene via a vehicle done in a very gory way.This movie has beaten that scene.This movie will be definitely enjoyed by horror movies fans of the 70s n 80s n by fans of the New French Extremity.",2022-04-22
"This movie is utter trash. Started off great and then go weird and slow quick. How the hell is this 95 by the critics on Rotten Tomatoes. Bad acting, bad plot, bad everything. Don't waste your time and money.",2022-03-19
"Do not believe the hype around this movie, I loved most of A24 films ventures. This was a dud.Mia Goth was great, she always is, But the film itself was really uninteresting, it takes too long for any actual murders to occur, and what comes before really isn't all that interesting, I appreciate slow burn but this one was more of a slow fizzle.The gore is also super overhyped.. what movie did the others watch?A guy gets his neck stabbed repeatedly, and a girls finger is cut with a knife and then a woman's head is ran over by a wheel.. idk, wasn't that gory lol.I like Ti's other films too, so I was surprised to dislike this one so much.. but I really did.",2022-04-15
"No Spoilers.Let's be honest here. This movie was total and complete garbage.It was like they tried to take Texas Chain Saw Massacre, The Evil Dead Remake, The Visit, and throw in some porn to make this crap fest....
Boring, no plot, no character development....Half of these reviews have to be from braindead millennials and generation Z kids. I have seen thousands and thousands of horror movies; this one was in the top 10 WORST.....",2022-04-13
"They don't make em like this anymore. Good old-school slasher-horror flicks from the 70's and 80's. Writer, producer, director and editor Ti West was stellar in every department in this exceptionally well put together film. The cinematography was top shelf - all genres considered, and his directing was just as great. Even the score and soundtrack was the best I've heard in a very long time. All casting and performances were excellent, especially the lovely Jenna Ortega, and Mia Goth in her dual roles as Maxine Minx and granny Pearl. Kid Cudi also had some good fun being cast as Jackson Hole. The gore, prosthetics and special effects were on point. There were even some surprisingly unexpected jump-scares where you wouldn't expect them - all due to simplistic yet creative filmmaking techniques. The writing had a nice flow to it with continuity and decent pacing, so the 105 min runtime passed by comfortably. There really isn't much to negatively critique in this little gem, except I wished for more narrative and sub-plots. It's a must-see if you're a fan of this genre, and a well deserved 9/10 from me.",2023-01-23
"Whilst I appreciate the way this was shot which gave it a 70s grindhouse horror feels, I was bored. I can't remember the last time I checked my watch so many times throughout a movie.First hour is an incredibly slow burn of the characters shooting a porn movie, that hour isn't used for character development or anything that is important to the movie. The horror part is the final 45 minutes.Whilst there were a few good kill scenes it didn't save the movie. Paired with some lousy acting which was partly intentional giving the theme of the movie the only good performance coming from Mia Goth.With a muddled twist at the end I came out shaking my head. Not a terrible movie but not one that I'd recommend to my horror movie friends and no doubt I won't remember it in 6 months.I'm guessing the higher reviews are based on artist efforts rather than the story itself and the movie as a whole. I was looking forward to a great horror movie based on reviews but was sadly disappointed.",2022-04-19
"The movie starts well with giving seventies vibe. The concept seems innovative and interesting. Though its bit slow in begining it builds creepy feel. However, in second half it just feels like the director wants to get rid of the characters. The death of characters is stupid and incoherent. It feels as if the director just wanted to finish off the movie and go home. So a good concept but poorly executed.",2022-04-22
"No idea why this film has rave reviews? It's so boring.Nothing happens for the first hour and then the characters start getting picked off, one by one, for no reason whatsoever, in really cliché ways.The ""villains"" are laughable; some weird old couple with bad make up.The script is pretty much boredom with a bit of sex here and there.It just crawls along, telling an absolute nothing story about '70s porn actors, and then the old couple decide to start taking them all out in really stupid ways.Don't get the acclaim surrounding this flick at all?Really boring horror. Definitely don't recommend.",2022-11-18
"A fairly uninventive horror movie with predictable jump scares and run of the mill slasher movie gore/kills. It seemed like this could have been better, given the premise, had they been a bit more inventive and maybe delved into the old couple's backstory a bit more.Also, the old couple should have not been quite so old.... using older actors that could pull off the roles without a tremendous amount of really fake looking ""old person"" makeup and prosthetics (lead Mia Goth plays a dual role, also portraying the old woman in the aforementioned terrible makeup).",2022-03-23
"There was nothing new in this movie. The story was a mixture of several slasher movies and no new element was present in the story. You can't feel any intensity or any thrill in the story. There was not even a single scene where you would shout or think what's gonna happen next. The performances by the cast members were also weak due to which you can't connect with them. Overall, it was an average slasher and a wasted opportunity.Now, it's prequel Pearl has also released which I don't know why is made. No one asked for it and I don't think anyone's interested in knowing psycho's origin story.",2022-09-18
This movie takes way too long to spark at all. And I say spark for a reason. There are no good kills in this film at all. This should have been rated PG if it weren't for the sex. The old age makeup was pretty bad and I am guessing that's why those characters were shot mostly in the dark. This was a big yawn fest for me.,2022-03-26
"I was drawn to this film as it seemed like a novel horror film which I've been longing for.But really? The old woman's face looked like one of those latex masks you'd find at, I don't know, Party City, or Spirit Halloween.I was hoping for something unique regarding this rather odd old couple but really they just envied the youth and their hypersexualism.Most of this film consists of bland, subrate, partially censored adult film content and that's really all this is.I thought going in that the adult film stuff was just a front for something special, but no, that's really all this film is. Yes, the lone survivor girl (oh, how original - yes it's the girl in the poster smh) turns out to be the daughter of the religious preaching nutter on the tele -- But, may I ask, who cares??? It's just a stupid film to be blunt.",2022-04-26
This movie was weird for the sake of being weird. On top of which it was exceedingly slow. The kills were fine but anticlimactic and mostly jump scares. I love Ari Aster movies like Midsommar and Hereditary and it feels like an insult to compare them to this.,2022-03-18
"If you like naked skin, and crocodiles eating pornstars, at a farm of desolation, inhabited by grizzly and grim old knackwursts thats just awaiting death around the corner. How this herdy gerdy silky skinned b-horror movie end, i sall not tell other than blood and gore and some classic burlesque moviemaking youll get.A lowbudget horror, some scare jumps, very classic to the genre, and will for sure make some turn their face away from the screen.but not the grumpy old man,, who found much of the darkfilming too stresssfilled to handle. Therefore just a small recomment for mr and mrs average.",2022-04-14
What this movie has in blood and guts it lacks in almost every other way. The story and acting fall apart right away and as much as I wanted to hate watch it I was left so bored while I waited for the next death scene. Nothing interesting here and nothing new. Would not recommend.,2022-03-19
"It's a trope that slashers have some aspect of sex in them, sure, but the entire first hour of this pos is just the result of a horny director who wanteed to make porn but also wants to pretend they're making a legit movie to their friends. So they filmed bad porn and then tacked 40 mins of slasher on the end.A solid hour of just ""look she STILL has her tits out"" and ""let's have another group discussion about the morals of dating a porn star,"" followed by a kill scene set to the most cliched song to ever be in a kill scene.I get that there's some stupid nonsensical lookalike story going on with a girl and the old woman, but every time she moves in tense moments and a big rubber mask is bending in unnatural ways it pulls you right out of the immersion.The pacing is all over the place. Some scenes just go on for way too long for basically no additional payoff. Like yes, the killer is obviously emotional, but I got that from the first 10 stabs, and the next 20 just had me waiting for it to be over. Some scenes are way too blunt, having a person wander into an area and get killed in about 1 min flat.There's very little imagination in the kill scenes, which may have flown in the decade it's set, but we've had decades of slashers and can expect a bit more these days than someone blatantly holding a knife behind their back stabbing someone. I really hope nobody lost any sleep trying to write that scene.",2023-05-07
"As much as I enjoy horror movies and slasher flicks, then I had not heard about this 2022 movie titled ""X"" from writer and director Ti West. Needless to say that I had to sit down and watch it as I stumbled upon it. But I didn't know what I was in for here, so I had no expectations.First of all, I will say that Ti West definitely managed to put together a classic slasher horror movie, yet at the same time managing to put enough of a bizarre twist on it to make it stand out. So if you enjoy the horror genre, then you should definitely take the time to sit down and watch ""X"" if you get the opportunity.The storyline told in ""X"" was fairly straight forward, and it was very much akin to the horror movies of the 1980s. So that was definitely something that appealed to me. It was a good story, despite it being somewhat generic at times. But still, Ti West managed to thrown in enough curve balls to thrown off the audience every now and again.I wasn't familiar with the cast in the movie, but they certainly had put together a good cast ensemble. There was a good mix of talents in the movie, and it was fun to watch the people get taken out one by one as the story progressed.Visually then ""X"" was actually fairly good. Sure, this was not an over the top special effects movie, but there was enough blood and gore to keep a seasoned gorehound such as myself happy. The effects looked realistic and that served the movie quite well.The only things that bothered me about ""X"" was the obsession on showing prolonged sex scenes and such. It wasn't really necessary to further the storyline of the movie, and it just felt like it sleazed up the movie unnecessarily.I was genuinely entertained by ""X"" and it turned out to be a rather nice surprise of a movie. This is certainly a horror movie that I will recommend for fans of the 1980s slasher flicks.My rating of ""X"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",2022-04-28
"When people say it's nostalgic to 80's movies they arnt wrong.It's just like a terrible 80's movie that's focused on all the wrong things.I'm never one to complain about gore or adult situations in movies, but this movie does everything as trashy as humanly possible to the point it makes it hard to finish the movie.I would rather watch piranha 3D on repeat for the rest of my life than watch this movie one more time.",2022-04-14

"6.5/10I don't know what I'm missing, but it wasn't as terrific a film as I was hoping it would. I thought I'd be at the edge of my seat being terrified, and grasping for breath as I waited for what would happen next. Alas, it didn't. It had its moments when things got slightly creepy and I felt uncomfortable. Only a moment or two had me holding my breath until the scene ended, but I was never truly scared. More so just weirded out.The story itself wasn't great, but fit into the context for which it was set. The cinematography was half decent using shadows to hold onto tension. The score helped add onto the tension as well. The acting wasn't fulfilling and didn't give a lot of chemistry.Overall, if I could go back and skip this film I would. In the end it was just a middle of the road slasher. It wasn't cheesy, but it's definitely not the outstanding film I thought I was going to see.I hope this review helps you make a choice on this film. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!",2022-03-19

"So, I've came back from seeing this film & wasn't surprised as I sort of knew what was going to happen. I didn't see any previews so I sort of walked in blind while only knowing the name & brief story about this film.The film sees a group of adults in 1979 going off to rural Texas, Austin, 1979, to film a an adult film at a farm homestead & paying an elderly couple for them to rent out their cabin as a shooting location. But things take a dark turn as the couple seem to take a bizarre & creepy interest in what the young adults are doing.I found the film to be pretty great. It's well shot & well written. The story is creepy as with the message about jealousy & envy. The deaths are typical of any slasher of course, albeit the lake scene with the crocodile was pretty ace. It's gory as & has a great 70's/80's horror slasher feel to it which is great in itself. The eye candy is something else & there's some funny but disturbing parts also.The film did have some pacing issues though & took a while to get to the gory parts, the eye candy made up for it of course, but I did feel a lot of scenes dragged far too long than needed to be which sort of frustrated me a little. It's long for what it is at 101 minutes (1 hour 41 minutes).Overall, it's pretty neat slasher & as gory as the name suggests. It does take a while to get going, drags a lot, but the pay off in the final act is worth it.7/10.",2022-03-18
I don't understand how this movie has been rated so highly. It has zero redeeming qualities and was thoroughly unenjoyable. Spent 1hr and 49 mins waiting for it to be over. Would not recommend.,2022-04-17

"Pro tip: start the movie at about 55 minutes in and then it might be watchable. The main problem with this film is that TCM has already been made. As well as TCM 2,3, remake, prequel, reboot, and about 200 other better similar movies that the film makers obviously considered reverential. Too bad because I feel that, with the proper direction, it could have been a decent entry into the genre.",2022-04-22
"Well, I read a lot of good reviews about this film and the rating here was like 7.5 when I first checked, so I decided to watch it, expecting it would be great or at least good, but f me, it's awful. I was legitimately surprised by how bad it is, no kidding. I mean, the acting is ok, but the plot... My God. All the killing happens with no reason at all, everything is so meaningless. It actually starts well but from the middle to the end it's just bad, and I mean really bad. I don't wanna sound like I'm hating too much without reason but I genuinely don't understand how people can give it an 8 or a 9 rating.I don't remember the last time I was this misled by a rating from here. From the rating and everything that I read elsewhere I was definitely expecting something much, much better. I give a 3 just for the ""good"" start, but for me it's like a horror film for kids and teenagers that just want to see meaningless deaths, blood and gore. I'm sorry if you already saw and liked it but it's just my honest opinion, and I'm just writing this review so I can save at least one person from being misled just like I was.",2022-04-18

"I have many issues with this film, and I will be addressing them all in bulletin points.The plotThe groundwork that was laid for this film was cool, but it did nothing for anything. This movie revolves around a. Murder scenes b. Sex scenes..... that's it. If there's a story, it has not been told.The character developmentIt is so hard to care about any of these characters with the ways that they are portrayed. I would appreciate it more if it were obvious that the cast were supposed to be grey area characters. But they lack any substance of anything. We are told that the main women want to be stars. But why? Where's the motivation? I want to know why they are there and how they got there. Context can make a world of difference, and there is none. And even at the end, nothing is resolved. Is the character that Mia Goth plays still going to be a drug addict? Sure, she survived, but is she going to live beyond that?The messageThere isn't one. That's all I had to say, let's move on.The climaxOr lack thereof, I should say. Once this movie begins its murder rampage, it doesn't pause but it makes less and less sense. It gets so wrapped up in the ways that the characters have sex and get killed that it leaves no room for any suspense, any details, or character building. I still have no clue what the true climax was and when it was supposed to have started. I guess it is when Mia Goth (who I can't remember her character's name or any of the others' because they spent so little time on it) is in the main house and the rest of the cast members die. But it is so short-lived and creates no satisfaction.ClichésSo many of them. I could guess the way the characters died before it even happened.Where's the twist?I sat this whole movie through, expecting a twist. There's always one in the horror movies these days. I picked through all the details of the film, looked at every picture in their frames, and started guessing and trying to work out how it would end. And then a twist never came. They're just some old, whack-job couple I guess? Weird. Not much motivation for their ways either, other than the old lady's jealousy.-The resolution
Umm... I'm sorry, but the old man randomly having a heart attack in the hallway and dying is the LAZIEST way I have ever seen someone die in a horror/thriller. The script writers were so obsessed with the deaths and gore, but for this guy? Nahhh, that was suddenly too much. Dies silently and peacefully in the hallway of a heart attack. And wow, the old lady dying is almost as lazy. She gets blown back by firing a rifle, which cripples (?) her and she gets her head ran over by Miss Goth.-The whole stupid car keys part
The old lady steals the car keys... only for her to easily tell Mia where there are in the home (not even hidden or ON HER where they would've been the safest from being re-claimed by the group) after she realizes her husband has died. Could've just left that whole plot device out and everything would've been the same in the story. I'm going to also add that it is very flimsy storytelling that this evil old couple a. Died so easily without a fight and b. That the lady told Mia where the keys were JUST because he died. Is she suddenly no longer afraid of going to prison? Or that this girl she wants so badly will escape?TL;DR - This movie focuses so heavily on gore and sex that it loses all capability of telling a story or creating realistic characters.",2022-04-02

"Ok, just got out of the theater and here's my thoughts.The good: The acting is very good, all the actresses seemed pretty game for what they had to endure, and the men were suitably fragile with their masculinity to make them easy targets for the creepy elderly couple. The film was definitely smutty enough with lots of nudity and sexuality, of which some was a turn on and some was incredibly disgusting and made me feel sick. There was some terrific comedic moments sprinkled in here and there. The gore and kills were plentiful enough and don't hold back. Although, they are more in the last third of the film, which I'll come back to. The motive for the kills was very creepy and extremely repulsive. The 70's aesthetic was spot on. And we finally have a final girl I felt I could root for, which it's been a while for that.The bad: The film took it's time getting to the fun stuff. Very slow and unsurprising, in a very cliche way, like we've seen this set-up before in several other horror movies. It honestly didn't start sparking my attention until about the last third of the film. I was also kind of expecting some kind of monster movie with the way the film was advertised, and there is no monster to speak of. I was expecting something akin to Jeepers Creepers when it came to who the grannie is and got none of that. Just some messed up old couple who were messed up. Was definitely expecting more of a slasher than what it was, which was again messed up old people doing weird, messed up things to these kids who are making a porno on their property. Some of the editing was good at first but entirely overused, such as the flashing between scenes. Way too much of that. My final bad thing was that fact that Brittany Snow sang a song that was randomly put in the film. It felt completely out of place with the rest of the material and it dragged the pacing down even further than it already was. I'm almost positive it was the only way she was going to agree to do a nude scene for this movie.Overall: All in all, it wasn't a bad film. Although it had cliched scenes here and there, and started out at a snail's pace, the plotline was definitely something I hadn't seen before and the focus of what movie was made here was pretty clear. Even if I felt the movie was misadvertised and marketed wrong. By the end of the movie, the title started making a lot more sense. If this movie had been released at the time period it was set it, 1979, it would have been rated X and probably be on a few lists in some countries. I enjoyed it for what it was.I would recommend it if you're a fan of 70's style exploitation films or horror films. If not, you probably won't have a great time and you will definitely be repulsed by the final third of the film.",2022-03-18
The reviews here have me curious. I might download it at home later and look at the end but I couldn't sit there any longer. I kept giving it a chance and just give it a little bit more a little bit more and I finally got fed up with its weird stupid thing it was doing. Some movie just meandering all over the place and not going anywhere interesting.,2022-04-02

And now I don't know why!I also have no idea why such a well known Brittany Snow even agreed to be in this pile of garbage!The first half was so slow paced and I got bored.Every kill was predictable and has been done a million times over.Zero originality, zero character development, and zero tension.The only two good things about this movie was the popcorn and when it ended!!AVOID!!!",2022-03-26
"There are a lot of good qualities possessed by X. The cinematography, the atmospheric vibe, interesting cast, witty dialogue, and a story you can get into. Basically a modern version of Texas Chainsaw Massacre with superior moviemaking skills. However, while I DO rate this film as better than the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it still falls short. It could've been better with a better set of villains. The old couple just lacked any sense of credibility. All they served to do was gross us out with their desire to get naked all the time!!! At least Leatherface was a credible and scary villain.Still it is definitely a movie to check out.",2023-07-04
I was excited about this movie because I love horror and it had good reviews. I don't understand. I definitely turned it off a little halfway through. It's super slow and I wanted a horror movie and not a porn.,2022-04-23
"The GoodVery well shot.Surprisingly well acted.Gratuitous sex scenes.Likable characters.The BadSLOW!!! Takes too long to get to the few good scenes.No story development whatsoever.Random actions with no real explanations.Crappy resolution to the tension it develops.VERY little character empathy. I couldnt wait for bad things to happen to ALL of them.I have to admit, Im not only disappointed but actually a little angry.This film had promise. Despite the fact that the story takes 45 minutes to get interesting, the actors were surprisingly good, their characters were likable.By the times the actions starts I found myself asking, ""Oh no. Is this all there is?"" No real backstory. No explanation of character motivations.After 70 minutes of watching this frustrating waste, I found myself hoping everyone in the movie dies.The scene where Mia Goth is swimming in a lake and an alligator silently stalks her is a perfect example of what is wrong with this movie. It is a beautifully shot and tense scene where the alligator follows her as she swims to shore. When it seems that that gator is just about to chomp her, Mia gets out of the water and the scene is over.A well shot, well acted nothing burger. Not even the gore and hot sex scenes can save this one. It's a shame.",2022-04-14
"I've come to think of film production company A24 as The Asylum of art-house films. Where The Asylum focuses on producing low-budget, direct-to-video films that use film titles and scripts very similar to those of current blockbusters in order to lure customers (shouts out to Wikipedia for that beautifully succinct synopsis), A24 also produces movies that - on first glance - look very similar to generic genre films; you don't have to look very far to find the proof of that. Films like ""Hereditary,"" ""Midsommar,"" and ""It Comes At Night"" all had trailers that marketed the films as scary movies that appealed to mass audiences. Those with some semblance of familiarity of A24's track record would know that the above mentioned films would have more up their sleeve, while others may find themselves taken by surprise by how ""different"" the movies are when compared to more mainstream fare. ""X"" is no different. With a trailer that, while stylistic, advertises itself as nothing more than just another slasher, ""X"" entices customers with an accurate premise, only to pull the rug from out under them once they are seated in the theatre.What I like most about A24 is its conviction to add an insane level of quality to what should be nothing more than a disposable Saturday night watch. ""X"" advertises itself as a grimy, bloody, slasher movie - and it is - but it's one that prides itself on its high production value. ""X"" is a slasher that actually cares about its story and its characters; remarkably, it is a horror film that works just as well when it's purely being a drama. Following a crew of filmmakers who are decidedly set on making an ""artistic"" adult movie, ""X"" is intent on character-building. With all the greed, jealousy, and lustfulness that you might expect from a group of young adults who enjoy making love with each other on camera for money, I was pleasantly surprised that I started to enjoy this movie purely on its own storytelling merits, before the real horror even began.With eye-candy all around in the form of Mia Goth, Jenna Ortega, and Brittany Snow (as well as Kid Cudi, Martin Henderson, and Owen Campbell - if you're into that sort of thing), what impressed me most about ""X"" is that, not only did director Ti West pack his movie full of people who can actually act, but he also has crafted characters that are fully fleshed out and feel like real people. Unlike your typical slasher, here characters actually make smart decisions and are not just stupid for the sake of being stupid. And this works twofold by drawing viewers into the story before the horror begins, and then amplifying it once it does.With ample care being taken in character, script, plot, and production value (and not to mention the rocking soundtrack), you can only imagine how much care was also taken in the kills. Yes, Ti West will be sure to gross you out here, because there is blood, guts, and gore aplenty, and all of it wrapped around a unique visual flair and editing style that ups the entertainment value and differentiates this movie from other slashers. There is creativity here, with people dying in unpredictable and uncomfortable ways; I definitely found myself cringing at many of the deaths. So if you enjoy bloody violence, you'll definitely find a lot to like here.If I had any complaints about this movie, which I do, it's that I found the tension building to be slightly lacking. You see, I quite enjoy slashers that have long, drawn out scenes of people trying to escape their murderers (""Scream,"" for example), and this movie didn't really have that. While I understand why exactly ""X"" could not have such scenes, it did make the killings slightly lackluster - as in, character goes to place, then they swiftly get killed in said place, and end scene. While the kills themselves are creative, there is a lack of creativity in the build up to those kills. Similarly, I did find the motivation of the killer(s) to be somewhat unclear. I mean, I understand why they were doing what they were doing, but I don't really think the motivation was all that believable. Also, I found the ending to be rather abrupt and not very climactic or fulfilling. All of that said, ""X"" remained to be extremely entertaining.""X"" won't be for everyone - when the movie ended, a middle-aged man turned to his date and said, ""That was the weirdest movie I have ever seen."" A couple sat next to me, and basically sprinted out of the theatre as soon as the credits rolled. However, its almost maddening attention to quality and detail elevates it above other, similar, slasher movies, making this one very memorable horror film.",2022-03-20
"Fully hated it.Vapid characters, imbecilic dialogue, uninteresting deaths, no plot twists, no surprises, a poor man's Matthew McConaughey. Not even Mia Goth could save it. I really have no idea what A24 was thinking picking this one up. Maybe just because conceptually they knew a horror movie about porn actors would bring an audience no matter what?Honestly the only thing I liked about it was the fact that Mia Goth also played the creepy old horny woman. That was the single redeeming value of the movie. For someone so goddess-like to effectively play someone so hellish and decrepit - that's an accomplishment, but otherwise, this is an absolute garbage movie.",2023-01-16
"X: A Slasher film which is self referential in much the same as the recent Scream and Texas Chainsaw Massacre were. Like them it's leavened with a strain of dark humour. It's 1979, six people set off to make an adult movie, the producer Wayne is determined to break into the emerging home video market and make his girlfriend Maxine into a star. The director, RJ, who wants to make an avant garde porn flick is joined by his uneasy girlfriend Lorraine on sound. Bobby and Jackson are two adult film actors. Arriving at the farmhouse location they are met by a crazy old man, Howard, wielding a shotgun, this combined with an old woman, Pearl, eerily staring out a window should have sent the alarm bells ringing. Wayne sweet talks the old man with money. The old geezer is suspicious of them but thinks they're just vacationing in his guesthouse. The filming commences but soon things go awry. This is a mixture of American Gothic, Wrong Turn and Deliverance with extremely violent and downright disturbing moments. One scene in particular features Pearl, slashing away, red lit by car lights, Don't Fear The Reaper playing on the radio is masterly. Indeed the film appears to pay homage to classic slasher films rather than being a pastiche. While the violence is extreme, there seems to be an inevitability to it once Pearl meets Maxine, dreams of her own lost youth and beauty and is jealous. There are a few plot twists, the old couple in particular harbour one or two little secrets. An unintentionally entertaining Fundamentalist Preacher is ranting in the background on TV in many scenes. Mia Goth is great as both Maxine and Pearl, with emerging Scream Queen Jenna Ortega as Lorraine. Written & Directed by Ti West. 8/10.",2022-03-23
"Good acting some nice kills ,sex, boobs and nothing more. Don't see how this has a RT score of 96 it's quite long and boring .I was waiting for something big to happen nothing really just alot of blasphamy and jump scares nothing really memorable.",2022-04-30
The film started good and it is a fairly interesting story with some good characters among the bunch. I did however find the old couple a bit too unrealistic in what happens later on. It was kind of weird. But the acting was really good so it's an ok film.,2022-04-15
"The x should have another meaning, don't watch it. Just rewatch the old 80 movie horror or the texas massacre remake 2003 and 2006. They film it so blurry that you can't even concentrate on it.",2022-04-27
"In style of older classics, like Texas chainsaw, comes this 2020s modern horror. You can love it or hate it, this movie is not so popular without a reason - and you've already seen it, or at least you will.Even though I gave it the highest score, it has flaws, in terms of story in general... it's a bit underwhelming. But actors are all great, style is outstanding... horror movie lovers will enjoy it for that alone. In the last few years there aren't a lot of horror movies that deserve classic status, maybe around dozen since the beginning of 2020s. This one is among those.",2022-06-22
"When a group of pornographers head out to an old farm to film a more artsy porn movie they find themselves in a not so safe area.I throughly enjoyed this film and was impressed by how much it reminded me of classic slashers. It has a really well done slow burn where during the first half you get introduced to these characters while some getting a creepy feeling throughout. Then the second half rolls around and the horror truly begins.They did a really good job with the horror. The consistent sense of fear was really well done mainly because of the amazing cinematography at work. When the killing actually begins it has a lot of gore and some well timed jump scares. I thought it was unique how they involved the porn in the horror, I thought it was creative and something I haven't seen before.The acting across the board was great. This film had Jenna Ortega who is becoming more and more of a well known actress and she shows why in this film. Mia Goth did a great job as well along with Martin Henderson, Brittany Snow and Kid Cudi.There is one really good theme of growing old in this film and it explores how the older you become the less you can do. Having that element in a horror really enhances the film.In terms of gripes it is a horror film so you're gonna get your dumb victims it's inevitable. As well there were certain plot points that didn't make a lot of sense but I think that might just be me misunderstanding.Overall X is a creative horror film. With great performances, great cinematography, and great horror X is going to be a movie I remember.9/10.",2022-03-18
"Honestly, the least original film I have seen. We get it, you wanted to make The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but you didn't. Move along, make something new. Come up with a new idea. This isn't it. It's been done so many times. I am personally tired of it.There was nothing refreshing about this film. It was irritating. Mia Goth is annoying. I watched X before Pearl, wanting to give her another go. I don't know why I bothered.I am truly hoping her saving grace will be working with a new director, especially Brandon Cronenberg in Infinity Pool, because she needs to cut and run from Ti West as soon as possible.I hope Cronenberg brings out what is inside of her and gets rid of all that over the top acting from the Maxine and Pearl character. I think Mia Goth is more than capable of it. So fingers crossed for Infinity Pool.Back to X. Like I said, there was nothing new here. It wasn't shocking. The sex isn't explicit.. why on earth are people saying that? The gore was not even decent.",2023-01-28
"I really don't know how to rate this one, I mean I loved the retro 70's style slasher concept, but to have an elderly nympho/rapist/psycho/murdering woman as the antagonist just didn't bode well with me. Not from a theatrical standpoint but from a physical standpoint. Plus, in all honesty, all of the victims would have survived only if her husband would have given her some, she was pretty satisfied after he did. I don't know, I liked the style but the premise just didn't sit well with me.",2022-04-17

No thrills whatsoever, no kind of interesting plot device going on, no reason for this story to exist at all. Just senseless gore and murder. All of the cast gets killed, then the bad guys die too, and the ""final chick"" survives and escapes. Textbook definition of uninspired horror.",2022-04-14

Overall mediocre is the best I can give it.",2022-04-01

I kept waiting for the movie to start, if that makes sense. When are we going to get to know the plot? The characters? What is happening and why?

I enjoyed it, especially how they tied in a television show to one of the main character's arc but the 90 minutes before that were just filler.",2022-03-19
This movie was ok.I was excited to see the film but was let down by the two main villains (old ppl) wearing prosthetic make up. It completely broke the immersion for me and became un-scary and just laughable.The old ppl were so slow at killing i was wondering how they would hobble around to the next kill.

"I love Ti West. His segment in the first vhs movie, second honeymoon, is by far my favorite segment. And I love The Sacrament as well. The Sacrament is better than this movie, for sure, but this is still one of Ti Wests better offerings. ..but wait, how can we compare such a big budget film with the rest of his indie level films? Because this movie is more of a top tier indie film rather than a blockbuster. It's cool that it's A24 and that definitely suits Ti West as he returns to form, but honestly this ain't no Hereditary or Midsommar. It ain't The Witch or The Lighthouse. It's a new type of beast for A24 overall with it being I thiiink their second slasher film release?Some good things about this movie is that it has that Ti West traditional minimalist approach and if you like his work, you will dig this. Another thing that's good was the whole gator aspect of it, with creepy threats lurking below the swampy surface all the while. The actors were definitely good but it's also hard to really say they were bad considering they all didn't get as much screen time as I had hoped. Brittany Snow spoke quite a bit through out but Kid Cudis character didn't say a whole lot. Also, Owen Cambell was especially good in a role that almost mirrored Lou Taylor Puccis character in the Evil Dead remake. Yeah, kinda a rip off, but who's to say two movies can't have the same type of characters? The kills were good enough, with a few of them being pretty extreme but not in like an over the top way. It's all done in fair taste.Now, something about this movie was missing.. I saw this in the theaters and personally I prefer watching new movies like this at home but I just couldn't wait to see wests newest work. I feel like the theater screen takes away from the crispness of a quality TV screen. Also, there is a little too little that goes on here and the porn scenes are wonky. I can see where West was headed but maybe the turn out isn't as good as people would have thought it'd be. Nonetheless, I did like it. I will buy it on 4k. And I will like it more on a second viewing as per usual.Until then,
Yours truly.",2022-03-19
"Despite a good amount of gore, and some nude elders (no full frontal), X fails to shock. Every death happens so quickly no one has a chance to say ouch. It has the look of other A24 movies, bold compositions and strong colors, but behind that there's not much going on. There were gators established early on (in one of the most annoyingly A24 shots of the movie), built up some, and eventually misused in a very vanilla death scene near the end. X could have been fun if they didn't try to appear sophisticated, and took some cues from the type of film that it's about. Why in a movie about porn do we not see one (living) piece of genetalia? Seems disrespectful to me.",2022-03-18

"X caught my eye when the trailer came out. The Texas Chainsaw camera shots and vibe got me curious. Unfortunately, the film didn't live up to the trailer.I'm guessing Ti West was paying homage to Tobe Hooper as there are nods to his work--obviously Texas Chainsaw but also Eaten Alive. There's also a nod to Psycho where the movie takes a hard left halfway through. For me this is where the film goes wrong. The first hour is about the main characters making a skin flick and has more in common with Boogie Nights then anything else. The last 40+ minutes is by the numbers murder in the dark with the characters being killed off in order of importance.The problem for me is none of the component parts of the film go together. The slasher aspect doesn't mesh with the porn film aspect. There isn't a clear theme to the film. The characters aren't particularly likeable so I don't care. Maxine's storyline is poorly defined. The kills lack tension and suspense. There's lots of homage paid to so many films but at the expense of telling it's own story. At the end of the day, there's a lot going on here but none it goes together to tell a tense or entertaining film.",2023-01-04
"This movie, while better than most of the standard horror schlock being produced by Hollywood in recent years, at least is a throwback to the classic 1970s horror era. But it falls woefully short of actually being a good movie in its own right.Its filmed in a nice style, with high class camera work and does a good job recalling the era, with classic 1970s cars and an era appropriate gasoline station, and other nostalgic items present from the 1970s, but after a promising start, the rest of the film takes place in a boring remote rural house setting. This is much more a black comedy than a proper horror movie, and it has zero suspense.The actors try their best, but aren't given anything to work with, with bad dialogue, and no character development. The movie is also very slow paced, and when things do start happening, its too late, and even then, the action is pretty dull and forgettable.It gets points for being a cut above many really bad horror films lately, but it would be a much better use of one's time to actually go watch a classic 1970s horror movie instead.",2022-12-05
"""Is it possible to make a good dirty movie? "" is the question that director Ti West poses in this vintage-style backwoods slasher pic.The story focuses on a hustler from Houston, who brings his young fiancé to a remote town in the bible belt, where he plans to shoot a series of interracial porn videos featuring her, a local stripper and Vietnam vet.His plan being to make his belle a star.West filters the above question through the character of the cameraman, who seeks to shoot the raunchy films like a more classy and respectable form of cinema.This all takes place in a flashback...with the intro revealing to us, that at some point...things took a very dark and violent turn.The group rents out a dilapidated old farmhouse- built during the revolutionary war- on a strange old man's property.But doesn't really bring him up to speed on their planned activities.When it all plays out...it feels like West was going for a backwoods slasher gore film with a bit of a giallo vibe.But it lacks the mystery that a good giallo film has entirely...as it is just way too predictable.Albeit creepily so.You can tell he is going for the shock value that films like TCM and Wolf Creek possess.But despite attempts to be lurid, it comes off way too tame.Leaving you waiting for that Bruno Dumont moment at the end...which never comes to fruition.So you can't help but feel like ""ugh"".As it comes off much too fake and lame.The ""old face"" costumes certainly didn't help on this front.They should've just cast some real, creepy looking, old people instead.Cause, in the end, there's a whole lot of atmosphere, but not a whole lot else.So the high expectations they build up in the beginning just go straight out the window.Going back to the question posed near the beginning...the answer is yes...but you're going to have to ask someone like Gaspar Noe or Pasolini.Not West.Because, wheras I do like his style...this one is a bit of a fail.It could have, and should have been better.The only redeeming quality I see in it, is that West writes his relationship with Mia Goth into it (in regards to him making her into a household name as ""his"" star).That is actually pretty cool.But that's about all it has going for it, in my opinion.3.5 out of 10.",2022-10-23

"It's 1979 conservative rural Texas. A group of young people has rented a farm house to film an arthouse porn film. The farm owner does not like the young group. He and his disturbed wife form a creepy couple.Filmmaker Ti West is marrying a softcore porn flick with Texas Chainsaw horror. The porn part is a bit boring although it does arrive at a very interesting conflict. Maybe Ti should get to the conflict sooner and let that ride for awhile. I am a little surprised by goody Brittany Snow playing a sexually-forward porn actress. My brain almost refused to recognize her at first. The horror part is a lot of waiting around. The movie keeps teasing it with the Texas Chainsaw style. It's still pretty good with some great sexual creepiness. On the other hand, I do not appreciate dumb victims. I really hated Wayne wearing nothing but tighty-whities and no shoes. That's really stupid. I also hated Lorraine's last scene. I get it but that's also stupid.

"Consider the law of diminishing returns: X is the best slasher that I've seen all year, last year, the year before and probably for the rest of this year.It may also be the law of the desert island in that it may be the only slasher in years that approaches the blood-soaked heaven of 1978-1981, yet were it released then, would I feel the same way?And after seeing tweet after tweet about how debauched and filthy and sexed-up this movie was, did we see the same film? Or am I really the ""affable pervert"" that Grindhouse Releasing said I was and I've become too desensitized? Or, probably more true, has this generation become more puritanical and repressed than we were?Probably most importantly, I decided to just shut up and enjoy the movie.What I came away with was a film that actually gave me that uncomfortable and awesome feeling of ""I wonder what's next"" and a worry for each of its characters.Back in 1979, a group of young filmmakers set out to make a dirty film in rural Texas, learning nothing from another Texas-shot slasher. And when their elderly hosts discover what's happening, the cast find themselves in a way different movie.Reading that description, I felt sure that I would dislike this movie, but then again, this was Ti West, who somehow took a very basic story in The House of the Devil and made something great and lasting.I've been burned by an A24 trailer before. Come on, we all have. But again, I decided to shut up and watch the movie.And I'm glad that I did.Maxine Minx (Mia Goth, Nymphomaniac) dreams of being an adult film star and people knowing her name. This brings her to deepest, darkest New Zealand, err Texas, along with her producer/boyfriend/suitcase pimp Wayne (Martin Henderson), director RJ (Owen Campbell), his assistant/girlfriend Lorraine (Jenna Ortega, Scream) and two co-stars, Bobby-Lynne (Brittany Snow, the Perfect Pitch movies) and Jackson Hole (Kid Cudi!). As they go deeper into the rural world, we're reminded - of course - of that aforementioned Texas film, what with the van that propels them and the farmhouse they end up in.RJ has a goal. Just because it's porn doesn't mean that it can't be art, he says, almost like a non-burnt out Gary Graver. Wayne knows something more important: porno chic died because middle America is stil too afraid to go to a porno theater and still blushes when they buy a skin mag. But if they can have that movie in the safety of their home? He's ahead of the video era, Caballero and VCA before they'd even realized what was next. The themes of this movie are desire and age battling hand in hand and the fact that the new type of entertainment they're making is based on the oldest joke there is - The Farmer's Daughters - points to the intelligence of this endeavor.Meanwhile, there's Howard (Stephen Ure) and Pearl (also Mia Goth, we'll get to that shortly), the elderly couple who owns the land. Howard barks at everyone while Pearly stays in the shadows, except for the moment where she invites Maxine in for lemonade, a remembrance of youth, some jealousy and a rebuffed sexual December to May advance.That afternoon, Pearl watches Maxine and Jackson at work and begs Howard to make love to her one more time, but while the spirit and the emotional heart are willing, the flesh and the physical heart are weak.That night, Lorraine surprises everyone by asking if she can be in the film. RJ tries to use art as the reason why the script can't be changed; she defeats his argument and he watches her make love through the eye of his camera. That night, he leaves everyone behind but runs into Pearl and that's where - nearly an hour into the film - ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" plays and we're reminded of exactly what kind of movie we're in for.The end of the film surprised me. I should have seen it coming, but the repeated dialogue, the divine intervention and Greek chorus of televangelists all came together in a way that I had no idea was going to occur. Seriously, that preacher gives Estus Pirkle a run for his money.I also had no idea that Goth spent ten hours a day in makeup for the dual role, which she'll take up again in Pearl, a prequel that was shot at the same time as this movie.Even the soundtrack works, written by Tyler Bates and Chelsea Wolfe, who covers Fred Fisher's ""Oui, Oui, Marie."" What doesn't, however, is the moment where Snow and Kudi sing ""Landslide,"" as we've already established the closeness of the actors and this seems only in the movie to have them remind us they also do music.As bad as 2022's Texas Chainsaw Massacre is, this is good. It feels closer to Eaten Alive, another Hooper film, what with the alligator scene - I winced when someone claimed this movie had a scene that echoed Alligator - and I love how the final girl is the least chaste character in the movie, continually doing drugs and putting herself first.Here's to more horror being committed to only being inspired by the past instead of wallowing within it, pushing itself to new heights. I was worried if West would ever come close to House again; my fears were unnecessary.",2022-04-18
"I don't really get it. To be honest with you, I think it could have used a bit more work. I think the ""buildup"" (to which I will say there really was none) to the kills was very anticlimactic. I mean...pearl and Howard just start killin the people. And for what? Because she saw them messing around? I mean I think I would have been a bit more happier if there was some strange things going on, like personal belongings going missing, or the characters getting uneasy that they're being watched. Personally, I needed a bit more of a buildup. But other people seem to really like it and I will give it the benefit of the doubt that the gore was pretty good, but other than that I will stand by this and say it could have used more work. Take it how you will. Should you give it a shot? Sure! Because maybe you will like it, everyone is different, this is only just thoughts, definitely wasn't my movie though.",2022-03-26
"I really gave this movie a good chance. Before I spun up the DVD, from my public library, I read a number of seemingly positive user reviews. It seemed worth the time.Well it wasn't, at least not for me. First off, it felt dirty to see Brittany Snow nude. I first saw her in ""American Dreams"" 20 years ago, when she was still a teenager, and I suppose I'll always see her as a cute, innocent teenager.Second, the characters are sleazy, the story is sleazy, the cinematography is unattractive. So that just didn't leave much to like. So I admit, I didn't get through all of it, I just couldn't take it anymore. There were so many other, more pleasant, things I could do, like bang my head against the brick wall outside.The movie has a decent IMDb rating, so there must be viewers who like this sort of movie, I just can't imagine who they are.",2022-10-25
"It was just ok. I watched twice to make sure I could give it a fair review. I was shocked Brittany Snow showed her boobs, she's usually the ""good girl"".I was surprised she did it for a mediocre movie. Some of the kills were decent and pretty gory. The alligator looks so CGI I couldn't even take that scene serious.It's not the worst movie out there but it's pretty boring. I would not watch again.",2022-05-31
"LIKES:Moves:
Most of the films in A24's repertoire is not paced to my personal liking, dragged out displays of horror that try to ""elevate"" the horror genre and get you appreciating other factors. This one though does not suffer from that pace, instead just diving right into the antics and trying to get to the heart of the movie without delay. This moving pace was a nice change for me, and fits with what I believe the goal of this film was, and keeping the horror element fun and enjoyable for the most part. X will keep horror fans very entertained and may enjoy not having to ponder all the meander that is often thrown into the mix.The Laughs:
Whether it's intentional or not, X's writer and direction are indeed accomplishing some laughs in this film. The premise of the film is enough to get you chuckling, young filmmakers in the 70s hoping to make adult films, already setting grounds for humorous funs. West accomplishes this very well, his methods to filming the scenes, writing the quips, and forcing the dialogue to feel very adult like one of my favorite parts of the movie. There are other bouts of banter and error in logic making this movie very fun, and those darker comedy moments surprisingly lighten up the rest of the film, especially the justification of making good adult films that aren't just smut. Nice work there.Feels Like a Slasher Film:
The genre of slashers has been famous for years now, and A24 somehow gets the feeling right, but adds a blend of modern and traditional pain that works very well together. X's jump scares are very reminiscent of Jason and Ghost Face's antics, using cheesy timing, poor logic of characters, and conveniently placed devices and timing to issue the punishment. All of the characters feel very welcome in these types of roles, with very few having redeeming qualities to actually care about, focusing on the slasher element. It makes for a very cheesy horror that slashers have been known for, and yet there is a little essence of terror mixed into it as well.Throw in how ridiculous half of these kills occur, and again you get that element that horror guys love.The Twist:
There is one element of the movie that is a bit of a mystery device to the film and trying to connect it to the movie in some big way. Sometimes this device is merely an atmosphere device as we have seen A24 do, but surprisingly there is a nice twist to connect that tool to the current plot. While it does not blow us all away, West gets props for a double use of this device that can be difficult to accomplish.The Acting:
Horror movies seldom rock the boat of acting, often reducing the characters to very minor and selfish characters. However, this time, that direction and the actors accomplishing it are worthy of fantastic nods to what they played and portrayed in this movie. Mia Goth wins for most diversity in more ways than one, with her character Maxine having an edge and deeper side that gradually starts to rear its head by the end of the movie. She does all her roles well, and though I hated part of her character, how Goth executed those roles was awesome. Ortega has elevated herself once again for me, as she continues to rise up from her Stuck in the Middle Days. A character with a lot more extremes in her performance, she manages to take these moments to the full extent and still remain a believable and less annoying character compared to others. As for Snow, it's Zoey from Pitch Perfect getting kicked into an R rated film. Her humor and sass are indeed stereotypical of these roles, but somehow it works for me in this film, including the little songstress mode coming out as well. The guys are also noted for their skills in acting, with Kid Cudi accomplishing the balanced role of stoner and lover, with a little more depth that gets exploited. Henderson accomplishes a Matthew McConaughey imitation quite well, and is the forced ringleader that again is annoying, but works in the theme of the movie. And Campbell, well he hits the nerd role well, and I had only hoped for a little more use of that nerd ingenuity than what they did to help separate him out from the other rag tag group.The Cinematography;
A24 may be controversial on a lot of things, but I have to agree they know how to shoot a movie. X is no exception to the beautiful work of West's vision, with a very foreboding nature always following the moment of the movie. He does manage to make you feel as if you have fallen back in time to the end of the 70s and beginning of the 80s. West then takes the feeling of both horror and an adult film, blends them together, and somehow makes us feel we are actually in the lens of the camera for much of the filming process. As the horror settles in, he then goes on to evolve the presentation into something dark and foreboding, taking the mind breaking horror and fusing it with shadow and carnage that this movie is going for in the grand design. Each angle, each play of the scenery, and every close up serves a purpose to paying homage to the tropes of the slasher film, capturing the carnage in the best light possible. This may be the best part of the movie for most and is truly a nod for the creativity he brings.Dislikes:Plot Gaps:
This is more so reflecting how the story does not feel complete, with a lot of missing pieces sticking out for what A24 is known to fill. X has a lot of characters that have underlying moments and breaks that we want to explore, but the runtime and other elements overshadow those investigations. What's worse, is more so the complete background and explanation of why the characters the way they are, and how they even began to behave the way they do. Given how A24 always adds reasons behind the bizarre characters they create, you would think there would be more, but alas it remains a mystery and does not stand on its own as well. Staying after the credits may reveal the plan to rectify this, but I can't say these characters were the most in-depth creations of the studio.The Characters Are Annoying:
While not achieving Zola levels, X's cast is for the most part very annoying for a reviewer like me. Sure, this makes them perfect for the horror genre, but some of the moments are a little too much for me and a little tiring in not seeing them evolve past their shallow levels. It's again not the worst for me, but I can say I've liked other characters better over the ones we got in this installment.The Gore:
A24 is not shy to making their movies hard to watch, and this film is no different in how they paint the walls with the disturbing level of gore and blood. While again not the most disturbing element to this movie or most of their movies, X has the moments of sickening death and torture that are not my cup of tea. Not really tasteful, this film throws caution to the wind and sinks its teeth into the psychotic obsession of mauling that is not for those with weak constitutions. Some of these moments may turn your stomach, and at times felt a little unnecessary if I'm being honest. I know you are to go in expecting these things, but you always hope for a little less gore and more balance towards something bigger. Not the case my friends.Disturbing Moments That Aren't About Blood.It's A24 studios and sex, you can probably guess where I'm going with this. My least favorite thing about this film does indeed have to do with the disgusting moments that this studio loves to show us, almost as if it is a calling card for their productions. It starts with showing genitalia and uncouth sex, though at least for once it involves people, we would be okay seeing doing the act. That all changes though, as some rather gross and uncomfortable moments turn into disturbing ones that are hard to unsee, which I did not enjoy or find funny in the boundaries they crossed. Then, like all their movies, they take it one step too far, and the obsession with nudity goes into levels I don't want to see, but they rub in the face. The result is again unnecessary and disgusting stuff that adds little to the movie and something I wish they would stop, and yet they won't seek the counseling they need.The VERDICT:If you are an A24 fan, this movie is finding home in their vaults for the wickedly disturbing and unique spins on the tried-and-true series. X is a movie that gets nods for so much creative direction, fusing the worlds of 70s, horror, and porn to this homage that somehow makes things work. The acting works well to fit all these folds, and the looks of the characters helps bring the atmosphere to full light in the way they present their characters. However, it is the cinematography that is the crowning achievement with this film for me, and I enjoyed the crazy level of techniques used to capture the horror elements. However, A24 still has not achieved perfections, diving into extremes I don't enjoy bathing in that they seem to love continuing. The gore and plot holes are one thing, but it's those other disturbing actions, primarily with nudity, that are the real yuck factor for me and take away from the film rather than add. Thus, my scores for this installment are:Horror: 7.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.",2022-03-20
"I really enjoyed this, I thought I would at first, then half way through I thought I wouldn't and then some stuff happened and I changed my mind. Lots of gore, tonnes of sex (which I guess we expected?!) no twists or anything, but it was still an entertaining film.I tend to enjoy modern slashers set in the 70s/80s/90s etc purely for the lack of technology to make things easier for victims 🤣Anyway, this was on my watch list for a while and the acting was great, it was entertaining the entire way through and had some great little slashy bits all through it. Wasn't sure who was going to make it out alive, if anyone!",2022-10-01
"Ti West's throwback to seventies slashers, perhaps most notably 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)', is a wonderful slice of slow-burning horror that not only emulates its inspirations almost impeccably, but also sits alongside them as one of the most accomplished entries in its genre. 'X (2022)' is throughly entertaining, a vital and enthralling experience that has a surprising amount of depth to it. It has quite a lot to say about its genre and the usual subtextual underpinnings that accompany it, operating as a deconstruction of these elements while also indulging in them. It includes the same trappings as many of its peers, milking them for their mostly surface pleasures, but it puts its own spin on them and therefore works on a much deeper level. Its characters are surprisingly well-rounded and compelling, especially its distinct antagonist (which is probably why she got her own prequel mere months after her debut). Pearl and the protagonist, Maxine, are two sides of the same coin, the past and the future face to face. When they look at each other, they only see themselves: one sees what she used to be, the other what she may become. It isn't an accident that both are played by the excellent Mia Goth. This jealously and fear drives both of them to extremes and it's an interesting dynamic to explore. As is the sexual frustration of the villain, which acts not only as a distinct motivation but also a clever commentary on the puritanical 'sex equals death' mentality that underlies many (mostly Reagan-era) slashers. I won't delve into the themes any more than that, as they truly are surprisingly in-depth and are delightful to discover for yourself, but I will reiterate that they're arguably what makes the piece as successful as it is and are genuinely great. Of course, the film succeeds in other areas as well. Its first half is dedicated to establishing its characters and setting. Because it constantly sews the seeds of suspense, it never feels like it's simply spinning its wheels; in fact, it's genuinely enjoyable even before its inevitable carnage occurs. That carnage is brutal, gooey and visceral, alarming in its frankness and convincing in its execution. It's appropriately violent, soaked in sticky blood and tangible viscera, and it really hammers home the intensity of the fantastic final act. Because the characters are so generally compelling (and brought to life with aplomb), their deaths leave a noticeable hole in the narrative. You never cheer for them to meet their end, so the finale is far more cruel than cathartic. Still, it's undeniably full of genre joy and is fun in its own macabre way. Overall, this is a fantastic slasher that works as both a throwback and a bonafide entry in its genre. It has a strong atmosphere, some delightfully gruesome gore, a subtle sense of irony, a tight grip on theme, an interesting cast of characters, and a noticeably accomplished aesthetic. Its sly self-awareness doesn't undercut its general sincerity, so it never feels smug or so concerned with satire that it forgets to work on its own terms. It's really great.",2022-11-13
"Arriving at an isolated farmhouse, the cast and crew of an adult film begin to go about their shoot which alerts the homeowners to their sleazy goings-on and begins to take to graphic means to stop the degenerate filmmakers from doing their film and forces them to try to get away from the farm.There was quite a lot to like with this one. One of the better features here is from the solid background of everyone which gets this going rather nicely. The fine work of the cast and crew of the film, humanizing them with their own dreams and desires that range from the realistic to the full-on dreams that can be achieved at some point with work, sets them up to be a rather likable bunch. That becomes quite fun when added alongside the characterization of the older couple who are given just as much as the film crew which includes some deep touches on sexuality and passion among the elderly that borders on heart-wrenching when initially broached yet turns decidedly sinister as time goes on in the company of the film shoot seeing the enhanced sexuality displayed. This plays a major role in the film's central theme in its demented take on sexuality which proves to be quite fun. As we've already been given quite a lot of input into the wife's mindset by her constant peeping on their activities around the barn and the conversations with her husband, the idea here is firmly established regarding her long-repressed sexual desires needing to be released regardless of her age or physical composition. After seeing that living vicariously through them while they make the film doesn't work, those urges finding a release in the form of a graphic violent outburst is all the more plausible making for a vicious turn off this sexuality-filled premise. The other positive feature here is the aforementioned turn towards the violent and vicious as the third act goes completely off the rails in the best way possible. Not only is the slashing quite enjoyable as it ranges from the graphic surprise encounters that work due to no one expecting them to become confrontational to the inclusion of a crocodile living in the nearby lake that has a solid sequence, and finally working around into a full-on display of sensuality that is just as squirm-inducing as the rest of the material involving the slashing. Filled with some great gore effects and an overall slick sense of style matching the chaos of the situation rather well which makes this one of the finer genre entries overall. There isn't much to dislike here, but it does have some minor flaws. One of the biggest issues is the rather bizarre turn this takes introducing the concept of the couple holding previous victims hostage. This is brought up incredibly late in the film and seems to come about without any build-up and just dropped into the film which tends to highlight the issue of how it would've gone down without being noticed by now. As well, there's also a strange bit involving the strange decision to feature the characters so blatantly unaware of what's happening that they just ignore everything without leaving the location which is entirely unrealistic and keeps them in danger for no reason, which are the issues keeping this one down.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Full Nudity, several sex scenes, and drug use.",2023-01-15
"I was expecting more of this. The beginning was some what promising, but soon I realized how much this movie pretends to be artsy without any actual substance. Dumb main characters running around, Mia Goth being Yet Again a cheap airhead, like she mostly is in her roles. The ""villains"" aren't introduced well enough and they remain very distant. The story is cookie cutter Final Girl without any actually redeeming qualities, the main character doesn't learn anything nor is she likable. If there is supposed to be some kind of commentary on conservative religion nuts versus bohemian nrop stars, the message doesn't get through. I need to stop watching Mia Goth movies, they are rarely even decent. Well at least she doesn't pee in any one's face here.",2022-08-28
Such a great set up with great tension built for it all to be wasted. It had so so much potential as well as style but decided to go with a boring simple last half of the movie. Not the worst film but won't be watching again. Laughable ending too!!,2022-04-18

"First of all, I couldn't be a bigger fan of The Innkeepers. So, X is horror + 70's porn + Ti West. Qualified as a no-brainer at the time.There were a number of things I couldn't get past in this movie, and I'm assuming they were intentionally done. Every twist, and every kill, has a ""tell"" or a series of tells. It's a device that makes the storyline transparent, and very, very predictable (Ok, there was ONE kill that made me jump). I'm not sure why this decision was made, because it saps every ounce of tension that this movie, frankly, may or may not have had. What a baffling Metascore. Further proof critics wouldn't know a good horror movie if it split their head open with an axe.Plenty of distractions here (not the good kind). The two elderly people are clearly over makeup-ed, to, uh, cover the fact their actually young actors. Hey, the woman even resembles an actress in this film (yes, he put in a ""tell"" for that, too!). How about an intrusive pop soundtrack? God, I hate these. All the best classic horror have original scores. Oh, let's give the chick from Pitch Perfect her own little showcase, too. I mean, give me a break. He goes wide-angle crazy for the first 30 minutes solid, there's an epic crane shot (with a phony backdrop) within the first five minutes (also add pop soundtrack) -- I was assuming he was going for grimy 70's grindhouse. Mission: failed, unless that wasn't his plan at all. I also saw an unnaturally swinging digital weiner.Was The Farmer's Daughters (the porn movie they're making in this film) supposed to be inspired by the 1976 ""roughie"" of the same name? Has Ti West even seen the movie, or is this purely a coincidence? This is another real issue I had. It is these characters' ambition to make a porn film that will not only turn the business on its ear(!), but will make household names of all the cast! The movie they make inside this film is, frankly, completely insipid and boring. I can tell you flat-out there is more plot and characterization in the 1976 sleazefest. The 70's is hands-down the best, most interesting, creative decade for this stuff, and we'll never see it again. West did not even try to capture what was so great about the era. It's just a device (as well as a lurid hook, hey, he got me) for his crappy horror movie.",2022-08-12
"Someone once said 'Ti West is the best director you've never heard of."" It was me, I said that. This guy has been putting out quality horror films for years now and not getting anywhere near enough recognition. 'X' may be his best film yet. This one is a blast.This film created something very few modern horror films are able to - tension. I found myself very tense during this film. It's actually a very patient film though. The build-up is methodical and slow with only little hints as to what is to come. Because of the strong characters and dialogue though it is never dull or boring.Then when the action does kick in in the final third of the film it is a wild ride. All the pieces that have been masterfully set up fall into place and nothing is off limits. No character felt safe and I absolutely love that feeling in a horror film. The editing style ad the way it used in some of the horror sequences really caught me (and some other audience members) off guard. I had never seen anything like that in a film before, but it worked so well.There is some great chemistry amongst this cast. All six of the main leads nailed it. I have to say my jaw was hanging when I read that Mia Goth played both 'Maxine' and 'Pearl'. Are you kidding me? That is some truly incredible make-up work and acting.It sounds like we are getting a prequel to this film soon and I am here for it. If it's even half as good as this one then it will be worth the price of admission. See this one. 9/10.",2022-04-11
"You can still make a good dirty movie.The first half was a little slow, but it's pretty funny because they tried to make a cinematic porn movie, as if they considered porn stars as actors lol.The second half was where the fun began. There were a good deal of creepy moments that effectively built suspense. Ti West did a great job showing that old people again can be very unnerving.As a slasher, the kills were pretty fun, but I still wanted more gore. The premise isn't as disgusting or funny as intended.Overall, after getting past the first half, X is a fun and refreshing time. Don't forget to watch the post-credit like me. 7.5-8/10.",2022-03-19
You're a lot berate horror movies out there but this is not one of them this is another crummy horror movie that people gave a 6.9 rating to which it does not deserve it does not even deserve a 1. 9 I don't know where these reviews are coming from maybe there family or friends but this movie doesn't deserve more than one star it's garbage if you don't believe me watch it waste your time waste your money and that love tell you I told you so.,2022-04-18
"""X"" could've very easily been great if it had dared to rise above the generic slasher piece it sadly became, transcending the horror genre by at least endeavouring to convey a meaningful message through the themes / subtext of its storytelling.At first, I presumed director & writer Ti West was attempting to craft a cautionary tale which depicted how men have a privileged, selfish flippancy & are happy to exploit women for their sexual gratification but when those same individuals of the female sex empower themselves by reclaiming their own bodily autonomy (taking their personal pleasure in to consideration & making emotional advancements in absence of their partners), males perceive that sudden lack of control & equality as victimisation & thus, conflict is borne from the misogynistic entitlement indoctrinated from living within a patriarchy, since they're incapable of processing the parity they're suddenly being expected to accept... Which perchance may have credibly been a fascinating point to emphasise within the confines of this film (contrasting one type of woman's body against that of a senior in a self aware juxtaposition to question why we associate one with sex / pornography & the other, horror - acknowledging the apparent ageism / unreasonable beauty standards we subconsciously normalise around those surrounding us), but alas - that was not meant to be.Instead, it then seemed to perhaps evolve in to a commentary on the animosity between generational divides within society, portraying the bitter resentment caused by the elderly generation's wasted youth throughout history etc. Or even people's insistence on killing not only themselves with old age, but dragging the young down with them, before they go (global warming / the rise of the far right within older demographics, for instance)... All of which might've also been interesting, had the concepts been developed & fully addressed, as opposed to half baked - at most. Sadly, that wasn't done either - & therefore, although there's a lot of potential brimming beneath the surface, I feel as though most of it was left unrealised in the final product.The cinematography is great, the performances are impressive & there's a lot of personality to the style of the visual filmmaking... Yet none of that (or any of the sexual content & explicit nudity) compensates for the lack of substance, narratively justifying the more provocative creative choices being made. Consequently, you could argue it inadvertently indulges in the voyeuristic acts it ostensibly condemns & resultantly forms something rather hollow. However, catching Sam Levinson's name as a producer in the credits kind of explains everything - & I needn't elaborate any further.",2023-01-18
"Other than Mia Goth being hot as hell like every other time, this movie sucks.The story was incredibly stupid. Two elderly couples each with one foot in the grave, become jealous of a group of adult film makers. Then they go on a killing spree because the elderly man can't give his wife sex. Really? How stupid.Then there was this annoying blonde character. Every time she would speak it would be like some squeaky dog toy going off consistently, assaulting your skull. Man. It's horrible.I wanted so much for this to be good, like the old people would morph into weird creatures at night; anything would've been better than what was.If it wasn't for Mia Goth and some descent gore, I would've rated this movie a one. I rarely EVER rate a movie a one.Unoriginal and bad taste.3/5.",2022-06-05
"This movie is trash. No reason for any of the killings. All of the characters are dumber than a box of rocks. They all get overpowered by sore elderly people (somehow). It's terrible. It has one of the worst plots I've ever seen. I've never come so close to walking out of a movie, but I stayed hoping that something would reveal itself to make it not so off-putting. I mean...I love the studio, and the film maker isn't completely trash, in fact I feel like he's coming into his own as a film maker (pun intended,) but is this film needed? I feel like I've seen this story about a dozen times in the last ten or twenty years. Just to be fair, can someone help me understand what's good about it? Besides production design, acting yadda yadda, credit where it's due. The deaths in this were very predictable, and the set up to each one very lackluster. The plot and character also seems very underwhelming. It's a slasher yeah, but unlike Scream 2022, I didn't care about the characters at all. Help me understand the praise please, me and my friends thought this was a subpar horror flick. I was genuinely surprised to see all the love it's been getting.",2022-05-17
"This was a pretty fun little movie. I think my favorite thing about it is how well it established the setting, specifically rural Texas in 1979. They kept the locations limited, but that meant they were able to ensure everything looked and felt exactly right for the time and place. The story builds slowly, and feels very predictable for the first half or so, but you get some surprises once the action picks up. After watching, I read a few articles and realized there was a HUGE amount of stuff I missed, so I'm already looking forward to re-watching it. They clearly put a lot of care into this one, and I would say it is well worth seeing. A well above average effort for a low budget horror movie.",2022-03-26
"Two groups of people got this wrong: The critics and anyone that gave this a rating over 3 stars.The critics that try to play up this movies homage to the dirty and the gory flicks of the 70s and 80s are forgetting one crucial element that those films had plenty of but that this one lacks: fun. Sure, it's period. Sure, it's ""artistic"" (whatever that means). But the crafting of the story was actually kind of predictable and the dialog was lukewarm. And holy smokes, the characters were as flat as day old root beer.The gore was pretty spot on, I'll give them that.The non-critic folks that Lavished praise on this, get real- you wanted to like this movie so you decided that you did. Sure, it had some tiddies and some blood. But something about the lousy pace, the lukewarm acting and the octenogarians having post-murder sex made this movie a chore. It was literally WORK to watch.How a movie with this much sex and violence is this boring is beyond me, now that I think about it. They actually broke the formula!",2022-03-21
"X is a new horror film directed and written by Ti West, the director of The House of the Devil.The film is set in 1979 where a group of young people try to make a new and unique porn film. They have found the right place for this in Texas, namely a ranch of a parental farmer couple. The youths try to keep what they use the ranch a secret from the parents, because they know they are committing sins in their eyes. If the youngsters are caught, everything changes and the youngsters suddenly have to fight for their lives.With this film, Ti West manages to make a good retrospective film, which looks back in a playful way to the beginning slasher films such as Friday the 13th and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Apart from some twists and turns, it is unfortunately otherwise a standard slasher, trying to revive the classics. For example, the film is entertaining for slasher fans, but can also be a bit on the familiar or even predictable side.Like many slashers, the film has a slow pace, which gradually builds up over time to gory, filthy or scary scenes. For a more unique film, Ti West could have been a bit more creative, because apart from a hidden message in the film, the film is also a bit cliché. Slasher connoisseurs know in advance what is about to happen and where the film is going. As a result, they can lose interest in the film while watching.What works best in the film are the details that Ti West has used in the film. This way the place where the film takes place comes across well, because if you keep listening carefully you can hear the farming environment of the farm in the film. For example, you can hear the wind blowing through the grains or the crickets and other insects in the background. He also knows how to play nice with the camera because of the way he portrays things just to sometimes lead you as a viewer astray.The makeup effects also work well in the movie. Most of the blood and other gory things seem believable and even the parental couple who are actually played by younger actors really do come across as a bunch of elderly people thanks to their prosthetic make-up.The acting is also done well and appropriately by the film cast. Martin Henderson comes across as someone who is trying to make his own passion movie that is better than the rest of the movies that are being made. He just lacks the right insight to make this happen. Owen Campbell and Jenna Ortega try to help him as the people behind the camera, but sometimes end up in conflict with each other. Brittany Snow and Kid Cudi play the porn actors and know well the difference in the kind of acting they do compared to the official work of real actors. That way they know that their viewers won't be that interested in the story of the film, as long as they see their creations naked in the film. The best acting comes from Mia Goth, who again shows with this film that she is a daring actress, who does not try hard to make something special out of her roles. In this film she even plays a hidden double role. Jenna Ortega and Mia Goth show with this film how they grow as actresses in the film world.",2022-03-19
"Pros - few scenes were really creepy and scaryCons - where to start, story was so predictable, having old couple as villans was not believable, killing off characters one by one is so cliche, story so simple anyone could've written it, ugly old couple having sex randomly was weird, the old lady wants sex buthusband cant because heart probablems and she was beautiful when young and now ugly so she kills people very bizarre plot, two song numbers came out of nowhere and didn't work, the violence was A bit much at times and didn't seem to serve purpose, the setup was bland and uneventful . Very forgetful movie.there was background commentary with loose values and strict values along with religous undertones and that also didn't really work.",2022-10-06
"This Texas Chainsaw Massacre'ish, horror, rises above the norm of these type of slasher pics, thanks to a few smarts. While bits of it seem familiar, especially in it's starting, and where we could have had a bit more suspense, pre kill, here was an impressive horror, I enjoyed, much more than I thought I would, and will watch it again. Like TCM, this is also set in 73', where a budding adult film crew about to make their better intentioned, master porno flick, pick the absolute worst location to shoot it, where a demented old anti porn couple, have their own plans for this film troupe. There are moments and instances you don't expect, and this is what I really like, especially the crocodile tracking shot of beautiful Goth, who exudes such sex appeal in this, and owning the movie, while Kiwi, Hendersen is fantastic as her lover, and executive producer of fictional porno, a bit of a scummy, selfish pr**k. It's great, we have a lot of sex nudity, versus, a smaller extent of wholly satisfying, and in some scenes, sickening gore, cow carcass shot for one. This is an impressive horror film from an impressive director, and I would like to see more, of what this writer/director can do. Well acted horror, and it does kind of feel much character cliched, but it's the smart touches, and entertainment value I got from this. It's a very made horror, and Goth is something, indeed. Great, different, eerily effective music, score, this film can do no wrong, while offering humor too, plus the most repulsive, fornicating scene, ever put to film. .",2023-02-02
"Finally evidence that a good share of the reviews on IMDb are done by bots because there's no way this is a 6.6, either that or I felt asleep during a key point that made this get a 6.6 on IMDb? This movie is a mediocre horror/slasher that even the worst 80's slasher movie would give this a run for it's money. The acting is bad however probably intended (at least I hope), the plot is.. well there is no plot and the runtime is too long like 20 minutes too long. The only save is the cinematography in the earlier scenes that have a feel to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This is a pointless movie with little direction.",2022-10-19
"Ups his game to new level with a tight script, good soundtrack and a lot of unexpected twists and turns in this Texas Chainsaw riff. Some sly in-jokes as well, overall a welcome entry in the genre.",2022-04-16
"""X"" is a co-production between the United States and Canada that resulted in this really new 2022 English-language horror film. It runs for slightly over 100 minutes and I see this made it into the imdb top10 on the MOVIEmeter, so surely a big success and it was even higher, almost top5, the previous week. I got to watch this film on the occasion of a recurring horror event series at a local cinema and thought I'd share my thoughts with you now. Don't expect a great deal of structure. First of all, you could wonder what the title is about. It does not get any shorter than this. There is talk about one character having the so-called x-factor that separates her from the rest. Then again, if you triple the title, you will get a completely different meaning, namely ""sex"" that also fits in terms of the film's contents. I will get to that later on. The writer and director here is Ti West. He has been pretty prolific in the last 20 years with short films, full feature films and, most recently, television episodes, but this movie here has a really realistic shot at becoming his most known and most seen work so far. Maybe even his best. I see people (especially critics) liked the outcome, some even a lot, so we can be curious if he will move on to other genres in the future. Hollywood stuff. There has been a lot of focus on horror for him so far and like it happens so often with filmmakers from this genre, he also worked in many other production departments of his releases. As for the cast, the most known member you see on the photo here is Mia Goth, mostly thanks to her work with Lars von Trier and she is divorced from Shia Labeouf now, but still became a mom recently. Oh well, it is their private stuff, but I guess certain characters in this film would not like something like that too much either. Other cast members in here you may have come across in The Ring, Pitch Perfect, Need for Speed or the new Scream movie. One of them is maybe even more known as a musician than actor. Kid Cudi I mean of course.This is a film that fits the description of film on film. We have a gang of relatively young people who in the year 1979 plan on shooting an adult film inside a farm house they rented for this occasion. Of course, without telling the old owners about their intentions. The first meeting there is pretty heated already when the old man forgot who they are there and is ready to shoot the film's producer. Eventually it deescalates, but it is a bit of foreshadowing to everything that happens during one fateful night later on. That night is pretty much the violent center of the movie. Before that, a lot is implied and there is a great deal of tension, like also with the alligator that almost catches Goth's character without her realizing one bit, but not a lot of violence. We find out about the group mechanics, about the relationships the characters have with each other. I guess if you are a heterosexual male or homosexual female or just bisexual, you will certainly have a soft spot for one of the females in this film. There's a blonde who is a bit stuck-up, Goth's character, who is a self-confident brunette with big ambitions and finally the girl who is just an assistant with the microphone initially. The church mouse as she is called by another character repeatedly, but she also discovers some darkness inside her when she (not too unexpectedly) wants to act in the film as well. The brief initial conversation between church mouse and the blonde girl is also among the more comedic moments this film has to offer. I think it was ""yeah, sometimes"" what the girls replied in different contexts when being asked about their boyfriends. It sure is about the comedy here and there. Martin Henderson also gets in a solid amount. He reminded me a bit of Bradley Cooper and I mean that in the most positive way as I am not too big on Cooper. Like when he shows up only in his underwear on one occasion and tries to help another character in finding her boyfriend, it was a bit on the funny side. Also when he starts his little speech inside the barn it was funny how they made him look so experienced in life. That life was not meant to go on for much longer. What he steps on is bad enough already, but what happens later on is even worse.The guys get it way before the girls in here. You could even think that two of the girls maybe make it out alive in the end, but eventually it is just Goth's character. No surprise. She's the star. The other one with the dark hair, her actress is really, really young, was trapped in the cellar. Another horror film tradition and when she manages to almost get out, her captor is there to make sure she stays down. I found her reaction a bit exaggerated when Goth's character comes to help her, but maybe it was meant like this to depict the escalation that finally led to her death in that scene. And after all, after what she saw down there, it feels kinda justified to go full panic mode. With the adult film aspect in this film, you will also see a lot of nudity of course, some sex scenes, but it is never an adult film or so like the one they are shooting in this film. There is even a reference to another classic in terms of success they want to match with when one character mentions Debbie Does Dallas. Oh and the nerdy guy from the gang also gets in some comedy when he keeps talking about the artistic approach to his work and how he sees himself as much more than a porn crew member. A bit of a running gag. He was also if you want to call it that maybe the least superficial member from the gang. Surely a bit naive too and eventually it costs him and he is killed first. So yeah, you get to see nudity, but also West plays a bit with the audience there as if you want the young ones, you also have to sit through a sex scene between the old folks and Goth's character is right under the bed to witness it first-hand before she tries to get out. Then again, now I saw that Goth played the female there too, so a double performance. The older woman she portrays here will also get her own film apparently set back many decades in the past and West and Goth already worked on that one, so X will not stay the only film with these characters. Or of course only with the young characters, but Pearl/Goth will be back eventually.Okay, what else can be said about this one? I quite liked the farm setting, also that there are not too many characters and of course the number decreases as the film goes on. They had to get in the crocodiles as well after those did not succeed in getting their food on the first occasion. Really nice way to film it from up above, at that point still in broad sunlight. The death scenes are indeed pretty graphic with all the blood splattering. Not a film for the young ones. Bit it feels realistic, so all is good and how it should be. There is also solid depth to the characters and actually a bit of a touching story linked to the old ones, like how the old guy struggles with accepting the fact that he cannot satisfy his partner's lust anymore. Well, you see what happens when he goes for it in the end. At the same time, he develops some kind of hatred against the young people that come to his place and makes them fully responsible for enticing his wife. Take the gunpoint situation I mentioned already, but also when he is there with them and does not stare at one character because she turned him on, or at least not primarily, but because he just despises her so much. And also all the others. Early on, I thought it was just the old dame killing people, but he gets his share too pretty quickly. Oh yes, I must totally mention additional comedy moments. Most of all, the preacher you see on television. That was some really smart and interesting inclusion how he elaborates there and what he has to say exactly and how it sometimes fits the context of the film. Nicely done for sure. Also how his tape is still running when the police show up in the end. By the way, did the old lady die too then? I think she only broke her hip initially, but no clue when they got there and found them.Anyway, this Black police officer was a riot too. Already at the very start, but also at the end when he has no clue what sick events may have happened there at the farm. Or actually his very last words, the very final words of the film I am talking about: They were basically directed at the audience and this is where they created a parallel between the movie the young people were trying to make and the movie we were watching. Something really negative to say about this film? Maybe that we did not get to see Jenna Ortega during the act. Okay sorry, I know it is not an adult film. As for graphic moments, it is not just violence. Also look at cocaine (ab)use for example on two or three occasions. But nothing like that felt for the sake of it, so it is really nice. The quote that went basically like something how you should not live a life you do not deserve, but aim for something better instead was also one I liked and we heard it on a few occasions. The context or how the characters used it may have been a bit absurd, but the message behind it all is something I definitely approve of. Okay, this is it then. I am glad I watched this film and also glad that the room was pretty packed, actually so packed that they showed it a second time starting 20 minutes later for everybody who did not manage to get tickets for the initial showing. This is a film that deserves to be seen. And I think it will be, so it's all fine. Never dragged, which is good for a film as close to two hours as it is to the 90-minute mark. There is no hesitation at all for me in deciding that I give the outcome a thumbs-up here, maybe also because there are no supernatural elements, even if admittedly real greatness I also witnessed too rarely to say that this is close to a must-see. It is just a decent horror flick that will entertain you well from beginning to end I am sure.",2022-05-03
Plenty of potential and the movie was well setup but what a let down from the halfway mark!!!! Some good scenes however I walked away very disappointed especially after the trailer sucked me in.,2022-05-05
"Now, this movie didn't really have a lot going for it from the outset. Slow, predictable plot and with acting that felt awkward in how they tried to get a 70's feeling going.Jenna Ortega stands out as the least talented by far - whenever she is on screen its' as if nails going down on chalkboard - she has zero screen presence and two facial expressions. Ugh, I hope we're done with her now.Overall, a mess. Give this one a miss.",2022-04-15
"Me and other half quite enjoyed this but more due to a few good jump scares and a good solid but sooo derivative - we literally said exactly what would happen next for almost every scene.Watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre for it's biggest influence. Watch House of the Devil by the same director for a much better 70's style nostalgia horror flick. Watch Devil's Rejects for a good attempt to combine 70's sleaze with modern shock. Watch this for a bit of fun trying to capture all of the above, but don't expect anything exceeding those. .",2022-04-25
"Way stretch out movie about nothing really special but some slightly interesting characters. The setting and directing was very well done, the whole movie is incredibly polished. There is just this extraordinary humongous stretch from the start till when something actually happens.All in all though there is a very nice atmosphere and ambience throughout, the script is very well thought though, you just have to wait a lot. And wait, and wait.No matter how well made a movie is, if I am noticing the time too much then its clear that I'm not really enjoying it and that goes for X in so many ways which goes for so many horrors sadly. The good one's seem to be far and few between.",2022-10-07
"This movie is all hype and no delivery. All style and no substance. One of the most predictable movies I've seen in a while. The fact that you can see most of what is coming next from a mile a way kills any suspense, tension or scares. Poorly directed, written, cast and acted.I am not a big fan or connoisseur of horror movies, but even from my limited repertoire of those I did see, this one ranks amongst the worst. This movie had me unintentionally laughing at times when perhaps I shouldn't have to scenes that weren't meant to elicit that reaction.If you are looking for some raunchy horror movie, then look elsewhere.

Jenna Ortega is really good as the most innocent character and Kid Cudi is really impressive with lots of style and charisma.Ti West's direction is excellent with some solid use of split screen and footage from the film within the film as well as plenty of memorable suspenseful moments.

"But also one of my favorite horror movies I've seen in awhile. A24 continues to be one of my favorite studios, as most of their movies are extremely fascinating in so many ways.This one in particular, really nails the old school horror take! The trailer really hooked me a couple months ago and I always said to myself that this movie looks very interesting and it fully delivered.Although I would prefer both Hereditary and Midsommar over ""X"" that goes to say I still enjoyed the hell out of this one... even if it was more disturbing than both of Ali Aster's gems. This movie certainly is not for everyone and honestly probably not for most people; but I think it will end up being one of my favorite movies of the year. Definitely go out and see this one.",2022-03-18
"Ti West comes up with one of the campiest slashers in recent times - one that utilizes its tropes exceedingly well. I loved how he slowly built up the characters and the atmosphere in the first hour, followed by an all-out sanguinary final half-hour. West also manages to extract not one but two solid performances from Mia Goth (Maxine and Pearl) while giving the rest of the ensemble their moments to shine. Alongside the performances, two aspects of the film really stood out - the special effects and the eerie score (by Tyler Bates and Chelsea Wolfe). There will be at least a few queasy moments even for hardcore slasher fanatics, strengthened by the shot selection and fantastic intercuts.Set in 1979, when the porn industry was on the rise right beside televangelism (questioning peoples' morals), the film uses several motifs that jump-cut between a televangelist's sermon and situations of inescapable doom. There are many shots that'd stay in my mind longer than they should - blood-lit headlamps, the recoil of a shotgun, the silent presence of an alligator, the unexpected use of a pitchfork, intercourse between an elderly couple (erm!), and more. This is a gory tribute to the slasher era, which surprisingly works well because the writing is careful enough to give sufficient texture to both the protagonist and the antagonist(s). Bring on the prequel!",2022-04-16
"What a piece of trash literally. One of the worst movies I've seen this year, can't believe it has a 6.8 rating. Are you kidding me?

"A group of young people have hired a farm building on an elderly couple's Texas farm, to make a porn film. However, the barking mad couple, driven by televangelism, their belief in their rights to defend their property, coupled with an apparent hatred and jealousy of the young are keen to put the team in their place.Whilst by the end of the film you cannot point to anything particularly different here, this is well made and director Ti West knows how to spook and scare and when to unleash the gore - and there is plenty of it. The cast does well and Mia Goth is suitably enigmatic through the visceral proceedings and even if it doesn't scare you, it leaves you with doubt as to whether that holiday in rural Texas is a good idea.",2022-10-20
"I'm a huge horror fan, in particular 70/80s slasher films. After seeing the trailer, I was really interested in this movie, but it was a waste of time and a waste of $20.

"I originally watched this film as an introduction to Mia Goth's acting, which I must say is incredible this film. I was thrilled to see such a star studded cast including Jenna Ortega and Brittany Snow. That being said I think the writing did not live up to the casts potential. If you are looking for a nostalgic 70's/80's style slasher film, this might fit the bill. Motives of characters in this film left a lot to be explained and fell short in my eyes. That being said, this film serves as the introductory film to the prequel, ""Pearl"" which is far more better excecuted and ""X"" is totally worth the watch just to experience ""Pearl"" in all it's glory. Overall, his film was good but not great. However, I look forward to the character development in the partner films surrounding this plot line.",2023-06-24

"This is technically well-made movie. It's a slow burn and pretty good at that. It builds up curiosity and its murders pretty well one can enjoy it and be curious to see what comes next. Until it gets lackluster and gross.This is coming from someone who watches tons of horror and gore. That wasn't the problem. The gore is one of the movies best qualities.However the climax and the whole 3rd act isn't all that interesting and becomes a big bloody fest...... just not an enjoyable one. It is a slasher and a sexy one or so it thinks.... It turns out a bit flat in its sexiness but I guess it was good to see a proper no holds barred attempt at inhibited sex scenes that felt raw and untamed, to see some unabashed nudity and then to see all of it get chopped off!!!Its a misguided one.. a misguided attempt to make a tribute to slasher films and also to explore the relationship between sex and violence...the end result isn't all that satisfying.",2022-03-26

It is supposed to set up for a deeper story about the fame monster. Also it's a fascinating set up to Pearl and takes a fascinating look at getting older and ""past your prime"". Plus it was one hell of a ride at the end. Im honestly not a big fan of Jenna Ortega but Mia Goth steals the show as both pearl and Maxxxine. It's not perfect by any means but I don't think it deserves the hate in this comment section. There is also a lot of cool practical affects as well.",2023-04-18

"Greetings from Lithuania.Although I'm a big fan of horror movies in general I usually do not like body horror movies. Yet i enjoyed ""X"" (2022) because it tells something more. I won't spoil it but lets just say it has something to do with aging and feeling incomplete. And what separated ""X"" from lets say a mindless blood bath ""Texas Chainsaw"" series is that ""X""'s body horror is kinda justified in here - in some twisted way i did felt for killers here, i got the idea what they were missing. That is way screenplay of ""X"" goes above those brainless blood bath movies. I also liked the dirty style almost like grindhouse picture that clearly was made on purpose.Overall, given it low budget this is very well made movie because although being a body horror movie it actually kinda justifies kills or at least tells them in a bit fresh way. I liked the directing and writing and acting of this movie.",2022-04-26
"To borrow and expand on a line from Bachelor Party - ""I like my porn with more porn in it"" - and I like my horror with more horror in it.I don't think I have every watched a more over hyped film than this. When you read all of the positive reviews it does make you wonder if they are written to just boost the film up. If not, these people clearly watched a different film.Over 1/2 of the film is dedicated to establish the plot and character development. Note to director. This is in the horror genre and the plot is people making an adult film in Texas. Yep, that is all it takes.When the actual horror takes place it is so underwhelming and predictable. And for all of the time the director takes to set the plot and background to make a different type of film he falls into the same pattern of excessive blood. When the first victim gets it, he has enough blood to paint the entire front of the van.And lets get to the actual reason for the killings. A 100+ year old woman just wants to get laid. Really? No supernatural. No mysterious creatures, No grand idea. So if the husband just gives her what she wants - there is no murders and no plot??Not going to give away all of the characters but suffice to say the really bad make up will keep you guessing for about 2 seconds. I know they were shooting the prequel at the same time but next time actually hire old people to play the old people.Not going to give away the last ""shocking twist"" but wow - lazy writing. And it had 0.00 to do with the movie in any way shape or form.One part of the questionable reviews I can agree with - this movie will stay with you for days because it will continue to go through your head how bad this film was and you actually watched it. Hopefully writing this review will remove any lasting memories of watching it.",2022-10-16
"Finally, they made a tense, horror version of M. Night's The Visit.Okay, not really, but it IS one of the best Texas Chainsaw Massacre inspired movies.This movie, also like From Dusk Till Dawn, feels like two separate movies with barely any strings holding the two together. And I was fine with that. In fact, I was thoroughly invested in Movie 1 even though I knew Movie 2 could happen at any time.Three young adult couples decide the road to cinema fame in '79 is to make an adult film, but with actual flare. So, they rent out a guest house on a creepy farm to shoot it. Drama ensues and the Good Lord isn't gonna have such trash on His green Earth!So, yeah, their lives are at stake for the art of the X.I don't even know where to begin. The movie looked gorgeous and incredibly well shot. And to think, I rented the cheaper SD version. I can't even imagine how this'll look in HD or 4K. (And, I will some day because I MUST buy this film soon.)I truly loved both movies and the overall experience. It had nods to so many other horror movies while still being its own thing. Heck, it even referenced my two favorite TV shows as a kid: The Incredible Hulk and Wonder Woman. Not horror. Just a bonus.The acting was spot-on, the dialogue, sets and fashions were perfect and the movie was tense from beginning to end. In fact, it ultimately REWARDS you for being on the edge of your seat.I'm not saying...YET...this is a perfect horror movie, but it's so darn close to being perfect, I can't wait to see this again. (Possibly tomorrow since I have a 48-hour rental.)***Final Thoughts: That all said...I couldn't get past the same Live Church Feed would be broadcast on the tele 24-hours a day in 1979. Someone please correct me if that was a thing for maybe conservative, deep into Lost Texas small towns back then.",2022-06-12
"Finally, getting a chance to write about this. I love slasher films and 2022 has been an iconic year for the genre. The resurrection of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series (pathetic to say the least), the forthcoming finale to the Halloween Movie series and the 6th entry in the Scream Movies (which also features Ortega). But what stands out in this crowded genre is Ti West's fabulous X.Set in the late 70s, the film follows a crew of young filmmakers, who rent a farmhouse from an elderly couple to shoot an adult movie. But when they are caught in the act, the group is forced to run for their lives.Ti West resurrects a genre that has gone through so many changes over the past 5 decades. X plays out as an homage to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which was also set in Texas and had a group of friends being hunted by the locals. West brings his own twisted but refreshing vision to X to give us a satisfying slasher flick.Mia Goth, is stellar as Maxine, an aspiring adult film star. Joining her is Jenna Ortega as a crew member, Brittany Snow, Scott Mescudi, Martin Henderson & Owen Campbell.Ti West shot a prequel back-to-back with X. Titled Pearl, the film released in theatres a week back. There is also a sequel to X that is currently in production.X is definitely not for the faint hearted. West gets very creative with the kill scenes. But if you are a fan of slasher flicks, then X and it's prequel/upcoming sequel should be right up your alley.",2022-09-27
"I never watched the trailer to 'X' prior to watching the movie, nor have I read the synopsis. So I went in completely blind; not knowing what to expect. I had heard it was a good horror movie, and wanted to discover for myself.Assuming you share my enthusiasm for discovering new movies, I'm not going to do spoilers. This film was such a surprise that I'm going to leave it up to you to find out for yourself. What I am going to tell you, is the premise. Amateur porn film makers go to a secluded ranch - owned by a creepy old couple - to make their film. So, we have the director, camera man, the camera man's girlfriend, and the two lead actors.The film caught me by surprise by how unpredictable it was. The first act is pretty much the set-up. Some of the scenes are bound to turn you on and you might even be confused at first, thinking you've mistaken 'X' for an X-rated movie. Even the second act is pretty tame for a horror movie, but hell, that third act sure do make up for it!'X' is horror movie with substance, and I enjoyed each and every character. The cinematography is fantastic! Some scenes are so creepy it gave me goose bumps, and then there are those scenes I never saw coming that will shock you! This was disturbing on levels I haven't quite experienced in a film yet. 'X' is something you don't see every day!! This is one hell of a shocker!Would I watch it again? Yes.",2022-08-19
"In early 2022, Jenna Ortega came to my attention when she played one of the people sought by the killer in that year's installation in the ""Scream"" franchise. Later in the year, she played the title role in the miniseries ""Wednesday"".But she was in another production last year, also with a spooky element. Ti West's ""X"" depicts the production of a porno movie in rural Texas, with things starting to go awry. It's not any sort of great movie; some of the scenes are typical slasher stuff. Nonetheless, it's enjoyable, and that's what matters with these movies. I now hope to see its sequel, called ""Pearl"".In conclusion, X marks the spot!",2023-05-30
"I am very unbiased when it comes to movie reviews, and I typically try to see the good in movies, but this movie just did not connect with me. I love horror movies, but I don't know what in the world this is. The plot follows a group of porn producers and actresses trying to become stars. They rent a cabin on an old man's farmland, and they are caught in the act, resulting in violent acts. That sounds great, sounds like all the making for a good/great horror movie. The plot twist in this is ridiculous, and not in a good way. My wife and I literally looked at each other and laughed. By the end of the movie, it was the first time I have ever felt and audibly said that the movie was a waste of my time. I see everyone saying how great it was, and because of this I gave it a second view, and I can say with 100% confidence that this is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I watched Cats.",2023-03-07
"I spotted this scary movie listed at a few of the cinemas, I was intrigued by the title, I became interested because of the leading actress from A Cure for Wellness, and the plot sounded interesting, so I went for it. Basically, set in 1979, Maxine Minx (Mia Goth) is a pornographic film actress embarking on a road trip through Texas with her producer boyfriend Wayne (The Ring's Martin Henderson), fellow porn stars Bobby-Lynne (Pitch Perfect's Brittany Snow) and Jackson Hole (Scott Mescudi aka Kid Cudi), director RJ (Owen Campbell) and RJ's girlfriend Lorraine (Jenna Ortega) to shoot an adult movie for the booming video market. Bobby-Lynne and Jackson start to become romantic, Lorraine is unimpressed with the content of the film, and RJ is wanting to make it seem like a serious piece of cinema. Wayne has arranged for the group to stay at the farm of elderly couple Howard (Stephen Ure) and Pearl (Mia Goth) who have a guesthouse. Howard is temperamental towards the group and carries a shotgun while Pearl is entranced by Maxine and silently stalks her. The group intends to shoot on location, without the couple's knowledge, with a farm related theme and storyline. Filming commences with Bobby-Lynne and Jackson having sex. Meanwhile, Maxine wanders up to the couple's house, she is invited inside by Pearl who offers a drink of lemonade, they have a conversation. Pearl laments her age, expresses jealousy for Maxine's youth, and makes a sexual advance towards her. Maxine returns to the group a little shaken by Pearl's behaviour but calms down. She films her sex scene with Jackson, she and the others are unaware that Pearl is watching from outside and is aroused. Following what she has seen, Pearl pleads with Howard for them to have sex, but he refuses, reminding her that he has a weak heart. Night falls and the film crew relax in their farmhouse. Lorraine is usually prudish, having assisted filming the performers have sex, and being intrigued and turned on, she wants to shed her reputation, but RJ is upset when she asks to be in the film. Wayne says that Lorraine can make her own decisions and allows her to take part if she wants to, and eventually RJ agrees to shoot a scene between Lorraine and Jackson. But RJ becomes so furious over her unfaithfulness that he intends to drive away while the others are asleep. He is shocked by Pearl, who suddenly appears and attempts to seduce him; he is repulsed and pushes her away, so she pulls out a knife and stabs him to death. Lorraine and Wayne notice RJ is missing and go looking for him. Wayne wanders into a barn after hearing noises, and gets a nail stuck in his foot, before being stabbed in the eye through a peephole, and with a pitchfork by Pearl. Lorraine approaches the couple's house and is invited in by Howard who claims Pearl is missing. He asks Lorraine to get a flashlight in the basement, she finds it, then screams in terror seeing the rotting corpse of a missing man and trying to flee she finds the basement door has been locked. Jackson gets out of bed and Howard arrives asking him to help him find his wife. Meanwhile, Pearl enters the guesthouse and climbs into Maxine's bed naked. While searching the woodland area, Jackson finds a pond with a car submerged in the mud, then Howard appears and shoots him dead, revealing himself to be complicit in Pearl's violent tendencies. Back at the house, Lorraine finds an axe and breaks her way through the door to reach the lock, only for Howard to attack her, breaking her finger and forcing her back down. Maxine wakes and screams finding Pearl lying naked next to her. Pearl walks out the house, with Bobby-Lynne witnessing and following her to the lake. Bobby-Lynne tries to take Pearl back to the farm, but Pearl angrily insults her. Bobby-Lynne scoffs at her before being pushed into the lake where she is eaten by an alligator. Maxine sees Pearl and Howard return to the guesthouse and hides under the bed. The elderly couple talk about the murders before having sex. Maxine manages to crawl out from under the bed and runs to the crew's van, finding RJ's dead body, and the keys missing. Maxine grabs a pistol from the van's glovebox and enters the farmhouse, finding and freeing Lorraine, who angrily blames Maxine for what has happened. Lorraine panics and runs out the front door, only to be fatally shot by Howard. The elderly couple intend to frame the crew as intruders on their property and start to move the bodies. Lorraine splutters before dying, startling Howard, and causing him to have a fatal heart attack. Maxine holds Pearl at gunpoint, who begs her to help her husband, she demands the keys to the truck. She attempts to shoot Pearl only to discover that the gun is unloaded. Pearl takes Howard's shotgun and attempts to shoot Maxine, but the force from the shotgun blasts her out of the house. Pearl lies helpless on the ground with a broken hip and begs Maxine for help. Maxine refuses and she shouts insults her, until Maxine runs her over with the truck, crushing Pearl's head. Maxine is the lone survivor and drives away from the farm. The next morning, the police have arrived at the house. An evangelical programme is seen frequently playing on Pearl and Howard's television, and on the programme, it is revealed that Maxine is the daughter of a conservative Christian preacher (Simon Prast). Sheriff Dentler (James Gaylyn) is informed that a film camera (RJ's) has been found, and the officers speculate about what it contains. Also starring Geoff Dolan as Deputy, Matthew J. Saville as Officer Mitchell, and Bryony Skillington as Store Clerk. Goth is becoming something a scary movie regular, she is terrific as the lead, but also unrecognisable and highly creepy as the horny old woman, Ure is equally nasty as her hubby helping her fulfil her sick fantasies, Snow is amusing as the ditsy promiscuous porn actress, and there is good support from Ortega, Kid Cudi and Campbell. It is a simple and familiar concept, a group of young adults wind up at the wrong place at the wrong place, with a pair of psychopathic pensioners, it is obviously influenced by and pays homage to classics like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Psycho and The Shining. The sexual stuff is very reminiscent and certainly looks like something out of the 70s, while the scares mostly come from how bizarre the old characters are and the grizzly gory deaths, I'm glad it was the kind of film I was expecting, a worthwhile erotic slasher horror. Good!",2022-04-02
"We are in a phase in horror cinema where many new things are being explored, sometimes they go wrong and sometimes they go right. Fortunately, in the case of X it worked very well. The film has a very different story from other films in the genre, even down to the motivation of the antagonists. It is a film that causes a certain discomfort, along with a very great tension and it is in these moments where the film manages to shine the most. It's definitely not a movie for everyone, because of its story and the scenes of violence. But, if you watch the movie with an open mind, you might like it.",2023-02-06
"Since the response has been above and beyond that of your average slasher, I went in expecting something special. While it certainly does a lot of things well, part of it's ethos is a loving embrace of horror conventions, which though adeptly handled, are still limited by the pitfalls of the genre.Ti West made a name for himself pulling the brakes on over the top scares with a return to the pacing of classic films, and X continues in this tradition. He gives weight to the characters and extends the preamble one beat longer than you'd expect, which gives a feeling of cathartic release to the fantastically gory first kill. Due to my preconceptions about the film, I thought they had introduced the surly old man as misdirection, and was surprised and a little disappointed when they doubled down on ""creepy old people"" as the main theme. I can see how this allowed for some insightful commentary on fleeting youth and the unfortunate way society discards the elderly, but it also struck me as an odd choice to go with Mia Goth in prosthetics over an actual senior. Don't get me wrong, the makeup and acting were great and I totally didn't know it was her until afterwards, but I could definitely tell it was fake. If we're going to focus on the horrors of aging bodies, I'd like to see some aging bodies.Once the cat's out of the bag, it intentionally runs through classic slasher beats as it picks off the rest of the cast. It's formulaic but entertaining, and I did really like the one two punch of the gator bit. It's also impressively littered with little details, like subtle foreshadowing, sly meta references and mini homages to Psycho, The Shining and especially The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It all comes off a bit like some kind of gourmet hamburger, and try as they did to go the extra mile, it's still made of the same basic ingredients as the most readily available fast food.",2022-11-01
"I liked the idea of it set in the seventies and a couple of kids and a camera, and a boom, setting of in their van to a terrible old bit of a desolate countryside and almost abandoned farm buildings. Just the wonderful place to make their porn picture, oh and the two old people. It appears that they are very old and it seems that they might not notice at all as they start stripping off. The problem is that we know exactly what is going to happen. The music is great and the action inside and out but we just know what is going on, even if they don't. Unfortunately it is also very slow so we seem to be ahead all the time and as it gets towards the last half hour it seems to become rather silly. I wanted to like the film and I didn't hate it but if it had been a bit sharper it might have seemed okay.",2023-01-08
"So yeah, as everyone is saying, they felt bad watching the movie. I've the same thoughts, except, they feel sad for the characters and I feel sad because our standards have come to this that we're hailing this movie as brilliant. Imagine! LolSome young dumbs think making p0Rn...will upgrade their lives. Then the house owners of the room they rent are even dumber and go on a killing spree.That's it! That's the movie. There's nothing unique or even mysterious about this. You know what's going to happen. It doesn't even have that mystery or anxiety element.I think people who liked this movie haven't watched anything of quality for years because there's no way you'd otherwise love this movie. It's basic(er) than basic. Not even mediocre.",2023-03-03
This was a decent horror flick but it wasn't perfect or legendary. It's entertaining enough but it felt like something was missing from the film. I think it was a motive and character development. As soon as the characters started to become interesting they got killed off rather quickly. So they remained rather forgettable and disconnected from the viewer. The killers you never really learn their motive or why they do what they do. While this is an ode to 70's horror films I recall 70's horror films having some pretty good plots and story telling.It's not a bad film just one that seemed like it could have used 30 more minutes of plot/character development before getting into the heart of it.,2023-03-26
"I don't know what to say, this director really doesn't know how to write horror movies. Boring, bad effects, bad visuals, bad actors, bad directing. Like all over it is bad. It was such a waste of time honestly, and thank god I wasn't the one who paid for the movie.First 5 minutes it's ok, then 10 minutes in is normal, then i guess he got bored and said let's turn it porno, but not a lot but a little.Then like no back story of the old couple, and then let's show more skin, then let's start the blood and bad effects we have on hand. It was all over the placeI have seen 3 of his so called "" horror movies "". All of the are bad.",2022-11-02
"This is by far the best A24 film I have seen yet. First of all you have Jenna Ortega and Kid Cudi in the same movie, what the hell that is cinema worthy right there. This is by far the craziest concept for a movie I have seen in a very long time, but boy did it work. Every second of this movie was on point. I highly recommend this.",2022-04-03
"This definitely felt like an older slasher flick in both the good & bad ways. Where the kills are concerned, there were a couple that (timing-wise) caught me off guard, but none save one are anything of note.Where the bad of old slasher flicks comes in is the pacing. The first bit of it is pretty interesting & moves along well, then hits a wall after the first kill.",2022-03-20
"Unbelieveable stupid movie. Very gross and totally not reallistic, bad makeup. Don't waste your time... the high score is total trolling. Very poor scenario.",2022-04-20
"X takes a while to get to the more outwardly horror elements in its story about a group of young people in the late 1970s who shoot an adult movie at a farm owned by two mysterious elderly people, who don't react well when they find out.Right before the violence and suspense really kicks into overdrive, there's a great montage that uses Fleetwood Mac's 'Landslide' that was unexpectedly emotional, and it made me almost wish it wasn't about to turn into a full blown horror movie.I say almost because the horror stuff is still pretty good, and considering there's a ton of less than stellar horror movies out there, it's always good to see one that's well-executed, polished, and well-acted. X is all of those things, with a first half that feels more like a dramedy, and is pretty compelling while it's basing itself in that genre.It's a film of two halves, and knowingly accepts that, what with a reference or two to Psycho around the halfway point, and some general meta-commentary throughout that thankfully didn't become too frequent or overbearing. If as a result there's a good thematic reason for this divide, I may not have understood it, and if there is some deeper meaning to it, that's on me for not getting it.I also wondered why the old age makeup wasn't prticularly great, but then read some stuff about the movie afterwards that made me accept it. To explain anymore might be a spoiler.X is very good, even if I didn't quite love it. It was mostly a good watch though, and I thought of the cast, Mia Goth was really good, and it would be cool to see her in more horror movies, as she nails her part here.",2022-03-30
"X is a stylish homage, embodying 70s filmmaking with risque content, methodical pacing, and purposeful presentation. The story follows a group of pornographers who rent a cabin from a strange elderly couple. The script consistently builds tension but reserves horror for the end. Instead, the beginning focuses on characters and eerie atmosphere. Consequently, the characters are interesting. Each perspective contributes to the narrative, the dialogue is cleverly meta, and there are themes about sexual repression and the fleeting nature of beauty. These themes aren't fully realized, but still matter. Thus, the writing feels occasionally shallow but, overall, has substance.Technically, X shines. The cinematography uses film (rather than digital), extreme long shots, overheads, push-ins, and surreal lighting to heighten the mood. Abstract sound punctuates messages and emotions. Match cuts and stuttered editing emphasize connection between scenes. The music is era appropriate, including a perfect use of Don't Fear The Reaper. The naturally grungy production design sells the time period. The effects are vivid and impactful. Also, the casting of the old woman is both surprising and thematic. Ultimately, X is skillful and attempts to elevate its genre. It doesn't completely succeed but still excels as a sharp experience.Writing: 7/10

"""X"" is that type of movie that would've been a straight to video horror flick you discover when you use to be able to bulk rent videos and keep them for a week. It shares much DNA with flicks like ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and well...anything A24. In other words, cult.Director TI West gives you a very enticing premise, a group of scuzzy sex merchants want to make a porn, so they rent a (what would be now known as an AirBNB) rental home to shoot a porno. Things go awry when the strange old couple who rent the property start to infuse themselves into their shenanigans.Now, the plot itself is pretty wild and makes you ask a TON of questions...for instance, what if the couple got normal tenants? What if police were more involved in disappearances of travelers? Same questions you would ask in most horror films.So anyway, the ensemble is solid for their portrayals of 70's youth. Free spirited. A lot can be said about the commentary of youth culture and how it may aggravate some. In my case, I started to identify more with the killers at one point. They are obnoxious young'ins. However, this is how we all were when we were young.This movie will leave a bad taste in a lot of people's minds. This isn't going to be a who-dunnit. As they give away the murderer right away. It does have moments that are cringy, The killings have a gushy gore style to them. For the squeamish (again, like myself) it is uncomfortable.Kudos to Mia Goth, whom I've not seen much of. This seems to be a bridge to more adult roles. This isn't the same road as Platinum Dunes style young folk who do horror films that are really action films. The remake of ""Texas Chainsaw"" with Jessical Biel comes to mind. This has a lingering eerie quality that is more synonymous with A24.For the most part, I can imagine an audience openly ooh'ing and arg'ing at a few points. And sometimes laughing at looped dialogue. It does give you a sense of dread for the unsuspecting victims. Where it fails is sometimes...you feel that they are just cardboard characters for us to cheer at their deaths (a sickening feeling).Stick around past the end credits to see the prequel to this film called ""Pearl""",2022-03-19
"I am proud to say that A24 has put out yet another Horror classic in the making! X is a film that follows a group of youths in their prime looking for stardom through an adult film shoot in 1970s Texas. When they pay off an oblivious elderly couple in order to film using a cabin (and a barn) on their property, things aren't what they seem and their big dreams of stardom quickly become their biggest Nightmare! Every shot in this film has meaning, every character is memorable, and its overall atmosphere is eerie enough to make even the most hardcore of horror fans skin crawl. X is a film that I may be able to confidently say is the scariest horror film in 2022. While obviously I can't say this for certain until the end of the year this films sound design combined with its clearly thought out shots alone, built this tension that simply has to be experienced for one to understand what I mean! While X may not be for everyone (especially the faint hearted) if you're into disturbing straight up horror this film delivers and then some. X is an incredible film for anybody who is looking for an eerie horror film with gripping realism that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout its runtime, I know I was!",2022-03-18
"The movie is very successful in many aspects, but its biggest success is that it looks like a movie made in the 70s rather than being a movie about the 70s.A lot of people would be fooled if they marketed that movie as ""made in '79 but unreleased, now found"".And also the background is so good, I always thought of the town in Stephen King's ""Children of the Corn"".",2022-04-15
"Writer/director Ti West brings you a horror thriller set in the 1970's where a group of young filmmakers set out to make an adult film in Texas. The group shows up at an elderly couples barn and hides the fact that they are shooting an adult film. What could go wrong?With a decent cast, the trailer is pretty creepy and has a lot of potential. Unfortunately I wasn't all that impressed with the movie. It may have been mostly surrounding Mia Goth as the pseudo muse of both the fictional adult movie as well as X itself; I'm just not an all around fan of hers. Also, her playing both Maxine and Pearl was just blaaaah!X is pretty slow at getting to the good/exciting stuff and once the gore happens, it feels cheap and campy but not in a good way.This is a solid ""free"" movie. I would have probably been disappointed paying $15 to see it in theatre.Watched on the Cineplex Store (I had a free movie to use). Lucky me saw the movie move to Amazon Prime the very next day I watched it from the Cineplex Store, so that was fun 👎",2022-09-23
"From the upstanding citizens at A24 comes X, a film reminiscent of those good ole' 70s flicks in both style and structure. Ti West, who has dabbled in horror and television throughout his career, writes, directs, and produces, lending the film a personal, suspenseful touch. X is a straightforward film, with many of the classical slasher trappings, like the rural setting, gas station detour, and warped sense of puritanical morality. It boasts few surprises but is steadfast and deliciously languid enough to be engaging. The viewing experience is a counterbalance between unfulfilled mystery and gory, kinetic thrills.The film follows a group of six young adults as they make a pornographic film in the nearby boardroom of an elderly couple. Our heroes are in it for money and fame, hoping to latch onto the currently blooming industry of porn-on-video. But as day turns to night there are sinister happenings afoot and the promise of sensual delights is suddenly much less sweet.The most persistent element of the film is reverence for the style and aesthetics of 70s film. X's mode of suspense is usually pitched somewhere between breathtaking and harrowing, and features the avantgarde scene transitions of Easy Rider. I failed to understand the choice in that film, and I fail to understand it in X; there's simply no relevant information in the frequent, jumpy juxtapositions. Although X has many 70s trappings, it only passingly succeeds in evoking the independent attitude and existential dread of that era. The emulation, like most concerns beyond the gore, seems underbaked and purposeless.The film's greatest asset is its patience and gradual build of dread. West's camera roves and watches, peeking through swampy marshes and through windows to give the sense of eerie voyeurism, much like a viewer expects from the type of smut our protagonists are filming. The film has time to breathe, often opting for longer takes and an enhanced sense of place and spatial continuity. For all of the breezy porno style and action during the day, X is ultimately a film of shadows, of creeping gremlins and unseen dangers. If nothing else, it's an engaging and entertaining watch, even if the pieces don't quite add up.Although the film works moment to moment, it never fulfills greater expectations, either structurally or thematically. This is a premise which promises twists, shocks, and gob smacking revelations, but delivers on little more than suspense and gore. There's nothing under the surface, nothing to satisfyingly explain the many character quirks throughout and nothing which adds any depth or complexity to the religious pretext we're shown repeatedly. X, as a slasher, exists in a middle limbo, between hopelessly dumb films like Friday the 13th or My Bloody Valentine and the more nuanced, restrained fare of Texas Chainsaw or Halloween. X is not ""elevated horror"" but it's not shlock either. It's a respectable, entertaining slasher, but that's all it is.The script itself is weak. The dialogue is often cliched and offers little glimpse into the characters' inner lives. They each have their own quirk, but nothing to flesh them out, to generate real empathy. Motivations are lacking too. Our protagonists' reasoning is minimal, but reasonable and varied. Some want money, others fame, and one even wants to prove respectable smut is possible. It's all believable, if not hugely compelling.Our antagonists' motivations, on the other hand, are reductive and intellectually lazy. There's little reason for them to act as they do once, and the idea that this is a recurring circumstance is laughably absurd. The fear and distrust of conservatism is another element X shares with Easy Rider; the old folks in this film are reminiscent of the two yokels who slaughter Hopper and Fonda to end that film. They're actions are just as rash, and just as unlikely.The absence of any truly relatable or compelling characters makes X's overall framework as creaky as the film's civil war era boarding room. There are no greater thematic or dramatic statements to validate the ""porno meets slasher"" concept. Many of the plot elements feel disjointed and tacked on - no greater cohesion exists. There is a repeated and murkily vague commentary about religion which is never developed and amounts to little more than a final, wildly convenient shock. The film is effective and engaging enough to make you watch, but not so effective it will make you think.The more technical elements are nice individually but greater than their sum. The cinematography is crisp and stark. It's both colorful enough to evoke the 70s mood but desaturated enough to distill some intrinsic dread. When night comes shadows rule, draped across the land and lit only by an unsettlingly realistic bluish glow.The soundtrack is interesting, though as rote as the dialogue at points and sometimes overbearing, being used to drive the suspense rather than the other way around. Again, both of these elements - in addition to the set design and sound mixing - are impressive on their own, but don't mesh as a holistic vision. X is frustratingly satisfying.The cast is small and generates nice chemistry. The performances can't salvage one-note characters but they do imbue them with energy, sex appeal, and charisma. Martin Henderson, Kid Cudi, and Brittany Snow are good as the more confident and self-assured of the group, each as ambitious or laidback as the material calls for. Owen Campbell is convincing as an obsessed cinephile trying to make a point and Mia Goth is contemplative and vulnerable.Jenny Ortega (who's busy 2022 already includes releases X, Studio 666, and Scream 5) is underutilized and her character has little to do. The elderly couple play the horror broadly, speaking, moving, and doing at a belabored pace. Stephen Ure plays Howard and I don't know who plays Pearl; the actress isn't listed in the credits and I can't find the information online. Seems like an odd, rather disrespectful oversight.X would've benefited from a more explicit or exploitative approach, especially considering the era and films it attempts to emulate; the porno scenes are oddly restrained and even respectful, and the film takes itself too seriously to have a viscerally gonzo good time between the sex and slashing. The setup and daylight sequences are the most tense and taut - the actual slashing is standard stuff. In eschewing the more exploitive elements of its premise, the film also doesn't pull off the sudden shift it aims for. The hint of gory exploits to come overpowers the daylight fun and stifles our protagonists' filmmaking ambitions.Final note, nitpicky but important. The porno within the film never feels convincing for its construction or era. The lighting within is homogenous, always bright, flat, and overly clean despite a location change. At one point, the porno is shot from within a dimly lit barn, but the results are as bright, flat, and clear as when shot from the more adequately lit bedroom. The porno also cuts within itself like an already-edited sequence. Again, these may be nitpicks but they're important nitpicks. X is a film that relies on its details for immersion, and the immersion is fractured when the details aren't realized.At the end of the day, X is a diverting film. It's suspenseful and patient, two of the most important elements of a good slasher, and the setting and premise are direct but novel. It meets expectations, even if it's also an ultimately simple, straightforward film. Its attempts at deeper religious critiques fall flat, but it does stand out in the rote and uninspired filmography of ""non-renaissance"" contemporary horror. I was entertained, but that's all I was. Once the film ends, it begins to leave the memory, mixing and mashing with all of its influences and remembered more by what could've been than what was. Fans of horror, particularly slashers, will enjoy it, but if a bloody, sexy, chilling tale of lust and violence isn't for you, then I advise you to stay away.7/10.",2022-03-18
This film is not really horror. The film Old tackled age but this film just has big issues with older people. The story is about a black man and white women in an X rated film. It is also far too racial and pushes race real hard. Really quite revolting and punishes the viewer. Film excludes African American women and goes the opposite way. Very trendy and politically correct. Not one genuine moment in this agenda driven film. Poorly made. Actors misused here badly.,2022-03-30
"I have no idea how this film gets any score above 3 at most, even the 2 I have given is possibly too high, It fails on all fronts, it's not sexy or erotic and the horror is so old hat it's not even worth talking about. Take my advice give this film a miss as it is a waste of time.",2022-04-24

"Not a big fan of Ti West, so I figured this would be over praised. It really isn't- especially as it ""gets out"" to the more general public that don't have the attention span to catch everything that's going on here. Spoiler: You need to put your phone down for this one.The juxtaposition of the making of a porn film in the midst of a horror film reminds me a little of ""A Serbian Film""- which is stronger and generally much more extreme than this. We're seeing the birth of a new genre- horror/porn.This is not without it's flaws- chief among them the casting of a heavily made up young person to play an older character. You would think that after the catastrophic use of this in Suspiria 2018- we wouldn't be seeing this ever again never mind four years later. You spend three quarters of the film trying to sort out who is playing the old lady and if there's a reason for it (at least this time it actually does have meaning)-sadly, it's a distraction that's payoff isn't important enough in the end- in fact it's kind of trite. Small quibble though, this is a clever reworking that merits some serious attention as it hits a lot of right notes in a wild ride.",2022-08-11
"Firstly, if you are a horror/slasher fan you're going to enjoy this one. It's gritty, funny, gore, disturbing and pretty well executed. Secondly, the settings and cinematography are excellent.

"The plot of the movie was very interesting and innovative. The storyline was very well written, so unique and clever. The characters were very interesting and well-developed. The location of the movie was nice, just an old farmhouse. The casting was really good and the acting was amazing! Jenna Ortega, Mia Goth and Brittany Snow were the highlights of the movie, their acting was astonishing. It wasn't a very scary movie, of course there were some jumpscares (but, they weren't scary). The kills were so gory and brutal, some of them were totally unexpected. However, some death scenes were done off-screen.. The cinematography was really good, totally 70's vibes. Gladly, it wasn't like a basic 70's slasher movie. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was, that some parts of the movie weren't very well explained and some questions left unanswered. Of course, I'm sure everything is gonna be explained on ""Pearl"", the prequel film. By the way, I'm so excited about the prequel, because I really liked that movie! I have to admit, that the seX scenes were too many and very explicit (totally, expected). I mean, it was like a pornographic movie (slasher porn movie, lol). Overall, it was an unexpectedly good movie and I really liked the point of the movie.",2022-08-19
"I'll start of to say that visually the movie was very pleasing, there were quite a few beautiful shots in there. The whole movie itself felt like a piece of love making.The movie also includes a surprising story line about getting older and not being able to do ""it"" anymore with your partner and how it can make an elderly feel quite lonely. It was a surprising added depth that I didn't expect in a horror movie.However, the plot felt like it relied to much on coincidences. For some reason the group member were right where they wanted them to be each time. I also couldn't believe anyone sleeps THAT deeply and doesn't notice someone getting into bed with them and touching their skin without it waking you up. There's just no way.It was an okay watch, it wasn't what I expected from it (in a good and bad way), but I don't think I'll be watching it again.",2022-04-16
"X is not only a homage to yesteryear horror or just blood and gore galore but a slasher that genuinely cares about the genre and has something to say.It's definitely not a masterpiece and the script still plagues with some slasher clichés. However, with quite an effective scare, dreamlike atmosphere, dead-pan jokes, and characters we can pay attention to, X is an enjoyable gem that is familiar as yet fresh.",2022-04-15

"The first hour was giving me Midsommar vibes, if that was kept up for the second half then this would have been a stellar film. It lost its way, in my view, and went down the path of a stock standard horror, gore, shocker. I am still unclear what the ""hook"" was here, a few decent scares delivered though.",2022-03-26
"NO SPOLIERSFirstly, the reviews that say the first hour nothing happens, believe them and accept this if you want to watch this film.I would certainly not consider this a horror, more a drama with some gore, the plot is frankly utterly ridiculous what there is it of it, its possibly the worst ""horror"" I have seen, certainly in recent years. It centres on a group of people making a adult film in an old back house on a rural american farm owned and resided by a very elderly couple, without them knowing the reasons for renting the space.The rest of the ""plot"" is so minimal I cant really say more without spoiling so far to say that what I have described is the first hour, the last 40 minutes is the main story and it is just stupid, I don't mean that to attack the film, it really is a stupid plot, as in dumb and not believable, I sent the first hour thinking there must be a really good second half to this to warrant it, sadly no, it was one of those films that at the end I was genuinely angry I wasted my time on.If I had to give a positive, what little acting there was by the adult film crew and its stars, was ok, not bad at all and I think this is one of the films they will probably regret ever doing.Please do not watch this, I cannot comprehend how this achieved 7.1 (at the time of writing this) Its just so awful and I will avoid films by this director and company.",2022-04-14
"This movie starts out promising like an old grind house horror, but then Ti West's heavy hand soon squashes any bit of nostalgic joy out of it by forcing the movie to bow to his predetermined goal of making a prequel to it.The plot becomes a muddled mess that tosses logic out the window and not for the sake of fun or for our enjoyment, but because West was trying to do too much and looking ahead to his prequel and sequel when he should have been focusing on the movie we were watching.In movies like Texas Chainsaw, and even Friday the 13th the killer is capable and on a blood lust. But here the killer is so incapable, that without the victims basically knocking on the killer's door half-naked and saying ""hi please kill me"" everyone would have lived.And it was like the killer almost couldn't be bothered to kill. Like it was a chore. Or not even on their radar. There was no drive. No bloodlust. No nothing.There is some gore and some cringey moments, but none of it attains any new level of shock that justifies the rest of the movie's lackluster performance.I can't even say this was a case of style over substance as there is no great style on display here. Whereas in West's House of the Devil, a movie that I really enjoyed and where the aesthetics of it enhance the movie and elevate it, the same cannot be said here. X is no House of the Devil. The movie is shot very straightforward with some nods to 70's films thrown in here and there, but there is nothing immersive about the style or shots or anything that really makes you feel the vibe and pulls you in. It's just a movie that happens to be set in 1979.Overall X felt like a misfire that had the potential to be good if West had worried less about prequels and sequels for some future audience, and worried more about pleasing the current one.",2022-10-02
"I'm not sure if I'm too dumb to understand Ti West's films, but just like it happened before, I found his most recent endeavour to be another great example of style over substance.The camera work is pretty good here, the acting as well, but the writing and editing make this feel a lot longer than it actually is. As it stands, X is a very standard ""horror"" film without real scares and without any point to it. It didn't help that the elderly couple's make-up looked like it was taken from Peter Jackson's BRAINDEAD, but was meant to look realistic.More smart folks will call this a ""slow burner"", but I call it ""a bit of a snooze fest"". Better than many films out there, but not as good as it thinks it is.I read that Ti West just went ahead and shot a prequel to this, exploring the character ""Pearl"" and how she became what she is in X. Which is astonishing. How does West get the funding for his pointless films? I couldn't care less about a prequel, to be honest. Which probably says more about X than my poorly written ""review"".Watch if you're running short on genre movies to watch, but don't expect anything remorely scary or shocking.",2022-04-19
X Directed by Ti West is a horror/Suspense film set in the late 70s. A group rents a room at a secluded farm to shoot a adult movie. They rent the property from an older couple who had no idea of the intent and initially thought they were renting to only 1 person. The wife sees them shooting the film and terror ensues as she still wants to be desired (i assume she is in her 70s or 80s). The film has the feel as horror films from the seventies like Texas Chainsaw. Gets a little gruesome in the last few acts. Good cast and interesting execution of the premise of the jealousy of youth.,2022-06-04

"If you read any synopsis of this film, then you know exactly what it is about and will be absolutely prepared for the relatively generic horrors that occur.The visual flourishes of the 70s and the locations/settings seem to not-so-subtly allude to certain other Texas-based horror films, but the similarities begin and end there. Also, the entire premise of filming an amateur skin flick - a potentially controversial element that could open the door for exploring any number of challenging topics - is handled so gratuitously it makes you feel complicit as an audience member. Themes of time and aging are clumsily introduced, so much so that the movie almost seems to glorify youth while recoiling from even the notion of being a day over 30.There are no surprises here, no subversion of genre or tropes, and the motivations for what little ""horror"" does occur are so muddled that even after finishing the movie, you won't be sure what director Ti West was actually trying to say.",2022-11-12
"Ti West handles worn horror tropes with deft hands. Smooth from beginning to end. Did I mention funny as well? I liked the way he presents early 70's porn, which made fun of itself and had some artistic pretension. Everyone in the 70's talked about being truly erotic. Some few even achieved a certain level of eroticism (mostly fetish). Farmer's Daughter, an oft repeated porn title, was a good choice for this film within a film. I liked the acting by all and the photography is both predictable and striking. 'X' uses the pacing present in the genre it emulates, which to our jaded senses seems slow, but is perfect. It's plot is both predictable and new at the same time. There is a lot of talent behind this production. I recommend it for the early porn reveal and as a good slasher flick. Before watching remember, ""Gators got yur granny""",2022-03-22
"This review should all be written in honor of Mia Goth. She held the movie from its beginning and definitely an amazing actor. What might surprise you dear reader is that she played both Maxine and Pearl!The movie takes place in the late 70's, and the general atmosphere nails it with the cinematography, audio and characters script.The horror was good, not for a horror movie but for a regular one. Something that bothered me is some stupid death of characters that when watching the movie you came to realize their only purpose is to die stupidly.To sum it all, it is entertaining, and it does contain a good story. Definitely worth your time.",2022-09-28
"Wayne (Martin Henderson) is an enterprising adult film producer who, along with his stars, Maxine (Mia Goth), Bobby-Lynne (Brittany Snow), and Jackson (Kid Cudi), venture to a secluded farm house to shoot their debut movie, but when the owners catch them in the act, it becomes a living nightmare, in this sexy/bloody slasher flick, 'X'.X is a fairly cliché horror film, set in the 1970's. It seems to take a sort of 'House of 1000 Corpses' vibe, where the 20-something year old porn stars have been begrudgingly welcomed into the household of a very conservative couple. At about the halfway point in the film, the narrative shifts from breasts and sex to blood and survival. The horror aspect relies heavily on jump scares and grotesque gore.Visually, the movie is well shot, and direction seems decent. The movie is fairly predictable, so don't expect a Wes Craven-like suspense here. Overall, worth a once over.",2022-04-22
"Going into this movie, I thought it was going to be a solid movie. What hyped me more was that Sam Levinson was producing and I am a huge Euphoria fan. Everything was good in the movie...until the second half. That was when things got so over the top for me and I could not handle it. I even nearly walked out of the movie, which I have never done before. The ways these characters die is so over the top from stepping on a nail, to getting eaten by a crocodile to getting decapitated by a truck. But the worst part about this was the twist at the end. Throughout the movie, there is a televangelist playing on a small television and we learn at the end that the man girl is his daughter, and all I thought was ""WTF"". That has to be the weakest twist I have seen since Uncharted. I learned a very valuable lesson today that you can't enjoy everything a person you admire puts their name on. In other words, don't see it.",2022-03-18
"Mia Goth plays aspiring porn star Maxine, who travels to a remote Texan farmhouse with her like-minded friends to film her adult debut, The Farmer's Daughter. Goth also plays Pearl, the elderly wife of farmer Howard, who has rented one of his buildings to the group, unaware of the purpose of their visit. When Pearl spies upon the film-makers at work, sexual frustration drives the old woman to kill, with Howard joining in on the wholesale slaughter.Like every other A24 movie, Ti West's X is incredibly slow to get going, the first half of the film largely comprising of unnecessarily drawn-out scenes and self-conscious imagery-it's what cinema snobs like to call 'elevated horror' but the rest of us call boring. Thankfully, the film's porn movie plot line just about holds one's attention until the horror finally kicks in shortly after the hour mark, both Goth and Brittany Snow (as nympho blonde Bobby-Lynne) baring all for their steamy romps with stud Jackson (Kid Cudi).The latter part of the film is actually a lot of fun, director West finally delivering the violence one expects from the genre, with those who have indulged in immoral acts punished by death: there's a wonderfully gory throat slashing, eye gouging, hand smashing, and head crushing, plus a deadly encounter with a hungry 'gator. And if that doesn't disturb you, then there's always Howard and Pearl's sex scene to turn the stomach.7/10.",2022-04-21
"""X"" perhaps isn't the gritty and uncompromisingly gore slasher/exploitation-homage I hoped it would be, but nevertheless a very solid and enjoyable new horror flick, and a good return to form for writer/director Ti West. He impressively debuted with ""The Roost"" in 2005, and then continued with a handful of remarkable horror movies in a relatively short period (""The House of the Devil"", ""The Innkeepers"", ""The Sacrament""), but then surprisingly somewhat vanished for several years to do low-profile TV-work. West is now back with ""X"", which seems like a very successful move since there are already a prequel and a sequel in the making.The film starts out slow, with an overly patient and slightly too pretentious introduction of the lead characters and the setting. Everything takes place in the year 1979 (always a good excuse to avoid nowadays nuisances like social media and mobile phones), in rural Texas, where a group of aspiring filmmakers rented a farmhouse location to shoot their very own independent adult movie entitled ""The Farmer's Daughters"". They keep their work secret for the elderly couple next door, but the old folks - and particularly the wife - are not as prudish and loveable as you'd expect.The plot-twists during the second half are implausible, even borderline preposterous, but there's suspense and brutality aplenty to keep us, grindhouse/exploitation fanatics, entertained. The most pleasant surprise comes from the atypical lead characters. They seem like a bunch of annoying twenty-something jerks, but they are not. Even the most stereotypical ones (the sleazy producer, the blond bimbo, the black stud) turn out to be helpful, above-average intelligent and sympathetic people! A healthy dose of female beauty and a bit of nudity (provided by Mia Goth, Brittany Snow, and - to a lesser extent - Jenna Ortega), as well as a fitting late 70s soundtrack (including ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" and ""Bad Case of Lovin' you) also contribute to a fun viewing experience.",2022-09-19
The grossest part of this horror flick was the two actors in bad makeup playing 100 year old sexually frustrated killers. The sex scene between the two oldest living people on the planet was disgusting. The rest of the gore didn't even come close to that scene. Terrible!,2022-05-26
"This movie is a complete waste of time. Its a rip off of so many other better films and I cannot believe the rating for this movie is so high. The plot is absolutely ridiculous, the acting is atrocious, and the gore is comically bad. This is a film that wants to shock you but fails on every level save for one good gunshot scene at the very end.One of the worst movies I've seen this year.",2022-04-15
"Since the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, many films have tried to evoke the spirit of that movie from Texas Chainsaw sequels to rip-offs to movies that aren't even horror. X is the closest to capturing the spirit of Chainsaw and it does a great job for the most part.I watched the entire film without realising that Mia Goth was contributing two roles. She is great as are the rest of the cast with turns from famous faces such as Jenna Ortega, Brittany Snow & Martin Henderson (who is a real hoot as the producer).Movies like this make you pine for the prime 70s horror movies of the past but Ti West does an excellent job in how his movie feels and this stands beside House Of The Devil as a soon to be genuine horror great.",2022-03-20
"X sets out to be a thoughtful and atmospheric horror/slasher film while paying homage to Grindhouse movies such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Set in 1979. Wayne is an owner of a strip club who is producing a shoestring porn film starring his stripper girlfriend Maxine (Mia Goth) a coke addict.Wayne has rented a farm house in the Texas bible belt to make the movie.The elderly farmer Howard does not know the purpose the farm house will be used for. Along with his wife Pearl, they are fundamentalist geriatrics who regularly watch religious shows on television.The director RJ who plans to make an arthouse sex film assisted by his girlfriend Lorraine. She is religious but becomes intrigued when she sees another stripper Bobby-Lyne (Brittany Snow) having sex on camera with the black male stud Jackson Hole.It is Maxine who senses a creepy atmosphere as she wanders around the grounds of the farm. Pearl sees these young people engaging in sexualy activity and is herself aroused.Director Ti West mixes sex, religion and horror and even cheekily namechecks Psycho.It is visually atmospheric, there is a creepy atmosphere and plenty of gore when it eventually arrives. Maybe a warning should have been given about the scenes of old people having sex though.Unusually for these type of low budget slasher films, it is very well acted. I guessed Pearl was played by a much younger actress.It does start out very slowly, the scene setting takes too long. It also could had done without the opening scene that led to the flashback. There was no need to inform the audience what bloodshed took place beforehand.",2022-05-10

"X is a slow burn horror in the best possible way. The tension is amped up. The scene is set. All the pieces are put in place perfectly, leading to a thrilling and wild final act.The setting lends itself perfectly to a tense and unnerving tone, which is executed so well.Visually this film is terrific. It manages to cultivate a retro feel through grainy imagery, and has impressive camera work.The performances are all very solid. Its a cast of only 8 people for the most part, and they all do a fantastic job.Furthermore X never relies heavily on horror cliches. On the surface the story might not seem overly original, but when you dig deeper there's lots of brilliant and unique stuff to explore.A brilliant horror which really surprised me with its quality.",2022-04-02

Then it's nothing but horny old people which has been done time and time again. The shining, hereditary, It Follows, etc all have nude old people. That isn't scary. It's just over used and Tiring and gross.On the one hand I get the ""theme"" this movie is trying to tell. On the other, it is just so painfully slow and boring that I had to legit pause it, go to sleep, then finish it when I woke up. Do yourself a favor and skip on this. It isn't scary or funny or original. It's just a waste of roughly 2 hours.",2023-03-06
"'X' sets up all the promise of a fun, black comedy / exploitation horror that is mostly entertaining, but sabotages itself with predictable slasher tropes, hammy makeup and downright stupid plot moments.The premise is silly, but you roll with it: a bunch of amateur pornographers rent a cabin on a farm owned by an elderly couple, where they plan to shoot the film that will kickstart their careers. But we soon find out that the elderly couple have some disturbing kinks of their own...The first 50 minutes is a stylish homage to Tobe Hooper's ' The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', with some cool shots and editing tricks that harken back to the films of old and give everything a glossy, dreamy vibe. The tension is cranked meticulously throughout, and we know that despite all the tits and giggles, some shit is about to go down.I was having fun up until the first kill scene, which is so over the top and implausible, I almost laughed. And then it just gets stupider from there. I didn't know whether I was supposed to be laughing or flinching, but the 'scary' moments just came off as lame and ridiculous.It doesn't help that the old couple are clearly two younger actors in prosthetic makeup. There are some disturbing, gross out scenes I'll say, but nothing that made me jump, which is kind of what I expected from a film like this. The final denouement is laugh out loud funny, but again I'm not sure if it was intentional or just another dumb plot point.I gave up caring and just rode the rollercoaster to the end, but I wouldn't watch it again.",2022-04-24

At least use actual older actors instead of using tones of makeup to make the actors look like cancer patients and then hey, let's throw in a geezer cancer patient sex scene to make the movie even more stupid (did the writers actually think that was going to be a cool scene that would add any sort of value to the movie?).It's pretty boring watching the horny old lady kill people (yes I said horny), sure it may sound original but it doesn't work at all. The main actors were a good selection and had promise with a better script. I had high expectations as you always hope a good horror movie comes along but this ain't it, and how does this crap get made?",2022-04-16

"In Houston, Texas 1979, up and coming porn actress Maxine Minx (Mia Goth), a long with fellow actors Bobby-Lynne (Brittany Snow), Jackson Hole (Scott Mescuid), Maxine's produer boyfriend Wayne (Martin Henderson), director/cameraman RJ (Owen Campbell) and his girlfriend/sound engineer Lorraine (Jenna Ortega) embark on a road trip to rural Texas to shoot pornographic film ""The Farmer's Daughters"". Their trip takes them to a dilapidated farm owned by elderly couple Howard (Stephen Ure) and his aloof and enigmatic wife, Pearl (Mia Goth). However as time goes on the group soon find themselves terrorized and fighting for their lives.X marks the latest film from horror director TI West who's made a name for himself with solidly received films such as The House of the Devil and The Sacrament as well as segments in anthologies such as V/H/S and The ABCs of Death. West has a very gritty style evocative of the 70s era of grungy almost grindhouse type of horror films, but unlike some filmmakers who utilize that style West usually plays it very straight without winking at the camera such as when Quentin Tarantino or Robert Rodriguez indulge in that style of filmmaking. Much like how House of the Devil tackled the stylings of Satanic Horror films of the 70s and The Sacrament was West's own take on Jonestown despite being contemporary, X sees west once again return to the 70s paying homage both the Golden Age of Pornography as well as the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I'm going to say right off the bat that I LOVED X and if you're either a fan of West or love slasher horror with a healthy seasoning of twisted humor then this is the movie for you.Unlike a lot of slasher movies where the characters are often loud mouthed obnoxious stereotypes designed to make you hate them (looking at you Texas Chainsaw Massacre '22), X takes the time and effort to establish its characters and make you care about them over the course of its 100 minute runtime. The movie creates some memorable characters with Jackson's laid back 'Nam vet turned porn lead who exudes relaxed masculine charisma, Bobby-Lynne's uninhibited zest and enthusiasm, or demure ingenue Lorraine and all the characters have their own appeal and even when they aren't likable such as RJ they remain interesting. The movie takes a slow burn approach to its slasher formula with the first 50 minutes used to build a group dynamic whilst also establishing the atmosphere of this isolated farm. It's welcome to see a slasher that cares about its characters and giving them distinct identities and honestly the characters are interesting enough they alone could sustain this movie even without the horror elements.The elderly couple of Howard and Pearl are truly memorable and Mia Goth is clearly having fun in a dual role that required her to go through 10 hours of prosthetic and make up work to create Pearl. Once the movie brings the slasher elements, it does so with gusto with West bringing his typical high quality and disturbing gore-work whilst also bringing in some strange surreal moments that bring in some dark humor in a manner similar to how Tobe Hooper did in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. One sequence, a sex scene, is definitely this movie's equivalent of the ""Dinner Table scene"" from Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and like that scene it balances disturbing with darkly comic to create an engaging and memorable set piece.I really loved X and if you love horror or slasher films you'll definitely want to check this out. The movie does take its time before getting to the slasher elements, but it does so with purpose so it can build memorable characters, palpable atmosphere, and threatening monsters.",2022-04-17
"What a mess this film is. It's too bad because it has that throw back campy slasher vibe, but it soon unravels into something that will make you want to gouge your own eyes out. Be prepared to gag and cover your eyes but not because of the scares and gore, but because what turns from young people shooting a porn shifts to old people wanting to be a part of it or the stars of it or just, the person who wrote this just wanted to have everyone bang. Just yikes. Feel bad for Brittney Snow, she seems like she should get better roles than this. The story about the cult on the TV doesn't really wrap up. It's not funny enough be campy. It's not scary enough to be a slasher. Not enjoyable at all. Change the name to XC because the 90 year old geriatrics banging should come with a warning.",2022-06-08
"The innocent last survivor girl is non exsistant in ""X."" Which is basically the original Texas chainsaw massacre but with characters filming a Porno instead of just randomly passing through.It's suscessful at being more than that though, by tapping into fears we probably all have about age, and by playing about with our expectations. Though it does take a bit long to get to the point.It's an arty film with lots of cool camera angles and everything. But is more disturbing than truly scary.",2022-03-31
"X (2022) follows a group of adult filmmakers who go to shoot in rural Texas, however when the owners of where they are staying catch them in the act, things get deadlier than expected. I really enjoyed this film! It was tense and scary, with a lot of build up and a satisfying climax that answered a lot of questions!The score was eerie and off-putting, with some very effective sound design to go alongside it! Also, the soundtrack itself was iconic! I absolutely adore when a film can really set the mood purely from the audio!The cinematography was a big stand out, and it was all very reminiscent of Psycho (1960), and just 60s/70s horror in general. I loved some of the zooms, which resulted in a lot of creepy window shots! There were great parallels between certain shots and a lot of artistic cuts which made the film feel unique from other slashers. Also, the parts with the 'adult film' looked super realistic and I loved the colour palettes.To go with this, the visual and practical effects were amazing! The gore looked realistic, and the first kill was so brutal and unexpected which I loved! The make-up team really out-did themselves and it's crazy that Mia goth also played Pearl! I thought that was amazing! The make up looked brilliant and I really couldn't tell. Mia Goth's make up as Maxine was great too, and very 70s accurate, so was all the costuming!All the characters were great in their own ways and had distinct personalities, I particularly loved Lorraine's character! This was all helped by strangely funny dialogue, that was consistently engaging.Lastly, the movie is very entertaining all throughout and has a consistent sense of dread which creates mystery and an unnerving atmosphere. The film doesn't take itself too seriously, but actually has a lot to it and was very tense!",2022-07-29
"I'm so glad I watched Pearl first - my fav movie of the year so far, because after X I'm not sure I would have wanted to. It doesn't quite add up with Perl's much more complex character/story, and we learn very little about Maxine. Still, I loved some particular scenes like the one where old Pearl dresses up and tries to get her husband to bed or the one where we see the youngest wanna be star in her girl's panties saying ""Sunday"". Maxine floating in the alligator's pond like she herself is a vicious reptile is priceless. It's not enough for a movie though. Still, Maxine definitely stays on my list.",2023-06-21
"A pseudo-slasher with a confused style, dull kills, and one of the most pitiful concepts in horror history. Writer/director Ti West clearly knows the recipe for vomit, but X is all filth and no fun. What a dirty shame.Grade: D-",2022-06-08
"X is a simple, yet effective horror movie that takes a demented twist on vintage pornography. The film is centered around a group of adult filmmakers, as they spend the night at an elderly couple's cottage. The horror-thriller stars Mia Goth as Maxine/Pearl, Jenny Ortega as Lorraine, Brittany Snow as Bobby-Lynne, Kid Cudi as Jackson, Stephen Ure as Howard, Martin Henderson as Wayne, and Owen Campbell as RJ. This is the first film in TI West's ""X"" Trilogy and it serves as a sinful love letter to the slasher films of the 70s.The story is straightforward, well-paced, and engaging. The horror/slasher genre has explored many settings and themes. Everso often the genre punishes the characters for violating the ""rules"" of the game via immorality. X is no different, however the concept of morality is explored from the frame of ""immorality"" is moralitly. The protagonists and antagonists are each victims of their own desires. Sex is effectively juxtaposed to religion. The film pits both concepts at odds. As the first film in the trilogy, X presents each character in a manner that entices the viewer to want more. Depth is well-applied to each character through dialogue and nonverbal expressions. Plot points are foreshadowed with effective pay-offs. At times the simplicity hurts the film. There's not much to the story outside of what is presented. In an era of psychological horror-thrillers, this film finds itself being fairly undemanding. It's not much of a ""scary"" movie. However, despite the film not being ""scary,"" the tension building is enticing.The cast has great chemistry. Mia Goth's portrayal of both Maxine and Pearl are distinct. Each character shares motivation, however each are different. Maxine is relatively harmless and bright eyed, where as Pearl is cynical and seasoned. Each character has a different twang to their southern accents. Goth makes each character unique and special in their own rights. Brittany Snow stands out as Bobby-Lynne. Snow's delivery of a porn starlet is outlandish for her filmography, however she fits perfectly in the role. Bobby-Lynne is the base for the sexuality that the film exhumes. Kid Cudi's portrayal of Jackson is solid. Jackson is a warm character, yet masculine character that adds an air of ease to the cast. Stephen Ure, Jenny Ortega, Martin Henderson, and Owen Campbell are all good in their roles. Each character interaction is natural. The film's charm is predicated on the cast's chemistry. Whereas most slasher film throws random personalities together, X throws like-minded parties into the bog and comes out clean.The cinematography is a throw-back to 70s films. The camera zooms and encloses into characters from a wide shot, delivering a vintage experience. At times, the film mimics that of 70s pornography taking a 4:3 aspect ratio, providing an air of authenticity. Lighting is used effectively. The film is very dark at times, adding to the overall tension. The use of the color red enhances the deaths, as well as the gore within the film. Largely, the film is well-edited. Moments of tension are matched with sex scenes in a manner that successfully juxtaposes the scenes while telling one cohesive story.Overall, X is a simple, yet enjoyable slasher flick. It effectively pays homage to classic slasher thrillers, while placing its own stamp on the genre. The film is bolstered by the cast's chemistry and engaging cinematography. The use of sex and religion is thematically well crafted. TI West constructs a soft-core horror porno that leaves much to be explored.",2022-10-02
"There are no mutant hillbilly killers or even supernatural predators overpowering the city folk in this somewhat interesting disaster. If you desired Shyamalan's Old to feature way more freelove while yearning to explore paths less traveled, then you're in for a feature created by young people that think old people are all about missing out on sexual promiscuity.",2022-04-17
"There seems to be a concerted effort to make A24 movies ""a thing"". Of course they have a merch store where film nerds can buy something related to the current release, much of it ""limited edition"". On the face of it looks as if they are trying to create cult movies, which isn't something that can be done intentionally.X is a good example. It has many of the ingredients of a 70s/80s straight to video horror movie, but it lacks the atmosphere, fun and tension of the original video nasties. In short its pretty boring despite some ok visuals every now and then.The story is set around a low budget film crew making an adult movie on some creepy old couple'(because old age is the new horror apparently) ranch. Its basically a slasher but with pretentions of being more high brow. The kills are predictable and not very entertaining, as a result there is zero tension leading up to them.Mia Goth is probably the biggest name attached to this, she has an unusual face as she can appear beautiful sometimes but very plain at other times. I am still undecided. What I am decided on is that these A24 movies are basically hype which seem to attract people who think they have ""superior taste"" because nobody likes what it is they profess to enjoy. Edgy.What is also unclear is why they didn't cast old actors for the elderly couple, as a result they do not seem convincing. Apparently being almost 100 doesn't affect their eyesight, hearing or memory either. Nor their sex drive.Its actually quite bad taste but as long as hipsters keep buying the merch for their Instagram pics, I have no doubt A24 will keep churning this guff out. Just don't try and convince me this is decent film making or that it isn't ""old age horror"" for twentysomethings who think 35 is old.",2022-10-12
"This slasher could be a good homage to the 70's and 80's movies of the same genre, but, in my opinion, it only falls into the category of unintentional satire.Let's look at the good things first. The production design is the first thing that jumps out at you as a great success. The direction is also good, having good sequences. Finally, there are certain details in editing that also raise the standard of the film.Now let's skin the rest of the film. The script is lousy. This movie is FULL of stupid decisions, that only exist to favor the poor show exhibited. It has a lot of Jump Scares, but they all fail, because they are announced long before. The sound editing is good, but the soundtrack is lousy, because it's never a complement that helps create a terrifying environment. It's not a scary movie, it's not a funny movie, it's not a deep movie, although it tries to be with a good theme, but it's totally out of place. Regarding the effects, it's appreciated that they wanted to stick to those of the time and stick to the practical effects, but they were horrible. The only decent thing is the elderly costumes, but they aren't convincing either. I don't understand how this movie has been one of the most popular of the year, when in reality it's boring, meaningless, without grace, without anything. I'll probably skip the prequel, because it doesn't interest me in the slightest.",2022-10-05
"This was a movie that when I learned about it, I was excited. I try to temper my expectations in cases like this to not be let down. Ti West is a writer/director who has movies that I enjoy, so that added to it. From the bit of the trailer I saw, this had my attention. Jaime and I went to see this at the Gateway Film Center during opening weekend. I've now given it a second viewing ahead of making my top horror films of 2022 list.Synopsis: in 1979, a group of young filmmakers set out to make an adult film in rural Texas, but when their reclusive, elderly hosts catch them in the act, the cast find themselves fighting for their lives.Now the synopsis is a bit off, but that is the gist of the movie. We start by seeing the aftermath of something. Sheriff Dentler (James Gaylyn) arrives and he's joined by deputies and other police officers. Whatever happened here was a bloodbath. The movie then shifts 24 hours before.We then meet Maxine (Mia Goth). She is in a dressing room and snorting cocaine. She is joined by her boyfriend, Wayne (Martin Henderson), who is also her boss. From what I'm gathering, Maxine is a stripper of sorts. She works with Bobby-Lynne (Brittany Snow). As the premise said, they're going off to rural Texas to make an adult film. Wayne is the executive producer. The director and cinematographer is RJ (Owen Campbell). He also wrote the screenplay. Also joining them is his girlfriend, Lorraine (Jenna Ortega), who is working as the boom microphone operator as well as his production assistant. The male star of this movie is Jackson (Kid Cudi).The movie does well in establishing that during this time in in Texas, things are hard. To save money, they're renting a boarding house from Howard (Stephen Ure). It is a long drive to get there. They are also in a deeply religious area. We get this from a gas station they stop off at where the clerk is watching a televangelist on television. This minister is Simon Prast. I should also point out that Howard watches this same preacher at home.Just a bit more background about our group, Maxine wants to be a star and will do whatever she can to get there. Bobby-Lynne understands her place and doesn't have issues using her body to get what she wants. Wayne wants to make money and I like that he even references Debbie Does Dallas as his inspiration for what he is doing. RJ wants to be a real filmmaker and he sees this as his first chance.When they arrive at the farm, they're 'greeted' by Howard. He doesn't seem to remember their agreement and he's not nice. There is an uneasy understanding between him and Wayne. It doesn't help that Wayne is a smooth talker. Howard wouldn't approve of what they're doing either. Maxine notices someone looking down at them from a window. This turns out to be Howard's wife, Pearl.Our group goes about shooting their movie, but things take a dark turn as our hosts are scarier than the group originally thought.Now that seems like enough of fleshing out the synopsis and introducing our characters a bit more. Where I want to start is that I believe this movie does a great job at its set up. Jaime and I were talking after the movie ended and I said that West is known for doing slow-burns. She didn't think this movie was slow from the start. I can agree with her there, but the horror elements don't start until I'd say past the halfway point. She pointed out though, we get the making of this adult film that keeps your interest until then. I agree there. I'd even go farther to say that dread starts the moment this group gets into the rural part of Texas. They're from Houston if memory serves. Where they go is closer to Louisiana as we are getting bayous. This movie does feel like it borrows a bit from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre or even Eaten Alive. I don't mind the paying homage with the story elements. With this second watch, I noticed there are also ones to certain shots and how things are framed which I appreciate.Where I'll take this then is the social commentary here. Some people might groan at this, but it is done subtle. The major one we get is sexuality. Maxine and Bobby-Lynne both are comfortable with theirs. They don't mind getting naked or having sex with someone they don't have deeper feelings for. Wayne has even come to terms with it from life experiences. Both women have sex with Jackson on film. Maxine has an interesting backstory that doesn't necessarily add a lot, but it is an interesting reveal. Knowing this coming in makes more sense with a recurring item. Now we are juxtaposing this with Lorraine. Her nickname in the movie is 'Church Mouse'. She doesn't talk a lot. She also stares at the other women and they think she is a prude. She does surprise everyone by also wanting to be in the movie after they've gotten started. This is interesting as it upsets RJ. This becomes the catalyst for the events of the night.Sticking with the idea of sexuality, we have Pearl. She interacts with Maxine and we get some reveals to her character through pictures. I didn't understand fully until things that happen later. This elderly couple harbors secrets and I found it to be interesting. I do find some of this problematic though, just due to their age and how things play out. It doesn't ruin the movie though. This is also taking on the idea of sexuality and contrasting it to religion. It tends to make people more prudish, hence the nickname for Lorraine and things that are said by the televangelist. It makes sense for a reveal of a character for sure. Our group also knows that what they're doing is wrong in not telling Howard. Wayne is taking advantage of him. It also builds tension with worry about him finding out. To finish out this idea on secrets, it is interesting that Howard watches this preacher on television, while also doing the things that he does and covering for his wife.I don't think there is more that I need to go into with the story, so I'll take this to the acting. I thought it was good across the board. Goth is solid as our lead here. She is one that doesn't do a lot, but I'm loving that she's stuck to the horror genre for most of her young career so far. What works for her is that she is determined to be a star. There is also a past with her that worked. She just goes beyond her character as well. Ortega is good as our reserved woman in the group. I liked seeing Snow as the more sexualized lady. We do see her and Goth nude if you're interested. Kid Cudi was good as Jackson. I liked Henderson as our greasy character. I was glad to see Campbell here as he's an actor that has impressed me in everything that I've seen, this included. Ure and the rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed as well.That will then take me to the effects, cinematography and soundtrack. This movie becomes a slasher film with exploitation elements. I like that the kills are implementing different tools you'd find on a farm. That adds a good element. They are also brutal. From what I could tell they were practical. If not, they hid what they were doing well which worked for me. The cinematography is great. We get some beautiful shots and I also think it is edited masterfully. There is homage here as well with some shots to Texas Chainsaw which I thought were a good touch. The soundtrack is something else that I thought works well. We get songs from the era. There is also music that ramps up the tension and the atmosphere.In conclusion, I'm glad that I saw this. We are getting an interesting period piece slasher film. There are elements that add commentary, which ticks boxes for me. The acting is good across the board. I thought the effects were as well and they go brutal. This movie looks beautiful and of the era. What they do with the soundtrack works as well. I'll be honest that I have this up there as one of my favorite West films. I thought this was good after my first viewing and that is just cemented with giving it a rewatch. One of my favorites of the year, as well as in the slasher genre in general.My Rating: 9 out of 10.",2022-11-20
"I watched this with my friends because we thought the premise was interesting and it's got a pretty stacked cast. What we saw was your typical straight-to-streaming horror film.It's the type of film that doesn't have the right vibe to watch together with friends but it doesn't really merit a properly focussed alone viewing either. I can't remember it enough for the jumpscares or the tension, but I do remember some good acting performances, especially from Jenna Ortega. Hers is the only character with some depth it seems but to be fair you're not exactly looking for depth in a film about porn.Overall I'd say it seems like the film had a last-minute idea but it was carried out really well, so not exactly a masterpiece. But I hope the filmmaker keeps going, you'll get there! :)",2022-09-20
"I enjoyed my time with X, but I definitely feel it falls victim to mediocrity. There's so many promising flourishes in the film's brooding first and second acts, but then the third act is in too much of a rush to kill everyone off and reach the finish line. Ultimately I felt like even the little I knew about this movie was too much. Maxine was so clearly signposted as the final girl that anytime she was put in danger it lacked any kind of tension. The film's marketing doesn't make any effort to hide the fact it's a slasher, so you spend the entire movie waiting for it only to be disappointed by those elements anyway. If I had gone in blind, the unsettling atmosphere during the day would've amounted to so much more, and the sudden flux of kills would've shocked me and had me guessing right to the end. But X didn't offer me any much more than that to make it feel like a worthy watch, including the last minute twist which felt like a meaningless addition that had no effect on anything before or after. I give X a really well-made, yet mediocre 6/10.QyrosMovies.",2022-10-17
"This is a very well done, artsy horror film about beauty, sexuality, death, and life choices. It's very interesting, very different than most horror films. It evokes some different emotions, from lust to disgust. And it is made to look like it is from 1979, the year it takes place in, which I love. It almost resembles a Rob Zombie movie. It's very aesthetically pleasing. And I found out that the lead also plays the old woman, which shows what a great actor she is.",2022-06-11
"X brought me back to what old school horror used to be and that is why I enjoyed it so much. From the brutal kills, buckets of blood, and surprises throughout. Director Ti West did a great job here and shows that you don't need a big budget to make a great horror movie. The premise is pretty straight to the point but there is still more substance to be found under the layers. Now X will not be for everyone because of how graphic it is. Anyone who has read the synopsis of the film knows it is about a group of people who spend the night on an old couples property to film a XXX film. We then get to meet an old lady Pearl who we find out is not all there and seems to be set off by the group of people who are visiting. Things escalate from there and revelations are discovered. This is how a horror film should be done. X gets an 8 out of 10 from me.",2023-07-02
"The first thing that stands out with X is it's gorgeous cinematography. This feels like a movie shot in the 70s. The costumes, makeup, even some of the accents are spot on. Several shots feel straight out of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which this film obviously pays hommage to.The writing is far better than most slasher films, and the acting is quite good as well with some exceptions, most notably the kill scenes.Unfortunately for a horror movie, the death scenes in particular feel off. They hold back a lot, especially with the female characters, which is unlike 70s movies, but more importantly, the pacing and acting are off. A Friday the 13th and similar movies knew how to perfectly pace a kill scene. Here, people often stare at each other way too long before the kill, which makes the fact that the killers are frail 90 year olds stabbing and shooting young adults all the more unbelievable. For example one young male is stabbed in the neck, with the knife stuck in there, and doesn't even attempt to fight back. Such a wound would not lead to paralysis, on the contrary, the blood loss would be slow, and the reaction violent with the body full of adrenalin. Such a wound may be fatal is untreated, but it would take a long time to bleed out, and he could have most definitely fought back.Similarly with another character who is shot point blank with a shotgun, despite the murderous intent being clear, and him having ample time to wrestle the gun from the killer.The heart attack scene could have used some forshadowing and also felt weirdly off pace and badly acted to the point where I suspected it to be a ruse at first.The movie is also way too long, as low budget horror films tend to be. 20-30 minutes shaved off the runtime would make for a far better viewing. After such a long film, there's no real payoff at the end either.All that being said, the movie does get the feeling right. It's not a grindhouse style parody, but a genuine love letter to the 70s, and the few flaws can be generously overlooked. If you're looking for old school horror, X is recommended over this year's umpteenth Texas Chainsaw Massacre reboot.",2022-04-14

"Why is the movie purposely shot out of focus? This bugged me so much that I couldn't concentrate on what was going on.Film scanned at 4K is sharp, even 60s/70s amateur auteur movies that this is trying, so hard, to emulate. Don't believe me? Take a look at the 4K scan of ""Debbie does Dallas"" a movie that was filmed prior to this one in this movie's universe.The whole movie looks like it was filmed on a flip phone, or per scanned at 240p and upscaled on a Pentium II.Show some respect for the medium.

"This movie is a tribute to the horror movies of the last century, but it doesn't quite convince me.The resemblance to certain horror films and their homage to them is visible, but I see it more as a copy of the conveniences and how predictable most of them were, I think that if this weren't an A24 film or a known director, it would be an atrocity, due to how predictable it is, and how little fear it causes. The story is written as if it were a psychological horror movie, where not much happens until the last minutes, where emotions are linked to terror, something that do not cause much terror and very boring, and this time is no exception, not much happens during the whole movie, and what happens is not scary or tense, everything becomes very predictable, and the ending seemed very absurd to me, since there was no extensive development to justify that, or even to leave clues of it's interpretation, but honestly I didn't understand it at all. The technical aspects are what save this film, the performances are phenomenal, the cinematography is good, the production design is very good and some of the visual effects are convincing.The story made me despise this film, I could never see it as a tribute, it seemed like a poorly made copy with an unexciting story and a direction that does not cause fear or transmit terror.",2022-09-22
"To quote the late great DNX (RIP) ""X Gonna Give it to Ya."" X is set in 1979 rural Texas where a group of young filmmakers set out to make an adult film, but when their reclusive, elderly hosts catch them in the act, the cast finds themselves fighting for their lives. Spoiler warnings as there is a lot to break down here.X is one of the craziest films I have ever watched, but it's actually a lot deeper than your normal horror/ slasher film. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and I actually left the theater blown away, not sure fully what to think about what I had just watched. Now usually, I'm not a horror fan, and to be honest, I only watched this movie because Brittany Snow is in it. I'm one of her biggest fans, and I was worried when I heard she was going to be in this and that she was going to be naked. But I have to say she totally killed it, and she steals every scene she is in. She alone makes the film worth seeing. Brittany Snow plays Bobby-Lynne, an adult film star who is setting out to mark on the world opposite Kid Cudi and Mia Goth. Kid Cudi's, Mia Goth's, and Jenna Ortega's characters are likable too, just not as much as Brittany's. However, there is more depth to Bobby-Lynne than meets the eye. She is sexy, funny, smart, and near the end, even kind-hearted. Also, the scene where she sings Landslide is simply beautiful. Her voice is so amazing, and the way it is cut with the old lady broke my heart. It literally almost made me cry. I wish we would've seen more of her character. Now there is the fact that Brittany Snow is naked in this movie. There is a lot of nudity in X, which is why it isn't for everyone and probably isn't' a movie to watch with mom and dad. But for the most part, the nudity is more artistic than it is just for the sake of nudity. And, like it or not, it is part of the plot and the film's larger themes. It was strange to see Brittany Snow, someone I consider a personal hero, naked. But as I look at it, this is a job to her and that she consented to do it. No one forced her to, and she got paid for it. Also, it didn't feel dirty or crude, and from her interviews, it sounds like they did everything they could to make her feel comfortable. Honestly, she looks amazing, and it was as tasteful as it could be (Kid Cudi is a lucky man). But like I said, that is just a small part of much greater performance. And while I don't think it is her best performance ever, it is amazing. And I love that people are finally giving her the praise I feel like she has deserved for a long time now. My only complaints would be that she should've been the main star and that she shouldn't have died. I was secretly hoping that she would end up being the hero, but they had to kill her off. If she did have to go, getting eaten by an Alligator is pretty Bad A**. However, I feel like it is kind of getting old in these movies where everyone dies except one person, and you can figure out who that person is in the first five minutes. I know that this was meant to be a throwback to the 80s slasher films, but they could've changed it up a bit.I would also almost argue that it is more grotesque than horror. Yeah, there are some scary or tense moments, but overall I felt that it was more going for shock. As far as violence goes, for the most part, there is nothing worse than your average episode of the walking dead. The only death I felt might have been a bit too much was the first one. Where it gets weird is the nudity and the old people sex stuff. On the one hand, I enjoyed that this film wasn't about two old religious people trying to punish people they deemed as sinners, which I feel has been done to death. But on the other hand, I never really got the old people's motivation. I mean, I get it that the old lady wants to feel beautiful and still has needs, and her husband can't get it up, or he'll die. So, I get her motivation, but why is he doing this? He's sad he can't get it up anymore? Also, I still don't know what they were going to do to Mia Goth. Lastly, I feel like the film became a bit cliche once they started killing off characters. I get that you need some cliches here and there, but I could see almost every death coming from a mile away. However, I will say that this film is more about its characters than the violence. Hence why I would label it grotesque.Overall I give it an 8.5 out of 10
Minus one star for Killing off Brittany's character and a half star for the character's deaths being too cliche and predictable. Bonus points for naked Brittany.It is a stunning smark, sexy, funny, and F**** up film, and if you have the stomach for it, I would highly recommend it for Brittany Snow alone.",2022-03-23
"Directed by Ti West, who was behind the very interesting 'The Innkeepers (2011)' and 'The Sacrament (2013)', this also stars Mia Goth, one of the most interesting performers around.The results form a slow-burning slasher film built on an interesting premise: set in 1979, the main cast are staying on an isolated farm to make 'The Farmer's Daughters', a film set in the burgeoning pornography industry. Apart from the in-fighting among the cast and crew, there's also the business of the disapproving owners of the farm, octogenarians Howard (Stephen Ure) and his wife Pearl.There's some interesting bi-play between them all, but then things begin to get a little ridiculous, although events are based on real killings carried out by Ray & Faye Copeland in the mid-'80s.Performances are good across the board, and the New Zealand location is put to effective use - beautiful, but remote. Strange though, even with the advancements made in effects and prosthetics, the 'old age make-up', as used here, is never very convincing.Goth is good as always in both her roles - she has long since deserved the chance to play a part that gives her something interesting to do - although the reason she is playing two roles is only superficially interesting. Or, put another way, seems to be a bit of a gimmick. My score is 6 out of 10.",2022-10-14
"2nd viewing of this. Rewatched as result of watching Pearl. I gotta say, I have a new found appreciation for this movie. I liked it the first time around, but now I really like this. (My previous score was 6/10, that score has certainly gone up now.) It was cool to catch the moments where the two movies intertwined.Pearl had lived this life for so many decades and is still going strong. (Apparently her husband also joined her in the madness at some point.) She feels like the years have passed her by. She wants to be young again and misses being touched by Howard (her husband). All the events in the film eventually brings them together, and also tears them apart.This film slowly builds up for most of the run time, which is good. For this type of film, you want that slow burn. Too much action, too quickly would be overkill.I love how all the kills come in a relatively short amount of time. It's one right after another, in a span of what felt like 15-20 minutes. All the kills were really nice. My favorite death was the one in the pond, followed by the one in the barn. Great stuff.The acting in this wasn't anything special. But then again, you don't watch something like this and expect Oscar worthy performances.I don't know how to describe it. This movie has a certain charm to it. Most of my ""review"" feels like random thoughts cause I'm at a loss for words.It's a great time, great watch, tons of fun. Watch this, especially after watching Pearl.This gets a LennyReviewz Score of: 8/10.",2023-01-31
"X needs to be applauded for its wild script idea and its freaking implementation. Kudos to Ti West for trying something like this in this modern era. The cast have just nailed it with their performance especially Mia Goth's old women and Stephen Ure's old man can shiver your timbers with her sick performance. Brittany Snow does her adult star which is the main entertainment in the first half of the movie. Jenna Ortega's orthodox religious girl is another thing to watch out for. Violence, Blood Splatter,Nudity and Sex forms the core of the movie which makes it strictly an adult material. The eye popping style kills are the main thing to watch out for that elevates the movie to better levels. The setting and mystic BGM provides the vintage feel the movie deserved.The time the movie takes to get things going is the only con of the whole tale. Slow take in the first half may be not everyone's cup of tea.A24 delivers hell of a movie experience proving themself king of sick wild movies.Rating:68/100.",2022-10-02
"The theme here is jealousy, sex, and the longing to feel wanted.An intense film about an old couple wanting to have what has been long lost, and taking it out on a group of adventurous youth looking to film a porno and make major bucks.Leave it to studio A24, they have yet to make a sub-par horror movie. It's got it all: thrills, excitement, scares, wtf scenes, violence, gore, shock value, effective directing and acting, good stuff. The editing might be a little strange and inept, especially some of the more ""experimental"" aspects, and the make-up had a lot to be desired (I mean, why not just cast REAL old people?), but it's well made.It feels like what the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre should have felt like.",2022-10-02
"How can a horrifying slasher movie be also such a beautiful film? Ask the creators of ""X"".At first glance, a movie about some people going to a remote farm to shoot an adult film sounds like an actual adult film from the 70s, but the acting is amazing, the characters are so well written, and the photography is beautiful, haunting and terrifying.Talking about the cast, this is the third movie this year in which I see Jenna Ortega, two of them being horror films, and I have to say she is one amazing actress, and I am looking forward to seeing her as Wednesday Addams in the upcoming Netflix series.Going back to ""X"", the film catches you by surprise, you think by the title and plot you think it's going to be just another slasher, but this film is packed with true gore, suspense and horror.This is by far one of the best and scarier slashers I have ever seen, which coming from someone who's a huge horror fan, it is a lot.",2022-04-25
"Well made, excellent cinematography, some good ideas and the dialogue is quite good.The premise is somewhat preposterous, but the central themes are universal and universally relevant.The story, however, is disjointed and the film lacks surprises and there is an utter lack of tension. There is humor, both intended and not, very mediocre music and amazing feats of strength from the feeble. Jesus, of course, is present, too.In order to fulfill the new 600 character minimum here's some blah:In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content.

"And so is Ti West, apparently, because if he were a little sharper he'd have picked up a bit more on Tobe Hooper's subtlety, darkness and Southern Gothic flair in superior flicks that obviously inspired this heap of trash; most notably the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) and Eaten Alive (1976). Tobe Hooper was actually from the South and it's painfully obvious that Ti West has about as much of a grasp on real Southern American culture as he does about rutabaga farming in the south of France.This is just painful to watch. The characters are caricatures, and it's not even artfully done with sly humor in the way Rob Zombie can pull similar stunts off. The comedy is low brow, adolescent, and literally no one in the porn industry behaves the way the strippers do in the first 20 minutes of this film. The fact that Ti West actually believes sex workers are more excited about sex work than oh say going for a swim, going out for drinks, or just reading a book in their bedroom speaks volumes on West's ignorance on the nature of adult entertainment. Ti West clearly doesn't get that sex work is WORK.And what is UP with the COW scene? Tobe Hooper's original masterpiece was a criticism of the brutality and barbarity of factory farming (and Hooper was in fact a vegetarian at the time he made Chainsaw) and to me this scene in X looks like average ""meat troll"" on Twitter having a borderline sociopathic giggle about animal cruelty. Is it a clumsy device that is supposed to show us what disgusting people the main characters are?This movie is just unbearable. I honestly would hate Ti West now if Pearl hadn't redeemed him in some fundamental way.",2023-04-15
"This film start with a police officer arrive at a house, and he checking a dead body scene!

"When i heard of Ti West putting out a new horror I immediately wanted to see it. Have seen almost all his features and i do like them. This one had the promo of Hereditary on it, a flick that was overrated for me.Luckily I didn't bother about that and watched this rather gory flick. Divided in two parts, first part is the sexy part with a lot of nudity involved normal because it's all about making a porn flick. I was surprised how far they went to make it look like a porn, the score even the echoes used and the look of cinematography took me back to the heydays when porn was a normal thing in theaters. Slowly you can see that the place they are shooting doesn't look what it should be, the owners, the heat, the emptiness surrounding the house, yes, deep south USA, it has that Texas Chainsaw Massacre atmosphere.After exactly on hour the gore comes in, and let me say, it is really one for the gorehounds. And it's even here and there an ode to the old slashers. In fact, this is a slasher.I did like this one on every part. Been a while since I enjoyed a good new horror but this one delivers. And I can understand that some reviews are very negative. But for those grown up in the early eighties as i am then you will enjoy this dark gory slasher flick.Gore 3,5/5
Nudity 3/5
Effects 3/5
Story 2,5/5
Comedy 0/5.",2022-05-09
The most horrifying part of this movie was when I woke up and realised it still wasn't over.I thought the alligator did an excellent job acting like it needed to be in this movie.The Visit and Skeleton Key are better options.,2022-03-19
"So I had to see what all the hype was about this movie. I read the reviews from most people and it seemed as though the ratings were split. I usually don't pay attention to what others have to say about a movie because it's all a matter of opinion anyway. Certain movies have high ratings and aren't worth watching while others have low ratings and are. So I decided to give it a try and come up with my own opinion.First off, I liked the cinematography of this movie, but for me it truly lacked in story. An group of young people try to make a porno on a farmland that is owned by an older couple. Then about half way through, the old lady and her husband goes on a murderous rampage. I just sat there anticipating that there was more to it than just them, but to my dismay there wasn't.Secondly, the old lady who you later find out is none of than a woman named Pearl. She was upset that she couldn't get what she wanted, like having sex with her husband. He was afraid to do so due to his heart condition, however they ended up having sex anyways with one of the characters underneath the bed. Towards the end of the movie he ends up dying of a heart attack because of a ""jump scare""! I was like what the crap!!Then at the end of the movie there happens to be a ""Big. Reveal"" that was quite predictable. Which left me saying to myself, who really cares!! At no point in this movie did was I ever invested in any of these characters. In fact there were several times that I wanted to completely stop watching it towards the ending, but I figured that I was this far into it that I should watch the whole thing.I'm all for horror movies that don't really have a plot to it, I mean I watched Rubber which is literally about a killer tire. How much absurd of a plot can you get!! However I truly enjoyed watching Rubber, even though it was quite cheesy to say the least. X on the other hand I didn't enjoy at all and I feel like I got dumber after watching it. Don't take my opinion on this movie, watch it and make your own opinions about it. After all we have our own likes and dislikes, I just know that I am not a fan!!",2023-04-28
"A slasher film where the killers are a sex crazed elderly women and her impotent husband? SOLD. I really liked this film, I thought it was great. The best horror film I've seen since Malignant. I especially liked the grainy 70's style film stock. The other thing that stood out was the sex scene between the old couple. I thought it was brilliant, creepy but brilliant. It has to be one of the most unusual sex scenes in horror film history. I can definitely see this film becoming a cult classic. 7 stars.",2022-04-14
"I really enjoyed this film. Harked back to good old fashioned horror from the days of video nasties. Growing up in the 80s I noticed lots of references to horror movies from days gone by:
Friday the 13th - in the way sex is featured throughout and the setting - the lakePsycho - old woman motif, shower scene referenceTexas Chainsaw Massacre / The Hills Have Eyes with the setting and various characters and feelthe Shining - one scene with a door and an axeEvil Dead - cabin in the woods, basementSuspiria - use of primary colours in one sceneThe use of flashing edits (not sure what the technical name is) is interesting and feels a bit art house.I didn't have high expectations for this but was interested and engaged throughout. Recommended for those who like a retro feel horror with a coherent plot.",2023-02-27
"The Movie starts with some Nostalgia, The Young People in the Van - 70s, first thing that comes to mind is clearly Texas Chainsaw Massacre, also thanks to the Filmmakers that the song In the summertime by Mungo Jerry plays in one scene , I heard this song after watching this Movie. Even when the Movie is a bit slow at the beginning It becomes more and more dark , violent and suspenseful . The Acting was decent, I also liked the Message behind the Movie (yes there was one ) and there was also some nice gore scenes. Some People say the premise of the movie doesn't make sense and its weak ( these People probably love generic Superhero Movies) at the end the premise of the movie isn't much unimaginable as people think. For me X was better than most Blumhouse Movies, It tries something different ( even not really new) but this movie was definitely worth watching and better than most recent Horror Movies.",2022-06-04
"A remarkably unscary, unentertaining version of the Texas chainsaw massacre. I rarely write reviews but I just have to write a review on this. How did this get an average score of 6.9? That's so high for a horror movie on IMDb. And I have watched hundreds of horror movies, I'm not a horror snob or elitist or anything. I love every kind of horror, new and old. But this was just overwhelmingly average. The bad guys (old couple) makeup was so fake and every time I looked at them pretending to be old I almost died of cringe. Just get actual old people actors rather than getting young people and give them tons of makeup to pretend to be old. It was like watching white chicks - black guys pretending to be white women, it was that obviously fake. Although at least that was the premise of white chicks.The alligator scene was pretty cool and so was the constant stabbing with the pitchfork, and the neck stabbing scene. The first 30 minutes had me intrigued and the protagonists were good throughout, especially the female lead. Just the horror element was super weak. There were no surprises other than a small but trivial surprise at the very end. It just made me nostalgic for the Texas chainsaw massacre. I might go and watch that right now!",2022-04-20
"A very straight forward horror film about a group of pornographers trapped into a hellhole of bunker. I do not get the hype. I get that it was slight fun and all but its a run-of-the-mill slasher that does not dumb down its victims. So a bit of a win for me, who hates this predisposition in the Slasher genre.Overall, its just ok. The filmmaking was ok. The acting was fine. Not really note worthy. The XXX star actors knows what film they are in. The story is lacking but is able to stood ground well enough. I do not get the Jenna Ortega's characters mindset of wanting suddenly to be a bigger part of things. Just does not make sense. But for the most part, Its just plainly do what it needs to do, be a jumpstart for a franchise.Just enough.",2022-11-03

Seriously what is the lesson to be drawn? That life is too short and you should have as much sex as you can before getting too old because otherwise you go around killing the ones who can ?? Except for some successful gore material there is nothing in this movie. High rating probably comes from teenagers with high levels of sex hormones. Lol.,2022-05-16

There really isn't much to say other than this movie was so intense. It might seem a little slow at first but it gives enough background and dialogue to keep things interesting. The gore was brutal and the characters were almost all likeable. I felt like I was watching a classic slasher movie just with better story and graphics!!!,2022-03-18
"I don't ever really write reviews but I can't help myself with this one. I do not understand all the buzz surrounding this movie because quite frankly, it's not very good. Even after seeing the trailers I had my trepidations about the movie, the setup seemed flimsy and forced and I wasn't sure how the film was going to get from point A to point B. Lo and behold, the plot is flimsy and forced. It had a very promising first act and I was starting to change my mind but after a really cheesy montage set to a not-very-good cover of ""Landslide"", the film falls apart and loses direction. No offense to Mia Goth, I'm sure she's a great actress, but Maxine is NOT final girl material. This movie is sequel baiting so painfully hard. No wonder they pumped out 2 other in-universe films already. The whole point of this movie is to set up a new franchise. I'm so sick of A24 style horror movies. I love A24 dramas but this ""intelligent horror"" wave really does not bode well for the genre of this is where it's headed. Overrated film that loses all direction after a promising start. I don't get any of the hype.",2022-10-06
"I love film-in-film movies. 'X' - the 2022 film from director Ti West - is a horror film set during the filming of a pornographic film in 1979. Ti West manages - in my opinion - to make a smart and surprisingly nostalgic film about the era in which the story takes place and about the low-cost cinema industry of those times, but at the same time he makes a shasher that will also satisfy the fans of this cinematographic genre. True, they have to wait until almost halfway through the film, when the action really kicks in and the blood starts flowing, but what happens from here on out will fully satisfy their expectations. Quality nostalgic film and extreme horror rarely meet and work together, but here we are dealing with one of those cases.The film has eight characters. Six of them are the members of a film team looking for a low-cost location for the filming of an adult movie and find it in an unused building on a farm in the vastness of Texas, owned by an old couple with an unsettling physiognomy and with a rather hostile behavior, which should accentuate the doubts of young people. As in most genre films, the audience is much more aware of the dangers than the protagonists. The members of the filming team - an avant-garde director looking for work at any cost, his girlfriend - a nice and shy girl, at least at first -, two actresses and a porn actor and the producer - enthusiastically launch into filming, without paying attention to the effect that their behavior has on the elderly. Indifference will cost them.Ti West faced a challenge: making a film about low-cost cinema with low-cost means, but which doesn't look low-cost. I think that he was well inspired and cinematographically succeeded in a big way. First of all, he chose his actors very well - seven actors for eight roles, because yes - there is a double role that surprises most of the viewers, I think, as it surprised me. The visuals are excellent and the dual use of high-dive footage creates remarkable effects. Alternating between screen formats, West switches cinematic styles between those practiced in 1979 and 2022. The soundtrack offers a veritable anthology of the music that any youngster knew and loved in the 70s. A word of warning, though. There will be viewers who will not like everything that can be seen on the screen in this movie. Those who avoid gory horror films will do well to avoid 'X', and so should do those who can't stand nudity or sex in movies. These didn't bother me, I consider them part of the cinematic convention. Instead I felt less comfortable with turning old age into a source of horror. I find it problematic, but maybe I should also see the 'prequel' ('Pearl') - released six months after this film, also directed by Ti West and co-written with the excellent actress Mia Goth who appears in both films - in order to have a complete perspective. Rumors go that a sequel is in making, so 'X' has a chance to become a new series of horror films, but - I hope - not an ordinary one. With all the reservations and questions raised by this movie, I will watch it.",2022-12-20
"To preface this review, I haven't watched a lot of horror movies - I only know of Texas Chainsaw Massacre because I watched a shortened version of it on Youtube. And ""X"" is supposed to be a homage to that movie. I am disappointed that I couldn't fully appreciate the connection due to my lack of knowledge, but the homage was pretty obvious, even to a noob like me.""X"" to me was a 7. It felt like a well-made horror/thriller/slasher film.In the beginning, we see a bunch of young people head to a rural farmhouse (equivalent to an Airbnb of the 70s) to shoot an ""avant-garde"" pornographic video, under the leadership of a middle aged director. The names are hardly important. The movie starts with pretty good buildup with very subtle, but great foreshadowing (e.g. The black ""cock"", unloaded gun, dead cow, super religious broadcast). When the movie was half shoot, most people except one, Maxine, are slain by the elderly owners of the farmhouse.The structure of the movie was divided into two parts: pre-shooting and post-shooting. Most of the killings occur in the night after the shooting. It mostly filled the horror part pretty well. I was pretty spooked for the latter half of the film mostly because Pearl (the old lady) was just such a spooky character and the setting was really appropriate. The prosthetics on the old couple made them look very VERY old on purpose to make them more villainous. Couple jump-scares were pretty effective, but not all. I loved that the movie had an intricate dichotomy between porn and horror (though the porn part was short). Fear and sex are basically two sides of the same coin so I thought it was an interesting writing choice. Also want to add that I noticed that there were some great music and sounds that incorporated moaning sounds fittingly.There were some amazing cinematography weaved into the film. My personal favorite was the shot where Pearl gets increasingly red as the blood from her victim splashes onto the headlight of the car. Incredible shot and added dramatic effect because she was wearing a white dress. And I had no idea that this was a dual role performance by Mia Goth. Prosthetics were incredible that I completely didn't even realize it. What a phenomenal performance.Unlike typical slasher movies, we actually have moments where the audience could experience the depth of their emotion. Pearl could not let go of her past beauty and had the desire to be wanted and reaffirmed. Howard was her husband who seemingly cannot fulfill her desires because of his health. The murders actually had somewhat of a basis because a bunch of young people filming porn is a portrayal of what they want but can't have especially given the religious context, hence causing the rage. However, I do want to point out that this was their repeat offense based on the sunken car and the hung missing person and I am hearing that we will be getting a prequel as well to explain their past more.The movie actually brings an interesting topic - sex at old age. Old people still have sex but it almost feels even more taboo talking about it. Age is something that everyone has to experience and yet it feels incredibly disturbing to even observe elderly sex on screen because we are just so not used to it. Sex is a beautiful act among all ages and one should be able to accept that or I think they become monsters like Pearl and Howard, albeit less violent.All in all, ""X"" was a pleasant surprise, packed with classic slasher vibes along with interesting topic selection.",2022-04-20

This happy go lucky group is very adventurous and go to great lengths to create a movie that is full of natural beauty, humor and fun times. Plus some surprises.The evil elderly couple that rents the property are initially unsupportive of nature films until they are invited by the crew to join in on the fun. Needless to say, everyone has a great time making the film and learning how to make comedy with the old, redneck property owners. In the end the old couple regain a little bit of their lost youth and kindness by being open to new experiences.",2022-07-24
"Watching this movie is like watching every 70's american storiotipe in one, this easily could've gone wrong if the movie took itself too serious, but fortunately it doesn't. Without concern of having some cliche dialogues and campy scenes, the movie still manages to get some screams with it's gruesome. I could argue that the killings were a bit rushed and there could be more running here and there. If you're the most assituaded slasher fan and want the best killing of all time, this movie may not be for you, but if you don't have a problem with making fun of the things you love while also getting some classical horror movie killing, I would definitely recommend it.",2022-08-03

"This movie is described in full for everybody to see before they see it. It is described as p*** actors making a p*** movie so you know they'll be plenty of sex scenes in it. You know there will be nudity. So if people see it and critics and reviewers here and IMDb say that it has too many sex scenes in it, and you know that the majority of them or between a guy that looks like Jackson's character and a girl that looks like the Maxine character. And that is the case. Now if the guy looked like the old man that kissed the Jenny Ortega's character at the beginning of the movie and the critics would never describe the sex in the movie they never indicate that there was any nudity in the movie. In fact the way the critics describe it or the reviewers would describe it in that case, you think it's a romance movie or just a thriller with no nudity and no sex. So the tropes are Alive and Kicking in this movie including the killing of the Jackson character after he has sex with any girl that has the skin tone of Maxine. It is a trashy movie and bombed at the box office. The 10 Stars are for deceptive purposes only. It deserves zero Stars and less. Zeros below this post are complimentary. Also, Vindication has happened for couples with men that look like Jackson and girls that look like Maxine.",2022-11-16

"Just because nothing happens for over a full hour does not necessarily mean it's a slow burn movie, it can just be a very heavily hyped slow movie.""X"" wastes the first full hour of its runtime building on a story that is not only silly and nonsensical, but it's also very forgettable. Equally forgettable are the last forty minutes which is supposed to be the payoff and the bloody money shots. The money shots are there but they come as more of a relief than a payoff. The group in this flick couldn't die fast enough.Really, don't fall for the hype and phony inside praise. This is a bad movie that got top ratings because of a lot of inside chatter and a ton of well-placed hype. Three stars for the fairly decent 1970s look & feel early in the film.Seriously, if you're looking for some really good slow burn horror, look no further than ""Hereditary"", ""Se7en"", ""Alien"", ""A Quiet Place"", and ""Get Out"". If you want to see one of the creepiest and absolute best slow burn flicks, watch ""Taxi Driver"".

"Texas, 1979. Three girls and three guys rent an outbuilding on a farm owned by an old and very strange couple, here they proceed to make a ""dirty movie"". Texas Chainsaw Massacre influences can be seen throughout but this is not an imitation of that classic movie. On their drive to the location they have to slow down, a cow had collided with a big truck, the result a very gory mess. And there is a great deal more blood and gore to follow, splatter fans get their monies worth here. X also has very strong language, violence, sex and nudity. X by name X by nature! The acting is very good, all of the characters are interesting and watchable, Like his previous ""The House of the Devil"" director Ti West gives X a very cool 1970's look, sound and feel. This is my favourite film of his to date. I am very Xcited to see the prequel ""Pearl"" when it comes out.",2023-02-13
"This is the best pure horror movie that I have seen released theatrically in 2022 thus far. It is the best original slasher film that I have seen in the theater since The Devil's Rejects. I liked it as much as the recent Netflix exclusive Texas Chainsaw Massacre.I grew up in rural Texas in this time period. Though I believe the filming locations here are unbelievably in New Zealand, I found the atmosphere here authentic enough.The sets, costumes, and dialogue all seemed to fit the time period. Maybe some characters should have been smoking cigarettes, but American productions seem to have determined that this is the sin of sins now, nevermind that this film is its own nuevo bloody massacre just don't light up before, during, or afterwards.It takes a while to get to the blood and guts of it all but the lead up is still enjoyable with all the aforementioned.The actresses are all beautiful, I knew that was the dude from The Ring, and Kid Cudi surprised me with his acting. He can act. I think he has a bright future in films.There is a creature introduced into the story that brings an unexpected element of non-slasher terror all its very own. The action sequences involved with this creature will surprise and delight audiences who will not be expecting this most welcome story angle. Dare I say, the scenes are even beautiful, and certainly creative, when this creature is on screen.The villains in this film are enjoyable characters. I just feel there needs to be a method to their madness. It doesn't need to be fully explained, but give us more than this is happening just cause, or because it's convenient and they are there.The duration of the film never really explains this.So, stay until the very end. Stay until the final credit has rolled by.There is almost another entire film at the end of the credits. A prequel of sorts.Stick around. You won't regret it. I feel sorry for those that all left during the showing I attended.If you like slasher films, you'll like this movie. I feel it only lacks in humor. It could have used a little bit more comedy. Funny, awkward moments or conversation, zingers, lines, something to give a movie as stylish as this some balance.",2022-03-19
"Old horror films got it, they kept the themes simple and had their own charm, they were fun. As the genre evolved it became more about shock and gore which loses it's impact pretty quickly (if you are into these types of movies) which is why they are so forgettable.Enter X, a modern horror film that keeps it simple. Actually, I must admit that I was surprised that it was a progressing better as a non-horror film. The story and characters (which includes a budget Matthew Mcconaughey) were interesting in the build up and there was some nice cinematography too. Unfortunately it was a bit of a let down when the horror element took over. The ""horror"" aspect, for the most part, made it become more predictable and the antagonists were quite dull.All in all it was a fun film, the way they used to be.",2022-10-04
"1979. A group of young people head out to an isolated farmhouse to shoot an adult movie. The old couple they're renting the house from are happy to take their money but don't approve of what they're doing. Over time the disapproval leads to confrontation...with violent consequences.Horror movies tend to be quite generic and unoriginal. This film is reasonably original, especially by horror standards. It does occasionally feel derivative - The Texas Chainsaw Massacre springs to mind but just about every horror movie owes something to that film.Not bad, but not great either - just okay. I was hoping for s powerful ending but ultimately it is just another splatter fest.",2022-11-06
"With ""X"", Ti West breathes new life into a sub-genre most people believe to have been on life support for the last several decades.Some shots harken back to perhaps the greatest slasher ever made, ""Halloween"", and the movie manages a similarly eerie, frightening atmosphere.The plot concerns a group of pornographers going to stay in an isolated farmhouse where they intend to shoot a movie called ""The Farmer's Daughters"". The farmhouse owners are an eccentric elderly couple who have some violently conflicting views about sex in general. When the old man realises what they're there for, he is haughty and indignant; when the old lady witnesses our heroine's performance, she is jealous. Perhaps they represent both sides of what motivates the censorious attitude toward pornography, simultaneous disgust and attraction - and how both feelings can motivate violence.I didn't even notice while watching that the actress who plays the final girl, Mia Goth, also plays the main bad guy, an ancient woman named Pearl. Goth had to spend ten hours in the make-up chair to look old enough; the effect is subtly unnerving, and it's not every horror movie that continues to scare you after you have watched it, and this just added to the movie's atmosphere which was now quite haunting.I had never been a Ti West fan before watching this movie. With ""X"", however, it's like he finally succeeded in what he was always trying to do: making a genre flick that is at once an homage, and an original. I'd be surprised if this isn't the best horror movie of the year.",2022-07-30
"A pretty solid horror film, and a lot of fun.The film builds slowly, but the suggestive mystery of it for most film fans will be enough. The acting is mostly good, and the story overall is interesting enough. X has lots of nods to the past, from 70's exploitation to classic slasher style films, but at the same time it does boast a few of its own ideas. X builds its suspense originally with the power of suggestion, and then bam, it finally starts to hit with real kills.The film is fairly strong, and most of all, to me the film is fun. And by that, I really mean, it's damn funny. At least to me it was. It's a fun modern film that also pays some tribute to horror tradition. I feel the film has fun with the medium and genre, and definitely doesn't take itself too seriously. That however is definitely not the case with the quickly made sequel.7/10.",2022-07-02
"There is nothing new in this movie. In the first half of the movie nothing happens, really nothing. If you saw 2-3 horror-movies you will in every scene know what's gonna happens next. No joke!",2022-04-13
"This movie had me glued to the big screen for its entire runtime. It was able to have familiar themes splashed with something new, and when executed well, that makes for a really solid film. I'll be seeing someone's face in my nightmares for a while.... Ti West really deserves a lot of credit for this one.",2022-03-18
"'X' is the kind of horror film we want to see today. It looks to the heights of the genre's past but is also highly innovative and character driven. I ended up liking a lot about it despite some of the short comings of the script. The credit must go to lead actress Mia Goth and Ti West's visual style.Horror has been a constant nostalgia trip lately. I know a major discussion point surrounding 'X' is how much of a spiritual child of 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' it is. It's fitting that this movie comes out the same year as a subpar 'Texas Chainsaw' film because yes 'X' reminds me a great deal of the grind house feel. The film is painstakingly visually crafted. The lighting, set design, and especially the costumes have that backwoods filth feel. There are a few moments in the beginning and towards the end where West adds title cards and film grain reminiscent of the 70's but the movie earns it and it doesn't feel cheap or exploitive. That's really the highest compliment you can give a picture look this.Mia Goth gives one of the best recent performances in a horror film in the dual role of the homicidal Pearl and the unhinged Maxine. In fact I think her work in bringing out the subtleties really hammers home the themes that West's script kind of doesn't get. Maxine is young and wants to burn through her youth for all the sexual release and adventure she can get from it while Pearl is what Maxine could become if she had a life of repression. 'X' doesn't always find the right words to say something profound. It's more of a slasher than an elevated slasher but it is Goth that does the elevating.I'd also like to commend the ensemble. This is an extremely well cast film. We all know the complaint about horror films like this that the cast is meant solely to die. That isn't the case here. Every member of our slasher troop is likable and has something of a dramatic arc. I especially liked the juxtaposition between the motivations of Martin Henderson's Wayne and. Jenna Ortega's Lorraine. We understand the nuisances the characters have about sex. It's a movie about smut but none of the characters are shown to deserve death because of some higher morals. In a way 'X' is kind of progressive in the face of some of the uglier ways horror has looked at sexuality.So, yes I would say 'X' is a special horror film that breaths life into the slasher film and lays foundations for new life. After 'Halloween Kills', Netflix's 'Texas Chainsaw', and 'Scream' 'X' is a treat.",2022-09-25
Great horror movie. Not what most would think by the preview. Acting very good. Story good. Could have been alittle more neat at the end.. by just pay attention to the words in the movie from all actors and maybe you will figure the little twist out. If not then watch the credits! You have to watch credits! A must.,2022-04-16

"I'll try to distill the message of this snoozer.Let's see now. A woman who was, surprise, surprise, attractive in her youth, doesn't do the world the courtesy of dying by the age of 35. She continues to age. All the other characters find this repulsive, that nasty aging thing. So the elderly woman becomes the film's monster. She's angry see? Because she can't get laid. Because only people in their early 20s are attractive. See?So now she kills young people because she's bitter. Seriously, this is the entire plot.Do people actually think this? Does everyone just find their moms & grandmothers to be repulsive? Was anyone over the age of 35 involved with this film?Tagline should be: If you hate old women and are so immature as to be scared of aging, this film will terrify you.",2023-03-24
"Disturbing, blood gushing, jaw dropping and all soo very hot and sexy, are a few words that come to mind describing Ti West's new 70s inspired slasher ""X"".

This is by far the most exaggerated movie I have ever seen. I was genuinely so excited to see a horror movie getting a high rating.My hopes were crushed by a brutal horror-impersonating movie. It is not even horror genre per se. It is a mediocre psycho thriller at best.,2022-04-16
"Ok it's straight forward story with little unsettling weirdness.I loved the sets, props and lens filter used to get that 70's movie look.Acting was good and it's is slow burner but I enjoyed it even though you basically know what's going to happen.I don't want to spoil it but it is worth a watch.",2022-03-22
"Overrated. Doesn't get crazy enough for me. The film is a hard R rating and but makes minimal use of it. It is gross and crazy but if you are going gross and crazy then you might as well go all in. Not everyone's cut of tea, not mine. It was just over hyped about people fell over the marketing. The acting was done like the actors were bored out of their mind. Super basic but the plot was what was missing out the most. I would absolutely not recommend this film to anyone mainly because of how boring and basic the film comes off as. Now that we have that out of the way, I would recommend just watching TV.",2023-04-13

Beautiful. The male acting was great and the characters were spot on for the 70's.Classic horror. I just wish this was in the cinema to watch. Soundtrack is spot on.Why didn't I give it a 10/10, because I wanted more nudity haha.""I will not except a life I do not deserve""...",2022-11-24
"Its almost like ""a Pornhub Doco x Texas chainsaw massacre"" . Low budget but well mde and well edited. Great cinematography. Good sound effects.. The house reminds me of the the one in Texas Chainsaw Massacre too. There is no porn in this movie but alot of suspense and even the makeup is reminiscent of the 70s and 80s porn days, quite accurate. Not for kids though. Surprisingly well directed. Much better than alot the trash coming out of Hollywood nowadays.",2022-04-16

"This movie is more than a horror film. In some ways you could call it a art piece. But this movie does mikes generas together well. At one part we have your traditional horror/slasher as things dont go the way of our heros. And the other part is this erotic/thriller since the film students our here to film what is essentially a porno, but the owner does not yet know that yet. The amazing Mia Goth does a great job at portraying Maxime. One of the actors in the film they are shooting and someone you really end up rooting for. Jenna ortega is also here as one of her more early roles at the same time as she played wedensday. I think X is a great film. Would I consider it a great slasher, maybe not but it does do well with the cast and the way it is filmed and overall X becomes more than just a piece of erotica, its almost a piece of art.",2023-05-03
"X is a good, fun, enjoyable, and a pretty disturbing horror movie that played pretty good by all the cast, and though the big weakness of the film is that at least for me, X fills with a predictable death and predictable moment but it's not bad, it's gory, it's bloody, and it's still quite disturbing, overall movie X is still thoroughly entertaining from the beginning to finish, i like it.",2022-04-19
The reviews made us consider it as well as the preview. It's pretty boring. Pretty much nothing happens there's also a lot of porny stuff which is to be expected. Also some gross stuff. It's not scary. There was literally 0 scares in here. Hardly any creepy stuff as well. Surprised we got through it honestly. We would recommend you avoid it unless there's nothing else to watch.,2022-06-13
"Sleazy and gritty and full of charming characterizations and buckets of gore, X hits the spot between modern horror and the more free horror of yesteryear, coming across more like a lost regional horror film from the 70's or 80's than something new.

Hopefully the ratings only increase here and not drop. Watch it and appreciate.",2022-04-16
Mia Goth and the whole cast were good in this porn horror movie. I think that the premise of this movie being a being a horror Flick with porn was pretty good. The setting an old farmhouse with 2 elderly people was pretty creepy and pretty good idea for the movie. I felt the movie was pretty easy to follow and was pretty believable. The p*** was just so sold but the kill scenes were pretty dog on good. This is probably not a good film for the entire family given that the p*** and this is pretty explicit. But if you're a true fan of horror movies you're probably gonna like to watch this one I give Nate out of 10 stars.,2022-10-27
"Ti West set out to make a well made film about a taboo genre about a group setting out to make a well made film in a taboo genre. I watched this because it was a perfect storm of great studio (A24) producing a great director and I heard about it because of a rising star (Jenna Ortega) being in it. She definitely is earning the title of scream queen! And this movie that could have just been a simple slasher flick made the horrors take a back seat to exploring the human condition. If im honest, once the movie was over it was less the scares and more the existential dread of life that stayed with me. Mia Goth and the rest of the cast was spectacular and cannot wait for the prequel! Well shot, well directed, acted, scored! This is a gem of a horror movie and i loved it!",2022-06-05

"Oh man this was fun! It's campy and corny, but in a sort of charming way that gives a shoutout to 70's horror. The characters aren't necessarily likable people but they're full of life and interesting so that all their endings feel earned.The film had awesome gore effects and didn't just rely on cheap scares, which is the best kind of horror for me. The aesthetic of the old-school transitions, soundtrack, and the over exaggerated sex scenes filmed on the sepia-tone camera were A+. I haven't seen anything from Ti West before, but I'm definitely interested in the prequel now. One f'd up god dang horror picture.",2022-09-06
"I had high expectations for X and it didn't fall flat whatsoever, it just kind of held itself above water.X is very simplistic, eerie, perfectly shot/edited, funny, naughty, and only kinda gory. There were probably 2 scenes where I was grossed out and horrified, otherwise the other kills are pretty tame. The villains in the movie are kind of interesting, they're easy to beat by a longshot, yet the victims never see anything coming.The downside of it, it kind of feels long. Not like its boring, but you get pulled one scene to the next feeling a bit on edge, and nothing wild really pops off until about half way in. Call me weird but I expected/wanted more gore, some scenes just cut away while others were just like meh.Overall I'd recommend it, its got a real charm to it, almost felt like a Tarantino vibe. But the outcome is slightly underwhelming, and it isn't quite explained. I'd like to see Ti West have another go at this kind of movie.",2022-03-23
"I have read many negative reviews about this flick, and they all are written with good reason. I will not mention or argue all the downs, because there are much better and detailed reviews about them.What's good about this movie? Why you should watch it?It is very apparent that people who made this, invested good time and effort in making. This is not your regular 5 - 6 star horror flick that you have already watched tens of similars. Acting, directing, writing, editing... All way above nowadays' average ""horror"" movie.Will it blow your mind away? No, it will not.This isn't the kind of a movie that promises more than what it can deliver, but the kind that delivers exactly what it promises. What you will think of the movie after watching it will mostly depend on your expectations. Expect less, the more satisfied you will be. Expect more, the more disappointed you will be.Proceed at your own risk.Totally recommended for the fans of the genre.",2022-05-30
Not sure why there are so many good reviews for this film. I was really looking forward to it after watching the trailer but the film has a completely different feel and pace to it. I don't mind slow burners but this was so slow it was boring. Very disappointed and I won't be watching it again.,2022-04-15
Black guy does raunchy adult film with white females. Then the director throws in violence to try and make it seem like horror. Just weird. No black woman involved which is not surprising considering the way this was written and directed. Not a good film to bring with a spouse or girlfriend.,2022-04-03
"The movie X is a 10 star horror movie. CInematography is beautiful and sickening when it needs to be, unsettling in all the right ways, while still sexually charged causing emotional disarray. Stellar soundtrack. Good acting. Also starring Kid Cudi and who doesn't want more of him in every possible creative medium. Not for younger kids. It's about porn stars making porn at the wroooong location. It's also a comedy. Come to think of it I think it's the best horror comedy I've ever seen because it doesn't lean more towards comedy but falls right in the middle and executes both ends of the spectrum beautifully.",2022-06-12
This film is a blend of the 1970s sexploitation storyline intertwined with creepy murders & M. Night Shyamalan's the Village.It is decent enough. This film within a film format is nothing new to a tried and used genre.The cast is distinctive enough. It follows the predictable idiotic route whereby the characters make silly decision one after another.It is no classic but it is watchable. The colour palate at which is shot is in keeping with the 1970s vibes.It may be sending out the unintentional message that older people in a redneck community may but be as innocent as they seem. That said the ending is satisfying enough.,2022-12-02
"Whatever you think this movie is, you're probably wrong. I know I was. After reading the synopsis I almost passed. Comic book horror movies don't appeal and in recent years that's all that gets pumped out of hollywood and toronto. This is quite a bit more elevated than most horror genre but if you enjoy cinema in general, you'll be sure to like this. Many of the scene shots are copied from other films especially the 70s. It's not a cheap production. It looks like they took their time to craft this and they don't disappoint. E.g. One scene, the dialogue turns to 'pscyho' and a couple of mins later is the classic shower/knife pose as one character is exited. Accidental? Don't think so. It's not exactly copying but it's hard to tell of it's an homage either. Maybe the director has past movies stuck in his head, or he deliberately uses the same techniques; either way, it's fun to watch.",2022-10-26
"I wanted to love this so bad. I love TCM and I absolutely loved the style and the vibe this movie had. I thought it was going to follow along with TCM since it started almost identically in story. It got weird, like too weird like I absolutely didn't want to watch the end of this movie, weird. I'm all for sexual undertones in horror but this made me cringe so hard and there wasn't enough horror to balance it.",2022-04-16

"I liked this film a lot. It was a very well made slasher with interesting characters, good build up, and a cool bloody finale. The work was pretty twisted but it was never shock or gore just for shock or gore sake there was a good story going on. The premise is that a younger group of people go to make an adult movie at the farm that belongs to two strange old folks who - when they learn what is going on - decide to start to kill the filmmakers. What follows is a pretty wild action packed bloodbath with a solid conclusion and some icky wild twists. If you like a good slow burn horror/slasher and have kind of a dark twisted sense of humor this film is perfect for you.",2022-12-21
"Walking the fine line between sex & violence, age & beauty and art & exploitation, X takes ideas & inspirations from several slasher films of the past to offer an old-school horror in a brand new package. Crafted with passion, told with flair & steered by a likeable cast, this original, gripping & consistently entertaining grindhouse delight gets ample thrills out of its simple setup and also ranks amongst the better films of the year.Written, produced, directed & edited by Ti West, the story concerns a group of young filmmakers who set out to make a porno in rural Texas during the 1970s only to fight for their lives after their elderly hosts find out. West is patient in setting things up and also allows ample time to acquaint the viewers with his characters before ratcheting things up and bringing out the vicious & violent goods while keeping the tension alive at all times.The camerawork echoes the techniques used in 70s slashers & porn with its grainy look & gritty, unrefined feel and there is playfulness evident in editing too. Also contributing to its exploitation flavours are the splatter gore effects & make-up wizardry rendering death & decay with finesse. As for the performances, Mia Goth, Jenna Ortega & Brittany Snow shine in their respective roles, with Goth impressing as not one but two different characters.Overall, X is a fascinating homage to the low-budget & full-bloodied slasher classics and it not only emulates their sleazy quality but also the edgy, creative spirit. Balancing terror & titillation and offering a funny, frightening & fiendish ride that scores good marks in almost every aspect, the film earns all the shocks & surprises it has in store and the old-fashioned craft on display is always pleasing to the eye. A welcome tribute & a thrilling genre offering.",2022-10-27

Director: Ti West
Starring: Mia Goth, Jenna Ortega, Brittany Snow, Kid Cudi, Martin Henderson, Owen Campbell, Stephen Ure, etc.In 1979, a group of young filmmakers set out to make an adult film in rural Texas, but when their reclusive, elderly hosts catch them in the act, the cast find themselves fighting for their lives. What a movie this was, such an amazing experience.The cinematography and editing was truly amazing each shot was so well constructed and thought out and it was visually stunning. The set design was fantastic. With fantastic performances. Particularly from Mia Goth, Jenna Ortega and Brittany Snow. The campy humour was great. With a great set up. The score for this was truly terrifying and added so much atmosphere. The film built tension incredibly well, I was incredibly tense throughout. The script was very well written. The directing from Ti West was excellent. The film had an incredibly uncomfortable tone, there was some seriously disturbing scenes.The themes were really interesting and executed with a lot of depth and clever insights. What it had to say about modern beauty standards, the porn industry and about the elderly wanting to remain youthful was fascinating. The characters were all interesting and charming. The gore and jumpscares were great with some gruesome kills. Plus the final act was incredibly intense and well done.My only slight criticism would be that there was some underwhelming deaths with the antagonists in the final act.Overall, X is a bold, artistic and deeply terrifying horror/slasher. It doesn't reinvent the genre but it doesn't need to when it follows the formula so well. This is how to do an effective horror. Ti West delivered an experience I won't be forgetting for some time.Overall Score: 96/100.",2022-04-16
"It might not be elevated, but like every A24 horror it sure is gentrified. Some of the attempts to suggest 70s rural horror are interesting on themselves, but it can't avoid remaining to clean and a lot of the stabs at exploitation commentary feels off. Making the wannabe director talk about how he plans to play with editing to setup the movie unsuccessful attempts to do the same is unfortunate. Overall, X wants to derive a lot of its tension from our shared understanding of its drama shape, but it's an idea more than something that feels dramatized, a lot because West fails on the payoff.The movie most hopes the proximity between adult and horror movies and the idea of approaching 80s moral panic will give it some power, but it rarely does (the exception is probably Ortega's crisis in the end, but that's too brief and West most botches the execution). Maybe it is just that unlike West I don't see low rent slasher Boogie Nights as much of a promising concept. The actors have fun with pastiche in both genres and some of the first hour do work on overall group dynamics.X goes back to the structure that first made West name with a very long build and violent payoff, but the latter is far less brief than in those earlier movies. I like House of the Devil and The Innkeepers, but they are far more effective in suggesting dread and anticipating violence than delivering thrills when it has to and X follows the same only it's not a 10 minute sequence. There's less dread in X than those early movies, but there's a revulsion towards the setting and as long as the movie is building up to violent release that keeps it interesting than the payoff starts, and things fall apart fast.West is an intriguing horror director, but a bad thriller one, he is in a way the ideal director for the last 15 years of genre festival approved horror in that he designs movies, but he can't quite do the same towards sequences. X has no modulation for is horror scenes, six people are in the same room, then they are scattered and fall prey to the old couple one by one (it is worth point out only a couple of them are even aware something is wrong until the end, which is far too few). The deaths are violent, but they staged in usually brief manner that play up the shock effect over staying power, it comes and goes, and the movie is fast back into the next victim. Like the movie is just rushing towards a checklist. West early better movies only had one relevant character and he must keep track of a large ensemble and he doesn't seem to quite manage to pull the same effects.The commentaries on aging and religion never works. The aging makeup as source of revulsion in particular falls flat and the preacher on TV just smug in way the satanic panic stuff in House of Devil didn't. That was effective as a commentary on conservative fantasies of its setting, X most offer current gentrified fantasies about what 70s rural horror had to say about American repression but doesn't seem to quite know how to access it beyond its more surface observations.",2023-01-30
"In 1979 an Adult film crew heads down to rural Texas to shoot a porn. Soon they arrive to a farm to film,Where an old couple that owns the farm is unaware of what they're actually doing. However there is far more going on with the farmer and his wife then just renting out a space. This is a film that in a way glorifies the era. It an old fashioned horror setting. While still creating a very beautiful film and well pace story. It's a film that takes it time and spends a lot of time with these people. They all actually a pretty funny and have personalities. So you get a real feel for these characters. To say that this movie is like Debbie does Dallas meets Texas Chainsaw isn't too far fetch. It's easily to always say that with it's very rural country setting. However the way the film is shot and edited as while as the cast gives this very grindhouse Tone. The film in many ways is suspenseful not much so as being terrified, but more so on edge when something might actually happen. When things do start it go crazy.

But the female of this elderly couple turns out to be a sexopath. Although the imdb rating of the film is close to 7, it is a film that will not have that score.

"I enjoy watching trailers for new movies. Whether it be for a film I've been looking forward to or a film I've never heard of. X was a movie I had never heard of. The first trailer for X made me fall in love. It reminded me of seventy horror movies, and I love seventies horror movies. I hoped the film would live up to my expectations. It lived up to the expectations and far succeeded them.I'm not really sure where to begin when talking about X. The film's seventies setting is perfectly portrayed. You really feel immersed in the late 70s; it's one of the reasons I was most excited about seeing this film. Ti West is the perfect director for this film. His vision and direction for this film make for an enhanced viewing experience. Neither of those things is the reason for my love of this film. I love this film primarily because of the performances of the main three actresses: Mia Goth, Jenna Ortega, and Brittany Snow. Snow is excellent as pornographic actress Bobby-Lynne. Jenna Ortega has built an impressive resume in horror this year alone (Scream, X, and playing Wednesday Adams). Ortega feels like she's now a mainstay in horror, and I look forward to seeing her in future movies. The best performance in the film belongs to Mia Goth.

"To all the time waster and money burning filmmakers out there get yourself together because this is how you make a movie. What an absolutely delightfully complex, shocking and funny piece of art, there are so many messages on so many levels, so many symbols, meta stuff and everything just hits. A smashing masterpiece. Love Mia Goth, what a genius of an actress.I did not expect any depth evolving in a slasher movie though or any complexity and very serious emotions but there they were. This is NOT an easy movie. Be prepared for the challenge on mental, physical and emotional levels too if you watch this.Ti West however i had a very difficult time to forgive you THAT bit and you know Ti what i mean. You're brilliant but i did call you ugly names after that part. Tee hee.",2023-02-03
"X can be seen as a nice throwback for 70's/80's slasher/gore/horror fans, but I honestly think even they will not fully enjoy this piece of garbage. Btw, there's a reason why movies like the 70's/80's aren't made anymore: they generally didn't have strong plots, and all that mattered was female nudity & gore. Times cahnged. Keep the f up. Most people want good stories, relatable characters & strong villains with strong reasons - none of which can be found in this movie.The movie is roughly one and a half hours long, and the first whole hour of it is nothing but a bunch of bums trying to shoot a porn ""movie"" in the hopes of becoming ""stars"". That whole hour served NOTHING to the film. Only the moments where opposite ideas about sexuality clashed were kind of... ""entertaining"".I stopped watching around the end of the first hour, because the ""antagonist"" did some kind of dance after their first kill, which reminded me too much of the dance the Joker did in the bathroom after his first kill. The dance, combined with all of the other elements of the film was so unnecessary and cringy. ""The acceptance and celebration of madness"" can be portrayed in a million different ways; and all that the antagonist wanted was some d*ck - not that big of a deal, you know. The story should've invested more into the background story of the antagonist to justify such an irrelevant scene.Unnecessary movie. Not entertaining in any way at all.",2023-01-08
The first hour and fifteen of the movie: nothing happens. It's not even close to those nostalgic slasher films of the 80's. Was expecting a completely different film. Kind of boring. Just okay.,2022-04-16
"Cute, very sexy (sexploitationny is an understatement, but nicely), but without imagination or creativity. The characters are not well defined, not even one of them. It has gore, but not enough there to satisfy a gore fan either. It's indeed pleasant to follow the characters, but there's no atmosphere creation, nothing to make you feel lured into a world you didn't suspect. The actors aren't bad, except maybe the elder people with this abominable, almost laughable make up. But you do want to know what happens, and you do get to the end of it. And it is, to an extent, entertaining. Yet, I was expecting more of a Ti West movie. One thing about the film though, it is well shot. You have some nice photography, you discover the surrounding through a door, for instance, at some point, from the darkness of the room to the dimly lit, vast exterior and the dependencies of the property. Nice! Very nice! If only the script was as creative as the shooting.",2022-06-05
"This film was a mixed bag for me. I did enjoy the actors performances, but the message it was trying to convey felt muddled. The complexity of female sexuality and how women can be empowered by that sexuality is a noticeable talking point of the film. However, it fails to fully figure out how to portray its antagonist in a convincing manner.",2022-04-27
"This could of bin epic if they change the killer they had the gear but no idea, wtf was my eyes watching... wasn't bad but definitely wasn't good.They could of done so much with this turning it to a 80 year old killer that just wanted sex was a joke. I love 80s horror and they did smash that vibe but the granny killer just killed the film off definitely the sec part with them.",2022-03-27
"For a movie so preachy about sex and how people view it and are afraid of it, this movie was super tame. It didn't have the guts to be the movie it said it was. It was essentially just an average slasher movie. Actually below average because none of the situations were actually scary because frail old people aren't scary. The few ""scares"" it produced were jump scares driven by emotionally manipulative music.",2022-03-26
"Halfway through Ti West's ""X,"" a ragtag gang of porno filmmakers, including high-minded director RJ (Owen Campbell) and his shy girlfriend/sound girl Lorraine (Jenna Ortega) face a challenge. An annoyed RJ tells Lorraine they're too far into the story. Adding her in would change their movie's whole direction. ""What about 'Psycho'?"" Lorraine asks, reminding RJ that Hitchcock's movie introduces a new set of protagonists halfway through. ""Psycho"" is horror, RJ says, and they're not making a horror film. They're making porn. Of course, our characters are about to learn they are part of a horror picture. They just happen to be living it, not making it. X, from arthouse distributor A24, is a slasher movie about what really horrifies us. Writer/director Ti West (The House of the Devil) is too intelligent and thoughtful a filmmaker to believe that conventional boogeymen top our list of fears. He knows that a youth-obsessed society is far more terrified not only of growing old, but of confronting the fact that the elderly may still possess some very inconvenient desires. Given all that, is the movie too highbrow for its genre? Does West's insistence on interrogating the relationship between cinema and youthful beauty compromise some of the suspense? Maybe a little bit. The middle act could be tighter. And the final ""twist"" bludgeons the viewer with its irony. It's an unnecessary reveal that is too on the nose compared to the subtlety of what's come before it. The film crew's ""let's-put-on-a-show"" ethos highlights the plucky, hard-fought joys of low-budget filmmaking, recalling movies like ""Ed Wood"" or ""Dolemite is My Name."" When the focus switches to out-and-out horror, the source of ""X's"" enthusiasm and devotion also changes. Instead of the characters being energized by the ad-hoc creative process, it's West himself who radiates excitement, nearly becoming an off-camera character as ""X"" gleefully picks off its filmmaker proxies one by one.",2022-10-31
"TI West directs, writes and edits this movie about a group of employees of a burlesque club, more than happy, to ditch their jobs to jump into a van and find a place to make a hardcore adult movie. It's the late 70's and this group finds a boarding home on remote property outside Houston, Texas to film their project. The property is owned by an elderly couple and should be easy to conceal what these friends are planning to do.Plans are to make a hardcore sex movie to sell in adult video stores. And this group is not prudish or uncomfortable about getting naked and performing various sex acts before a camera. But once the old property owner and his dementia-prone wife find out what is going on, the mellow couple become different shades of violent. A bloody, gory mess helps ensure an ""R"" rating.The cast includes: Mia Goth, Brittany Snow, Martin Henderson, Owen Campbell and Kid Cudi. A super soundtrack features Mungo Jerry, Robert Plant, Blue Oyster Cult and Brittany Snow.",2022-09-30
"I came across this movie after skipping about five to six movies in between being boring may be that's the reason I watched this entire movie because I did not find it boring. It's just a average slasher but I did not feel like switching off in between because I found it to be entertaining better than many other small budget big budget horror flicks, this was little different and time pass.well I won't recommend watching in theater spending money but on ott this is good compare to many other movies available on ott. It could have been more interesting with few more edge of the seat scenes and little fast pace.",2022-09-20
"This is the nicest horror in over a year. The old people are really nasty, yet you can not help but symphatize a bit top. The violent parts are really, really violent though. Acting is decent, and time period (late 70s) is nicely done. 8/10, defo recommended!",2022-03-21
"X is a surprisingly good time with successfully crossing multiple genres.

"I have no idea how - once again - one of these mindless slasher films (or in this case ""hillbilly killer"" films) made it on my watch-list. Usually I root those out while searching for horror films. I have a strict ""no-thrillers - only supernatural horrors"" rule, but every once in a while I get sloppy in my detective work and one of these crappolas ends up on my screen. The bad part is that by the time I realize this, the movie is already one-third over, so then I feel obliged to finish it, which is of course a monumental waste of time with practically all thrillers... With the usual risk of (even more) brain-damage.Though with the help of the fast-forward button, naturally. I pretty much skipped/skimmed through a third of the movie, all of it in the 2nd half. Once I realized that the idiotic premise involved murderers who were an ancient couple that looked like they'd escaped an Egyptian tomb, I lost all interest. That kind of stuff is geared toward different demographics, those who welcome brain-damage with open arms. It's not for me. Any time murderers are dumb-yet-uncatchable, or little children, or ancient couples, or farm animals, I try to avoid it. I have no time for such junk. One needs barely functioning grey cells to get into that kind of malarkey, which is why the thriller genre is the most peanut-brained film genre of them all.It's not all bad though. The first half-hour has positive things about it.The photography is good: because the plot takes place in the late 70s there are actual colors i.e. This isn't a stereotypical bleak-looking 21st-century grey-o-rama piece of junk.The set-up is OK: a crew of decadent buffoons go to shoot a po$$ographic film. Better still, they don't behave like utter clowns, at least not often, and they are not the usual teen cretins, but vary in age, though the women appear to be in their twenties. There is a sense of mystery in this section, which of course turns out to be just a ruse for the movie to eventually dive into stupid-slasher mode.Speaking of diving, there's an interesting scene with Mia in the lake, early on. The aerial camera angle works very well. She resembles the young Shelley Duvall, though I doubt anyone noticed.However, the old couple is just ridiculous, total overkill. Extreme make-up was used to make them look as if they were 250 years old, literally like Bowman in the final scenes of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Not only do they look too repulsive, they also lack realism, completely. It's ""Texas Chainsaw"" 1974 all over again but with far less style and mood.The premise of a murderous old couple isn't even that original: I came across it a few years ago in an even dumber UK film, in which the young people (burglars) get owned and killed by an old couple who look like they couldn't sit through a round of bingo much less kill and mutilate. And didn't M Night Charlatan also do a thriller about old killers on a farm recently? Hating on old people AND farmers at the same time: two despised, non-hip demographics swatted with one fell swoop. Perhaps it's a new genre invented by can$el-culture millennials who hate all generations older than Xers because they aren't PC enough for them? It's not as if I hadn't noticed that old movies barely get played on cable anymore, and by that I mean anything older than the 90s, which isn't even that old to begin with...Believe me, in just a decade nearly ALL films made before the 90s will be banned by these new kids, except those that deal with gay rights and ra$ial issues in an ""acceptably ko$her"" manner. Already now it's become very rare to come across movies from the 70s and 80s, let alone from the 40s or 50s. Wasn't ""Gone With the Wind"" banned in some U. S. states because some snowy flakes deemed it ""raci$t""?Soon all history will be ""erased"", newly re-written and all ""old non-progressive cultures"" will be swept under the rug, deemed too ""offensive"" and ""vile"" for the pre-Orwellian PC plankton. Perhaps these plankton will force everyone to shave their heads too, and burn DVDs in large bonfires, and then we'll have ""1984"" right in the middle of the 21st century.So yes, this might be a new thriller sub-genre, old people being evil serial-killers, despite the fact that such a premise is too daft on so many levels. You can only do a comedy based on this, not a thriller.The old woman fondling blondes adds even more unnecessary nastiness to an already decrepit story, and the big showdown has the usual nonsense. There are some good touches in the grand finale, but the conversations between Mia Goth (the very predictable generic ""heroine""/sole-survivor) and the old hag are beyond stupid, completely unrealistic and downright bizarre. Mia actually DEBATING with the murderer is laughable. Her character actually finds the time and interest to debate her future as an actress with these killers, amidst all the bloody chaos. Ti West, clearly, just doesn't give a damn. He fits this era hence like a glove.There's even a prequel to this nonsense, which nepotist Mia actually co-wrote so you can imagine how bad it must be. Would you trust a nepotist - who actually married Shia Lebouf - to write anything halfway clever or usable? Suddenly everyone's a writer and a director. Will she publish her thesis on Bigfoot next? Will her novels be studied in schools?There is a bigger chance that Rob Zombie usurps Kubrick as best director ever than Mia writing a usable script. There is a bigger chance of Rob Zombie solving the Middle East conflict than Mia co-writing a good movie.",2023-04-14
"On the lines of wrong turn type of movies with the same thriller movie plot where a group of people goes into a forest area where a few or no people live and then the group starts facing issues and gets stuck in the place losing the lives abducted by the heinous people in that forest, there's literally no change in the plot of al those generic films.And hence this film tries to bring in a change in that group of people's profession itself where they come in to make a porn film only and hence there's a lot of stuff for those who love watching porn stuff and its a good improvement that the writer has made this change because coincidentally people who watch these kinda film do so very specifically for watching the porn part of it and in that case, this film shines here.I didn't understand the concept of going back to the cowboy era for this flick.Overall, it is a good one-time watch for those porn addicts.",2022-10-17

"The marketing of this film combined with the fact that it was an A24 production had piqued my interest. On surface level it seemed like a movie with the whole porn film aspect as a voyeuristic hook that eventually turns into a shocking, unique horror film. It had the hook but the horror part was super average. Old woman envies young folks' youth and sexual vigor? Ok...so what? Very meh premise that I feel like the filmmakers were trying to present as shocking. Yes, when people age they physiologically still have a sex drive and can be frustrated by their limitations. That's not horrifying, that's normal. I guess it's the writer's nightmare?As for the horror/slasher aspect: when we get to the kills, it becomes very predictable. The kills were not shocking, they were just ok.Maybe I did myself a disservice by building this one up for myself but I genuinely thought it was going to have an ""X"" factor. It was shot well - I'll give it that, but that's not enough to make a good film. It just ended up being an average slasher masqueraded as elevated horror.",2022-04-22

"SPOILERS!!!!!I'm hardly 8m into this, and already I've had a few chuckles. It's pretty obvious (to me) who that preacher on TV is talking about; going to guess there's some foreshadowing regarding the blond and the alligator on the trailer from whence she emerges. Then, the question, ""What is your dream (blond)...?"" Cut to a black, uhm, rooster.That just had me roaring and had to start my review, in case I forget later.Later: Well...removal of some stars because there was a saying in the 60s and 70s about the Three Biggest Lies. It was truth then, and it is still true. Why Hollywood is trying to jam the rooster down our throats is a mystery but I remember ""something is beautiful"" being one of the three biggest lies. It was truth then, it's true now. Nuff said on that.I wonder, if the ""Congratulations. Now You're a Pig"" moment hadn't occurred with Church Mouse...would the events have folded out the way that they did...? (That line is from another 70s movie, SNFever where Tony says to that stupid Donna some similar sentence. That felt spot on for that entire nast-e-ness.)Anyway, Mia Goth is great as usual...she's adorable with the freckles.

"I was fortunate to see 'X' with little knowledge of what was going to be in store for me, barring the basic premise and its poster. It is a very difficult movie to review without posting spoilers, but suffice to say I was very impressed with this film. Many of its elements will be familiar to horror fans, but the way that 'X' has been put together demonstrates the filmmakers' delight in paying homage to the genre whilst subverting its audience's expectations. The cinematography was impressive throughout, convincingly rooting the film in it's 1979 time period, and backed up by an eerie and effective score. It's important to note that, in addition to its technically well-executed gorey setpieces, this film is not afraid to step into disturbing territory, therefore it's remarkable that the film isn't afraid to have a sense of fun. Some sequences are so subversive and shocking in their immediacy that you have to laugh, whilst moments earlier the tension can be palpable.I thoroughly enjoyed 'X,' and whilst I'm certain it won't be to everybody's horror tastes, I hope it gets the recognition it deserves. I'm definitely going to be eagerly awaiting its upcoming prequel, 'Pearl'.",2022-03-18
"Ti West's X kicks off in the year of 1979 following a group of young filmmakers out to make a name for themselves with their own dirty movie. After renting a farmhouse for their picture, the elderly couple who owns the farm become more and more suspicious and curious. Right off the bat, what this movie succeeds at is emulating the 70's Era, but also the eerie nature of the subject matter and niche genre, much in thanks to the cinematography and editing that is done in a way where it feels unnatural or off. The film also doesn't fail to deliver on the brutality and gore. The score is also memorable and unnerving as we further explore the setting of the film and who these farm owners really are. Performances, I can say, are good for the kind of movie that Ti West was hoping to deliver. I guess a con would be that X acts as a throwback to the past, so it doesn't really try to do anything outside of the box, but nonetheless, is a film that executes it well. Final verdict: 8/10.",2022-12-02
"Having heard strong praise from this film around its release but not being overly intrigued, had somewhat high expectations (given its high rotten tomatoes ratings, among others).It is a simple story yet messes two different genres in one and works quite well. Mia Goth shines as the lead, as well as Jenna Ortega (very bright future). They are easily the standouts. As for the film it is gory and has some jump scares as expected but overall very predictable. We get a sense of the creepy elderly couple from the first glance and seemingly know how things will play out. Surprised at how high it's critics ratings are as the film doesn't feel that special but simply above decent.",2022-06-25
"I thought I saw the last of West behind the lens in the horror genre, but lo and behold, he came back with a solid passage that not only pays homage to Tobe Hooper, without feeling forced, it also stays away from being derivative.If you've seen the trailer, you know the premise. Now sit back and let it unfold. His stylistic approach is evident right away with a tracking shot that is right out of the 70s and works it way backwards from there to the onset of the sleaze-slasher fest about to unfold. Nice grab by A24 and from what I've read, West has another, whether it's a sequel or in the vein of this on tap. Yes please.",2022-04-13

"A group of adult filmmakers set off for Texa to shoot the film. However, the players find themselves struggling to survive from an elderly person who is obsessed with them.X brings the feel of a 1970s-era film to its story plot. X brings on a classic horror feel. The plot of the classic story with a group of young men who must survive a deadly attack. However, this film appears different. The tempo of the film is so slow. Conflict is present and appears quickly at the end of the film and slow in establishing conflict at the beginning of the film. It's not good enough to see the development of the main character and everything else. Simple story plot. Building a flat story, there is not much of a well-constructed atmosphere. Flat dialogue, minimal expression, looks lethargic and weak. The terror and horror presented are less than satisfactory. It features the terror of two elderly people but made with an anti-climax that is not exciting and feels strange. I think this movie is 40% a blend of drama and horror, the rest is a movie full of sex scenes.",2023-01-07
"""X"" is at its heart a slasher film with a unique approach. Directed by Ti West, ""X"" follows a small production team that goes to rural Texas to shoot an adult film; in an attempt to capitalize on the growing home video system industry. They keep the nature of their visit a secret to the property owners and after a few nights, things get very weird and dangerous for all of them. It's not shy of the gore or violence, but that's also not the focus. Surprisingly much of the screen time is spent on the characters themselves which are refreshing and something I enjoyed. There are various scenes of pure suspense that are masterfully done, both making you uncomfortable and disgusted at times. The film is more interested in freaking you out than just showing you some kills and I applaud it for this, especially because the kills here aren't the ... greatest. It's a nitpick though. It can also be very erotic at times, which shouldn't be surprising to anyone. I never found it distasteful or unnecessary, everything serviced the plot well.It's violent, weird, gross, erotic, and unique. It's pretty awesome.",2022-03-25
"The gimmicks of classic slasher films are present in abundance though are morphed in various ways, which gives a feeling of authenticity and newness. The interplay between sex, innocence, virility, and death, a staple of the genre, is mutated and turned on its head, prompting viewers to question right and wrong in several dimensions--this is the hallmark of the film. Inventive editing adds to the overall horror, and there was even one sequence, or the way scenes were spliced together, that I had not experienced before. Cryptic hints to a backstory actually make sense. The female leads are tantalizing but also reprehensible. The scope and setting is fittingly small for the genre. Some kill scenes are brutal in a way that supersedes the source material, which contrasts well with the quirkiness of just about everything else in the movie.I call it an irreverent homage because it really is fashioned as a satire, but the satire is actually achieving the same things as the source material rather than just making fun of them. And there is an obvious respect of the slasher genre that shines through above all else.The main area for improvement is the lack of dread. There was no true stalker moment, which is the only thing missing.",2022-03-21

"Well well, look what we've got in here? Seems like Slasher movie fanciers will be having some great time and that's not just because of the sole constituents of blood & gore (though they had plentiful to showcase), but also for this palpable drama, the makers had managed to develop encircling this specific set of characters and their motives and moralities. The thing is, slashers generally, in most cases, don't get much material to work with (I mean, in terms of the narrative), unlike here, where the circumstances have quite been out of the ordinary!Not only the makers do pay tributes to good ol' vintage slashers but they also put in some additional efforts in putting together a storyline that is much more significant and pronounced (compared to its contemporaries). As can be observed through an array of parallels they had tried to draw in-between a couple of sequences (take that Christian Congregation clip for example).The selection of different track numbers and their respective placements were well thought of, I was truly impressed and I couldn't help but notice that they almost had a poetic essence to them! So did the all-around Cinematic treatment here, which is very reminiscent of the golden period of the '80s (as it should be anyway cause the story is set in 1979).Now if you want me to speak a few words about the performances; frankly speaking, there's not much to say other than the fact that Mia Goth is stunning and she indisputably steals the show (in both the roles; Maxine & Pearl).",2022-04-25

However, Goth steals the show with a surprise duel role as the players are picked off in true slasher style.The humanity even from the killers offers a fresh spin on the genre. With echos of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Psycho and subtle nods to other 70s horrors throughout; X feels fresh and original, thanks to West keen eye and smart writing.It's wonderfully directed with great camera work offering suspense and chills. X doesn't pull any punches, the gore effects, violence and alligator are well executed. The on location feel, makeup and production values adds credences to the setups. The sound track plus Tyler Bates and Chelsea Wolfe's music score adds to the groups plight, in contrast to the tension and chills.Overall, another outstanding rounded horror from West.",2022-10-10
"The casting and acting is incredible. Overall great style that matches the era. The editing was mostly great, except they did this thing though where they jump to another scene then back then to the new scene, it was really disorientating and janky. The music was again mostly great, there were just some really odd cues that sounded wrong. It's a very typical Ti West film, well made, full of style but sometimes slow. It's a straight film with no meta and no irony which I like! The story is a bit ropey, it feels like some core character decisions don't make any sense, especially with the old couple. Although mostly the character decisions felt natural. The jump scares are not well executed. Great sound design throughout. Great gore but possibly not enough of it, especially for a slasher film. One of the deaths with a pitchfork wasn't believable at all. The old people looked ridiculous, the makeup to make them look old doesn't work and the performances are completely wrong, they simply don't seem old at all. I hated the guitar and singing interlude, it served no purpose. It's an artistic film rather than an entertaining film, whilst it is entertaining it seems to put the art first. I didn't like the opening of the film, it ruined the ending a bit for me, could have done without that opening. The story was original and interesting. Very reminiscent of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974).",2022-12-18
This horror movie is like no ever it's just so good and Cudi is absolutely fantastic he really shows how good at acting he is the whole film is amazing it's very disturbing but 🤷‍♂️That's where the 18 plus rating comes in very violent very sexual very awesome if you ask me !,2022-03-18
"An ambitious producer Wayne (Martin Henderson) sets out from Houston for rural Texas with a group of youngsters to make a porn. Maxine (Mia Goth), girlfriend of the devorced 40 year old producer, is the central figure of the movie. Desperately seeking fame and wealth she is convinced starring in porn movie would bring her the fortune. Bobby-Lynne (Brittany Snow) is open minded and experienced porn star while her partner Jackson (Kid Cudi, famous rapper) is endowed Vietnam vet who found his vocation in the industry. RJ (Owen Campbell) is responsible for shooting the whole scene. Last but not least, his conservatively raised girlfriend Lorraine (Jenna Ortega) helps during the shooting. They hire old wooden cabin from senior couple Howard (Stephen Ure) and Pearl (also played by Mia Goth). They are unaware of their intention so the tension soon begins to rise.I find this movie quite entertaining. Ti Wests' achievement will surely keep your eyes on screen for whole 105 minutes. It is not typical representative of the horror genre. Some will find the lack of true horror scenes. There are no stupid jump scares and spilling barrels of blood, instead rural Texas provides chilling atmosphere with strange elderly couple in the centre of it. The first half of the movie primarily focuses on the arrival at the countryside and making the porn. But in the second half the show really kicks in. Ruthlessness and simplicity are leitmotives of this horror flick. Killing scenes are portraited vividly, almost grotesque. Just like I wanted, nothing exaggerated. It carries the spirit of the good old slashers!All praise for the writer (also Ti West) for combining the theme with horror scenes. It pictures transience of good-looking. Interestingly, half of the audience in cinema found naked old bodies the scariest part of the movie. I didn't recognise Mia Goth playing Pearl, the old woman, at all. When you look at it, it's interesing how people change, at least physically. If asked, Pearl would surely join the young crew in shooting. But that free and wild behaviour just don't suit her anymore. Use your youth well, just like Lorraine! I guess that's the message. If you won't do it when you are young, you surely won't do it when you are old, sick and a ""little"" less handsome. Even if that means shooting porn in rural Texas with Vietnam vet you never met before. If you feel like you want it - just go for it!Whole-hearted recommendation to all, whether you are a fan of horror or not. Where The Texas Chain Saw Massacre meets Friday the 13th, you sure don't want to miss it.",2022-05-03
"I was very pleasantly surprised by X. It's a nice throwback to the slashers of old but it's made with much more care and quality than most of those movies. X only starts going as a slasher an hour into it and I did not mind at all. The first hour is sort of a hang out movie with dark undertones and the thing is, it works very well. If it continued down this path I would've been completely fine with that but the carnage was just an addition to everything that preceded it. The kills were very good and the tension was there because I didn't want any of the characters to die. The pitfall of most slashers or maybe a feature is that the characters are bland/annoying to a point where you are rooting for the killer to murder them. In X the characters are well-established, well-acted and most of all believable. On top of that, the late 70s atmosphere really adds to it and the music choices are great. Additionally, the cinematography is pretty great. It looks almost like it was shot on film despite being shot on digital. In the end the film is still limited by its genre and tropes and you know where it's going to go but as en example of said genre it's definitely above most of them.",2023-03-16
"An endless sequences of gore, violence, porn, and action but with a fun twist. Good actors and movie. Very fun and wonderful script and story. Good photography, locations, scenaries, and a good time spends really well, also of my money.",2022-06-17
"This movie, from the twisted genius of Ti West, recently witnessed the release of its prequel ""Pearl"". Since ""X"" released earlier, horror-movie fans received a stunning introduction to a surprising new face in the slasher genre. With ""Pearl"", which came after, they got an origin story that was just as shocking and twisted. I suggest you watch them back to back for optimum entertainment value. In ""X"", new characters returned to Pearl's old farm where fresh bloody mayhem soon unfolded.Ti West did amazing work writing and directing this one. Tyler Bates and Chelsea Wolfe did superb work scoring this project. Malgosia Turzanska's costume design was aces. Great work all round by the editing, hair-makeup, art direction, VFX, and set decoration teams. Special shout-out to the stunts team and Eliot Rockett's cinematography. Tom Hammock's production design was top notch.Mia Goth technically did not reprise her role as Pearl, but played a random girl named Maxine. The way Mia approached this character was curious and compelling. She gave Maxine an aura of desperate ambition and vulnerability but also the simmering threat of violence. Her performance was complex and flawless. It was also evocative of what she did in ""Pearl"".Jenna Ortega as Lorraine was superb. She wonderfully balanced intrigue and intrepid curiosity through her character. Brittany Snow as Bobby-Lynne was quite good. Jackson, played by Kid Cudi, was great. Wayne, played by Martin Henderson, was noteworthy. RJ, played by Owen Campbell, was captivating. Sherriff Dentler, played by James Gaylyn, was good. The televangelist, played by Simon Prast, was also good. Howard, played by Stephen Ure, was great.All other crew and cast did notable work in ""X"" now streaming on Amazon Prime Video.The year was 1979 in ""X"" as opposed to 1918 in ""Pearl"" - both movies released in 2022. Despite the time gap, Pearl was still very much alive on the same farm, where she lived with her husband. After watching what happened in the prequel, it was interesting to note that her husband hadn't turned her in but seemed to have made peace with his wife's inner demons.Ti West made sure to include essential flashbacks and other sequences to establish the plot's nuances, especially how it connected with the storyline in ""Pearl"". Even the crocodile was still around. Mia's double-acting as old Pearl was superb, to say the least. Such outstanding hair-makeup transformation.This movie was certifiably grotesque. It also had raunchier and smuttier scenes than ""Pearl"", but there was method to the pornographic madness.In ""X"", we saw a bunch of young filmmakers unwittingly heading over to the same isolated farmstead in rural Texas where Pearl lived. Some nice contrast-shots with Maxine who was living what she felt was her dream at the start of the 80s.The kids were eager to get started on their adult-film enterprise. But one thing led to another and they were caught in the act. Pearl was not particularly bothered, but when neither Howard nor anyone else was willing to make her 'feel good' again, she took offense.Things soon became a game of bloody survival for the kids who realized that the strange old woman who usually kept to herself was now out for blood. Howard, on the other hand, didn't like people enticing his wife even though he could no longer satisfy her, and that only added fuel to the proverbial fire.But Mia Goth's Maxine was not going to take things lying down. Something visceral, even primal, was soon unleashed from within her as she did what was needed to survive. Maxine gave an almost karmic performance that will unnerve fans of this budding franchise.Nevermind typical slasher tropes. The consistency with which Ti West captured Pearl's inability to keep from killing what she assumed was a threat to her dignity and right to have what she wanted (when she wanted it) made ""X"" a nuanced horror movie sequel that was eerie, creepy, grotesque, and discomfiting.",2022-11-05
"Ti West directed movie X is very scary and thought provoking.The story is set in a remote part of Texas where a group of three young couples want to make a good sex movie in a house rented by old couple.Martin Hendersen ( well know from Grey's Anatomy and Virgin river)is very likeable as aggressive producer of movie . Wayne and ambitious girlfriend Maxine(Mia Goth) make a nice pair .Brittany Snow (from Pitch Perfect) as Bobby-lynne , a blonde , bold star and her ""sometimes"" boyfriend Jackson (Kid Cudi from Don't look up) are very convincing as two independent adults. Jenna Ortega as Lorraine starts off as helper for cameraman RJ (played by Own Campbell) and is really fascinated by sex scenes and now wants to join acting crew in the movie.The whole premise of the movie is very interesting. Elderly couple Howard ( exellent Stephen Ure from LOTR) and his wife Pearl (Mia Goth makeup is great) are very scary and their presence is creepy.Makes old age , already filled with beauty and health related problems now to be viewed as sexless and frustration packed years of life.Excellent Direction by Ti West.1hr45m. Excellent edition.",2022-10-04
"A horror movie by any other name. X! Yes, it's your typical horror movie set at farm, barn or cabin. But let's attract a little attention by making the subplot the filming of an X - Rated movie!An old fashioned horror flick. Decent amount of Gore, not for the light of heart mind you, the movie starts off slow But picks up the pace midway through with Suspense and Gore alike.Here's the problem I have with the otherwise enjoyable movie. Apparently, the director and actors have never seen a Pornographic movie (Not that I have) and this is where they get it all wrong. The acting while filming the pornographic scenes is just too good to be believable.",2023-02-25
"""X exploits our natural disposition towards those who are long in the tooth, you let your guard down and even in confrontation, you dare not to be physically defensive lest you might break their fragile bones. But corporeal fragility doesn't mean that they cannot be deadly wicked, mind you, bad people also grow old. Here the WWII veteran Howard (Ure) and his wife Pearl (Goth) are psychopaths down to the ground, their killing spree involves the usual bloody business of multiple stabbings, head-chopping, eye sockets-impaling, fingers-hacking, shotgun blasts and a supposedly gator attack in the night, which is too dark to see anything, a nice economical ploy.""read my full review on my blog: Cinema Omnivore, thanks.",2022-05-05
"Poorly shot and edited. Whenever it felt like something should happen with the film crew, they cut away. Awful subplot takes half of the movie and is not disgusting or horrifying, just stupid.5/10 means I would never watch this again.",2022-04-03
X is well shot and perfectly captures the time period that it's set in. It's a wild experience with that manages to be thrilling and horrifying while still finding the humor.,2022-05-12
"While I know there is a prequel to this, I am judging this as it stands alone. This was by no means a bad movie, but it was quite predictable, slow paced and there is a lot left unexplained... leaving you a little unfulfilled, slightly confused and wanting more by the end.The acting across the board was quite good. It was also shot and edited beautifully. It really gave you that authentic 70s feel while also feeling modern. It was suspenseful at times, had some solidly creepy moments, and while it did rely a bit on jump scares I think it did it's job as a horror film.As I said, it was a tad slow and at times and I very much felt ""okay let's get on with it"". It was an interesting choice to have the main girl also play Pearl, but all in all I felt it a tad distracting as it wasn't the most convincing. My biggest issue with this was the plot, or lack there of. There was seemingly no explanation as to why any of this was happening, why there were doing this, what was up with the basement, or why she was special/ what they were going to do with her. Again, it left you feeling unfulfilled and a little confused.Overall I'd say this one was undeniably entertaining, but not without its flaws. I'd assume there is more to be learned in the prequel, but as a stand alone it fell a tad short. Would still recommend.",2022-10-28
"I came for Jenna Ortega but Mia Goth stole the show. 'X' is a must see theater experience especially if you're a horror/slasher buff. It's a chilling, stylish, slasher with beautifully haunting visuals which pay good homage to 70s filmmaking. There's a consistent sense of dread and suspense throughout the film which will definitely follow you when you leave the theater. Lastly, the gore is up there for you gorefest folks. Make sure to stay after the end credits for a sneak peek for the prequel, Pearl.",2022-03-23
"This movie is entertaining but thin on the ground. I was much more interested in the soft porn aspects than anything else and the scariest part was witnessing each of the girls mount the massively hung black dude. It was shocking in that respect, knowing that young and innocent Jenna Ortega would be taking her turn next, and I did appreciate the tongue-in-cheek bravado of it all, but it's not a horror movie, more like a porn-slash-comedy with nasty bits in between.If you want to see a real sex-based horror movie that will shock you to the core, I recommend A Serbian Film! Rather, I don't recommend it, in fact, stay away, it's way too much for most viewers.I enjoyed X to a point, but for all the wrong reasons I think. I wasn't scared, just randy at the end instead.",2023-02-07
"I am a horror movie fan and I have seen lots of good slasher horror movies. By watching trailer of this movie and IMDB reviews and rating I decided to watch this movie. From beginning of movie, I felt like something amazing is going to happen but it's not the case. Direction is weak as compared to other similar movies. As their story is from 1979, they have decided to shoot this movie in those era type colors. Hence, cinematography is also not impressive. No shock or horror moments in this movie. The story is kind of weird. Moto of main villain is weird. The sex scene of old couple is really weird. How these old people are able to kill all these other people? That is really strange. Lots of unanswered questions are there in this movie which are not explained well. Nudity is also not impressive (if you are planning to watch for the same). Overall, you can skip this movie.",2022-10-26
"Has to be one of the slowest ""slasher"" films i have ever had the misfortune to watch and i love slow burn movies.The story itself is boring and uninteresting whilst making little to no sense due to a real lack of motive.There isn't a single likeable character in the entire film and I'm not sure if this was written by design or just a bad script.Prosthetic makeup of the ""bad guys"" was pretty poor as well which really detracted from the entire film.The saving grace of the film is the cinematography and practical gore effects which were pretty top notch and the costume department pretty much nailed the time period and setting. I really would not recommend this film to anyone though as it has very little to offer.",2023-08-05
"I genuinely found this film so boring, nothing new to the genre and overall very predictable. Also awful special fx used for the old woman. Just about every kill was predictable in this movie and a bunch of unanswered questions.. it's not all that. I couldn't buy the old sickly woman who can barely walk being a serial killer thing. And the fact I could tell it was a young woman with makeup on took me out of it completely. Visually it was great but the sickly old people killing young people was too much BS. Besides the gun kills of course. As a horror movie fan though this failed on every single level. Every single kill was telegraphed a mile away, usually with a Chekhov's gun. There was like 0 tension, just creepiness which came purely from a good makeup job, not acting. Mia Goth as Pearl was not it. It just felt like a waste of my time.",2022-05-17

"This movie turned so much better that I thought it would... I loved the acting and chemistry. The camera work was unbelievably good. The difference shots blew me away... Absolutely beautiful, Especially the alligator scene was timed or edited perfectly. The sex scenes were hot and not over done. Great story line, The old lady was different then what I could have imagined. The pace was spot on, and the build up of the characters worked well. I actually cared for them. The horror movie was very different from most horror movies. Well filmed, Good actors, Congratulations on a well done horror movie. Thank you!",2022-09-21
"Well, this was a little different, and then again, we've seen it all before.What's good here is that the film looks very interesting and hits the 70's look quite well. The plot is simple, a few people come to make an adult film on a secluded farm where an elderly couple lives. Things, of course, go wrong.The film is very well directed, and considering this is not a big budget film, the special effects look pretty good. There are a lot of practical effects, and practical effects, when done well, always look better than CGI.The acting is good, and the film is minimalist and achieves the atmosphere precisely with tension and good direction. The music is good and in almost every scene we have at least a little background music that emphasizes some things or simply gives an additional atmosphere to the film and makes it fuller.The mask and costume design are very good, and the film itself is obviously a tribute to grindhouse films from the 70s. The violence in the film is grotesque and excessive, but that's exactly what befits this type of film.The film is simple and relies on the atmosphere, the tension between the characters and the ominous atmosphere. The tension builds slowly with little hints and tiny indications that things will not end well for everyone.Quite an interesting and tense film, with grotesque violence, good costuming and solid acting.",2023-03-30
"There are so many things they could have done to take this premise and make it good. But, it is a bad horror movie which is A24 trademark by now.You see the bodies in the first few minutes and then you meet the characters one day before.Starting with the killers, there is no twist. The moment you see the creepy couple, you know what is going to happen and it happens. If someone else turned to have done it, that would have instantly made the movie much better.I hoped with cast that Jenna Ortega would be the final girl given her history but it was actually saved for the worst played character in the movie. Mia Goth was either doing some very bad acting or she didn't want to be in the movie at all.She also played Pearl but like why. She was not able to do one role properly and they gave her two. It wasn't a big reveal or related to the plot in anyway. They were hoping for awards, I guess.Also, what's with that single crocodile in that huge lake that comes to feed only when plot requires?",2022-05-04
"The movie takes place in 1979 in rural Texas. A group of young people set out to make an adult film in peace and quiet, so they rent a guest house from an elderly couple. The old man greets them welcome with a shotgun, and I thought that this old man might be dangerous. The movie slowly builds up the suspense, and in the meantime we get to see a porno being made. The most interesting thing about this movie, and maybe also the most stupid thing, is who the real danger turn out to be, which is the old lady host and not the old man with the shotgun. She is not just a dangerous killer either, she is very horny as well.The killings itself was not very creative, and most of the characters died in stupid ways. I would have liked a bit more gore also. The environment and the atmosphere was great though. The story was okey, and so was the characters. There was not a single character that I disliked, which is unusual.I had high expectations for this movie, maybe too high, but overall it was a good movie.",2023-01-11
"""X"" is a good blend of a 70s slasher movie and the exploration of more contemporary themes and dialogue. Sex in horror movies is not new but the way it's utilized here is particularly interesting to me, along with the ""movie within a movie"" narrative. The cast also did a good job with their acting and the humor was decent as well. There were a few editing aspects I wasn't a fan of, but overall an enjoyable gory horror flick that's pretty fresh!",2022-08-10
"The Good: If you're a fan of the 1970s, specifically horror classics like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Last House on the Left, this movie is for you. It's so flawlessly stylized and really takes you back to the era. While I have problems with the length, as a sucker for period pieces, I had no problem soaking in the atmosphere this film presents. Everything from the film grading to the costumes to the editing works so well to imitate films from the era.While I do think the film is unjustifiably long, it does a good job of setting up the creepy, unnerving atmosphere. The kills in this movie are brutal (and sometimes hilarious) but happen in such a way wherein they feel possible. There's a humanity to what happens in this film that I found legitimately terrifying. I also liked how grounded and straightforward this movie is too; it really feels like a low budget exploitation film from the era.Mia Goth is, as usual, fantastic, and she gets to shine as two characters. The transformation is unreal. While campy, I also thought Brittany Snow, Kid Cudi, and Stephen Ure were standouts as well.Another thing that I think this movie captures well is...well, sex. It's a movie where porn is a major element, so it's good that this movie doesn't shy away from that. There is a lot of T&A in this movie, some of it quite unexpected.The Bad: This movie is way too long for what it's trying to do. It's an extremely straightforward film and just sort of drags at points for no reason. I get that there's an element of atmosphere, but there's a good 10-15 minutes in the beginning that could have been spent better.I also think as appreciative as I am about the tone and setting, it does lean a bit too heavy into its homage to the 1970s. The film sort of lives and dies on how much you like the era, which could definitely be alienating.The Ugly: I found X to be more disturbing that a lot of other horror movies, because it's grounded in understandable motivations. There's a real humanity to what happens in this film that I just found...really compelling. Definitely watch this one if you're a horror fan, and I'd even recommend getting some friends together. If their tolerance for uncomfortable sex scenes and gore is high. Just a heads up.",2022-06-20
"Ok folks here are spoilersStarting nowOooooh! Old people are scary and gross! Especially old people out in the countryside, who watch televangelists and have become antisocial in their isolation... right? I guess?? Was that what Ti West was trying to say with this film? I don't exactly know.The first 30 minutes are borrowing so hard from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (original) it made me wish I was watching that again instead. Actually, the whole plot is, but I digress. I kept expecting there to be more to it than just ""Oh scary old people!"" but no, it just continued to hammer on that point, and then I realized that was what the entire film is.There's no crazy unexpected twist or anything. Nobody from p0rno group is in on this scheme, there are no twists and turns, all of the characters are actually just as shallow as they were initially presented, which was pretty disappointing.The only interesting character was the one Jenna Ortega played (maybe bc it's the only one that went through any kind of change), and then she just gets f!cking shot and that's it. Ok then.Looking at the marketing and the posters, I kept thinking that the film was about Pearl and her boyfriend snapping and killing all actors or something like that, but it wasn't. I wish that was what the film actually was instead, because that would have been a lot more interesting.I'm curious to see what Ti West does next, but this could've been much better.",2022-10-08
"I one hundred percent agree with the last line of this movie! Very good horror film! It starts out pretty basically, a group of 6 goes to a country farm to film a pornographic movie. But the elderly couple that own that farm have different plans. Very, very creepy duo, especially the wife. She totally freaked me out, especially in that bed scene! The film is gruesome at times, especially during the ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" scene! And I loved the way the ""Landslide"" scene is put together! I must have said, ""Oh hell no!"" about three times during this movie. I think this one is gonna sit with me for a while...",2022-10-06
I truly did enjoy this movie and the stacked cast too. It's such an amazing movie and brings me older horror nostalgia instead of doing the same old horror flick. This movie did something different and I loved it from the start to finish. I think this is a totally different approach to horror and I believe it succeeded quite a lot. There was so many amazing scenes and visuals throughout too and I'm highly recommending this movie for all. The kills are also so scary too and I believe this was overall just a great horror flick that did something different and it successfully made me fall in love with this movie.,2022-11-27
"It follows the typical horror movie plot, young attractive people are away from civilization and crazy people start to mess with them. There's obviously a few sex scenes, one of which I could've done without lol I wouldn't say there was one creative death scene, kinda meh in that regard. The reveal that Mia Goth's character was the televangelist's daughter left me going over a few scenes and her dialogue again. Overall an entertaining film but nothing jumped out as spectacular.",2022-03-19
"The star of a quick-fix porn-movie production finds the elderly hosts at the location a bit too jealous.Very promising opening shot, which uses a subtle change of frame to transform the scene completely and lay out various clues. Following that I expected an intelligent take on the movie making process and how we perceive reality, but none of it came through, as if the cinematographer and screenwriter were operating on different planes. Of all the potential themes, the only ones fleshed out are the moralizing about sex and love and the enduring nature of passion, delivered in two uninteresting dialogue scenes. And the stuff I was looking forward to enjoys a few strokes when the filmed events are interwoven with the real events, but at the very end just gets tossed off in a one-liner.The style and energy are good, performances all fine, the editing energized with several Scorsese-style needle-drops, and the score is nice and subtle. The story is by the numbers, but fatally undermined by the situation of the villains, which I couldn't help but contrast to Texas Chainsaw - no comparison at all. Plus the timing is just off on several of the frights.Overall: even my review ran out of puff.",2022-04-20
I loved it! It is a great throwback style set in the 70s with a porn horror storyline. This movie is an updated version of the type of movies we gen Xers grew up with. Sexy and scary. I loved it! Don't let the kids watch though. Not appropriate for them.,2022-04-16
"I loved this movie, and thought it was awesome! It had a really nice old school 70s feel, and the featured music was also a very nice touch.The casting was especially good in my opinion. The ""movie crew"" actors were all really great picks, and the makeup/clothes made it feel like these people were pulled straight out of 1979. The hairstyles were well done too.I was surprised at how good this was, as I was just cruising Amazon Video and noticed it. The decent IMDB rating compelled me to watch it.All in all I rate it as an excellent horror. It was also nice to see some more nudity beyond the typical slasher productions we see lately.",2022-11-01
"I think Ti West likes to select a bunch of flavors he knows are generally liked by horror fans and toss them together without creating an actual recipe. I never feel immersed in the universe he's creating, and while I can enjoy certain aspects of his movies, I find them pretty dull and off the mark.... Case in point, why did he think this was an interesting story? The theme feels half-baked at best.And once again, like so many movies today, the line between homage and plain stolen is really blurry. I'm not a big Rob Zombie fan but I will say the soundtrack for Devil's Rejects worked so well and felt authentic because he chose mostly b-sides and lesser known hits with a lot of soul. This score felt corny. It's hard to not compare the two at least a little as they're both (obviously) heavily influenced by Texas Chainsaw Massacre.The humor also kinda fell flat for me. I absorbed the jokes like you absorb scenery looking out the window of the bus. Just didn't work for me.",2022-07-28
"Had a blast watching this film. The classic slasher vibes paired with beautiful cinematography and a great musical score made this film the best horror film I've seen in a while. The music was hauntingly beautiful and well crafted to include vocal sounds to make the film feel more real. Not only a fun time, but a great cinematic experience as well.",2022-03-18
"These days, it's normal to have horror movies without any inspiration, a bunch of kids in an unknown place, getting killed one at a time, without any empathy on our part. After the 80s and 90s ended up sucking the slasher horror, since then, most movies were of questionable quality, having dumb characters and stupid attitudes, making us root for everyone's death.2022's ""X"" does exactly what they've all tried, a slasher horror movie with excellent characters, with everyone having a brain and knowing how to use them. A great tribute to movies like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween"", for example. However, it's not a copy, it just inspires and honors, showing director Ti West's love for the genre and these macabre stories.In addition, the film has substance, with various symbolism and analogies with religion and morality, for example. For those who love horror, this movie is a full plate! Containing many tricks to break our expectations, dodging our customs with the clichés of this type of production, making that from the first scene, we already remain attentive to everything during the film.But, don't think that X is based only on homage or symbolism, it is excellent in its own right! It has an excellent text, with great characters, impeccable performances, incredible and realistic production design and inventive and masterful direction! In short, it's a slasher out of the box, a brilliant film! I really liked it!",2022-04-14
"Only just above average. Around 59 minutes before any gore happens, the old lady is a bit scary, reminds me of one of my neighbours. Having said that, Mia Goth doubles up as the crazy old lady (Pearl) and does a good job of it.They certainly captured the cheesy porno theme in the first hour. That aside, the movie could have been better paced as it felt a little drawn out and lost some of the tension. Overall, I would recommend it.",2022-04-16
"Ti West's X is a film that harkens back to earlier 70's horror, but does it with style and scope that makes it look fantastic.Writer-director Ti West references many many things from Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic The Texas ChainSaw Massacre, and even though the last sequel to Texas chainsaw was released in February this year, it's amazing how fresh X is.Basically being the same story told a bit different and with a different reason for the group to be out in the sticks, X tells a compelling and gorgeously shot story.The style is carefully used to build the dread showing the audience the dangers that are abound, while the main cast believe they're safe and sound on porn set called The Farmer's Daughters.This film sets a nice pace, with a slow build up that pulls you into a sense of security and then it gets faster once the kills start happening. We see the majority of the porn film being shot, and then all hell breaks loose.",2022-10-21
"X, is directed by Ti West, a notable horror director coming from films such as, The Inkeepers, and The House of The Devil.It's a good horror film, but is by no means extending its reach to new heights in the genre. There's a lot of build here up to the climax, and it has some pretty awesome scenes that pay homage to classic slashers and 70's styled horror films.I couldn't really enjoy the plot itself however, but I found the characters fairly intriguing with some okay writing and script, and the antagonist of the film was more bizarre than anything but it made for a unique change of pace for your average titular villain.I would definitely recommend a viewing, but I wouldn't go in thinking it's the MOAB of all slashers or horror films in general, but it's a great throwback to the golden days of those times.",2022-04-19
"Better than this year's Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Mia goth delivers outstanding performance. A bit gory and blurry, but its fine, Inventive editing adds to the overall horror, creepy at first, but goes well enough till the end. The pace might be a little lethargic for some, but it delivers with it's bloody last act.",2022-04-14
"Saw this the other night and had a blast, the build up to the blood fest at the end was very satisfying and the way this was filmed felt like you were watching it in the 70's . Id say this was a nice throwback to 80's slasher films , felt like a mix between Texas chainsaw massacre and friday the 13th. BRAVO!",2022-03-21
"Taking place in Texas, 1979, where a group of young people (Mia Goth, Jenna Ortega, Brittany Snow, Kid Cudi, Martin Henderson) plan to shoot an adult film, hoping it'll propel them into stardom. They rent out a property from an elderly couple: Howard (Stephen Ure) and his wife Pearl (Mia Goth), living in an isolated farm and carrying out domineering surveillance. However, the couple eventually catches on to what they're making and the team finds themselves in a vicious fight for their survival. As the day shifts to night, the visitors slowly realize that they are not safe, and are being targeted by a nearby enemy. An X-traordinary Origin Story !. The X-traordinary Origin Story. Dying to Show You a Good Time!. One God Damn Up Horror Picture !.This thrilling and disturbing picture displays mystery, suspense, restless terror including decent scares with tense horror sequences full of gory set pieces. It's a Mia Goth recital in a double role as Maxine / Pearl, including loads of violence, gore, guts and blood. ¨X¨and its prequel ¨Pearl¨ are two nice and twisted terror movies. This ""X"" forms an inseparable diptych with the prequel ""Pearl"", both creating two decent stories that are strongly intertwined, in such a way that one complements the other. Ti West directs this unsettling, colorful film ¨X¨ and the macabre prequel ¨Pearl¨ that got big hit, ¨X¨ was set in1979, in which a group of young filmmakers set out to make an adult film in rural Texas, but when their reclusive, elderly hosts catch them in the act, the cast find themselves fighting for their lives; while ¨Pearl¨ was set in WWI, during the Spanish flu, both produced by 'A24', it is the most recient, prolific and influential American studio with films like ¨Hereditary¨, ¨Ex Machina¨, ¨Lady Bird¨or ¨¨Minari¨. In ¨X¨ shows young Maxine/Mia Goth as a teenage girl obsessed with one day becoming a star, however, these aspirations clash with her real life, she also performs an elderly woman and in ¨Pearl¨ set many years ago, in which Mia Goth returns to play the character of Pearl as a teenager, dealing with a deranged girl suffering of loneliness at a farm, whereas she doesn't know which reality is the real one, the actress removes the layers of makeup from the original movie in order to show Pearl's disturbing youth. ¨X¨explored the arrival of the new independent cinema in the seventies, while ¨Pearl¨ set in 1918 (61 years before the story of ""X"") reflecting the style of the golden age of classic cinema, mixing the tone of Douglas Sirk's melodrama with the Technicolor of Mary Poppins in a kind of 'demented' children's film.Director Ti West usually uses focus on the faces and bodies of our protagonists to show the despair and terrible happenings, adding brilliant cinematography by cameraman Eliot Rockett, suspenseful musical score by Tyler Bates and eliptical edition. The film could be described as anything but figurative immersion into the meanderings of the starring's pathological psyche. The motion picture was well directed by Ti West. He is a notorious writer and director known for ""Pearl"" (2022), ""X"" (2022) and ""The Innkeepers"" (2011). And also directed ""Cabin fever 2: The spring fever"" (2009) but after extensive re-editing and re-shooting of by the producers of this film, West requested to have his name removed from the movie and replaced with the popular pseudonym Alan Smithee; since he was not a member of the DGA his request was denied by the producers and he remains credited as the film's director. West has since disowned the final product claiming that it is more a product of the producers and executives than that of his own, it is unknown if there will ever be a ""directors cut"" released featuring West's original vision. ¨X¨rating: 6/10. The flick will appeal terror genre enthusiasts and Mia Goth fans.",2023-09-26
I've read a few reviews before going to my local theater. We were 3 in the theater as it is not for kids. And wow. I really had a good time. That's 70-80s slasher feeling. A very good hommage to Tobe Hopper and John Carpenter's 70s films. All the actors are fun and it show on screen. But Mia Goth here doing old/youth is probably what shines the most on screen. I did know her but she does not look like her other roles here. She is a legit badass. But also pure and beautiful and she knows it and her acting is really good for her parts. Kid Cudi had me cracking. He was so natural. Brittany Snow is as usual very fun and entertaining. I just discovered Jenna Ortega in the new Scream movie. She is very cool. Martin Henderson who look like in his best shape of his life and he is 47!!! This is amazing. All the cast do a good job. Ti West that I discovered with « The house of the devil » is doing his best work as of right now. It's not rushed. It's a movie made with passion. The « weird » moments if you accept them. You will laugh. If not. It's really bizarre and you know what. I'm sure that's what Ti West wanted !,2022-03-23
"1979. A group of aspiring young filmmakers rent an old farmhouse owned by an odd elderly couple as the location for an X-rated movie. Said young folks find their lives in jeopardy after the old couple find out what kind of motion picture they are making.Writer/director Ti West relates the familiar, but still enjoyable and engrossing story at a steady pace, takes time to develop the sharply drawn characters (even the weird elderly couple manage to elicit a fair amount of sympathy), expertly crafts a brooding gloom-doom atmosphere that's rife with dread and unease, perfectly captures the grungy aesthetic of a 1970's horror exploitation flick, and delivers a handy helping of bloody gore along with some tasty female nudity and sizzling softcore sex. Better still, West not only sprinkles in loving nods to many horror genre classics, but also provides a surprisingly rich subtext concerning thwarted desire, ruthless ambition, the ravages of time and old age, and harsh old testament-style puritanism run lethally amuck in a morally bankrupt world.The sturdy acting from an ace cast rates as another substantial asset: Mia Goth as both eager coke-snorting wannabe starlet Maxine and bitter withered old hag Pearl, Jenna Ortega as the quiet and reserved Lorraine, Brittany Snow as the brash and jaded Bobby-Lynne, Kid Cudi as easygoing stud Jackson, Martin Henderson as the cocky Wayne, Owen Campbell as pretentious nerd director RJ, and Stephen Ure as cranky old-timer Howard. An excellent movie.",2022-07-27
"I'm not much for slashers, especially the modern ones that have just gotten way over-the-top. This was more like a nod to the older style of slasher, less about the gore and more about the kill if you know what I mean. It would have been easy to just dump buckets of blood, but they didn't do that. I also went in expecting a big, exploitive T&A flick which is not what it was. There are a couple of scenes of people shooting the porno, but they're not there for spank bait. They're part of the plot, there's minimal nudity, and there are jokes being made throughout.While it was a nod to the old school, it also had some very original points to it. If you're into slashers, X is a pretty good one.",2022-11-04
"This is the most adult film I've ever seen. Throwback to vintage porn and vintage horror at the same time. Once this slow burner gets going into the horror stuff, it doesn't pull any punches. Some of the kills will leave you wincing and others laughing. Very confused as to why Mia Goth is playing dual roles though.",2022-03-30
"It's not scary at all. The old lady does the choreographed dance crap like Joaquin phoenix in Joker 2019...You might as well just watch the Suspiria(2018) remake. That film is heavy. This was ok. The sex aspect is just 70s cheese. A couple years ago, after Hereditary, and the Witch I literally posted that A24 needs to stop having naked old people in every film...So I can't take this serious at all. Once again, naked old people aren't SCARY. Just gross. It's like they saw my comment and wanted to get me angry with this film here. I also noticed alot of the background soundtrack is from Halloween 2007, Dawn of Dead 2004, because it was composed by the same guy. Tyler bates. Although the music is indeed creepy and intense, need to update your instruments buddy. I had Halloween 2007 flashbacks.",2022-04-15
"""X"" is another solid exploitation-horror rehash from writer-director-editor Ti West; taking place in rural Texas in late '79, it follows a group of pornographers. Intending to make their own adult film, they rent a guest house from a very aged farmer (Stephen Ure) and his fragile wife Pearl. Eventually, this conservative old couple cotton on to what the youngsters are doing, and set out to punish them - I mean REALLY punish them.Shot through with ominous atmosphere almost right from the start, this actually has more on its mind than just titillation and visceral horror. Rather, it's pretty poignant when it makes the viewer think about the effects of ageing, and one can take some pity on this long-married man & wife. It also obliges the viewer to think about peoples' perceived notions of sex & sexuality.But West doesn't skimp on other aspects. His typically slow & measured pacing works well, and this does get positively creepy and twisted at times. The gore is quite effective, although there may not be enough sex & nudity for some viewers, given the nature of the film-within-the-film. West also takes the time to subvert at least one expectation.The cast gives it 100%, with Mia Goth proving to be particularly watchable in what is a dual role. Jenna Ortega, Brittany Snow, Kid Cudi (also an executive producer), Martin Henderson, Owen Campbell, and Ure are all good in support. While you never believe that the actors playing Howard & Pearl are nearly as old as they're playing, they give memorably striking performances.I also enjoyed the little twist West throws in right at the end, and the soundtrack full of appropriate needle drops.Followed very soon after by the prequel ""Pearl"".Seven out of 10.",2023-10-15
"Didn't know what to expect with X, it's not anything special, but not bad.Something different for sure, the problem's with its comical tone being a horror film, there's no tension or suspense in it. Has a solid cast, I particularly liked the overhead view of the croc coming and ""Landslide."" Even though matching the tone of the film, many of the character's actions are still unforgivable.",2022-07-23
"It seems like 70's era horror is gradually making a comeback with movies such as last year's The Black Phone and Ti West's latest horror film, X, where both movies take place in the 70's and continually make references to other slasher movies, most notably movies like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.What makes Ti West's X stand out though is that it's a subversive meta-slasher film which borders on being a parody rather than a serious slasher flick. For the most part, the movie does play out like a serious horror slasher whilst simultaneously subverting elements of the slasher genre like the sexploitation angle and the voyeuristic gaze of the killer POV shots. Similar to Cabin in the Woods, X comes across as a self-aware horror film which contains enough humor and doesn't take itself too seriously.Overall, X offers a fairly decent throwback to 70's horror but compared to The Black Phone, it just slightly misses the mark for me, mainly because of the movie's pacing. The movie does a good job of building up tension in the first two acts but then quickly loses momentum in the third act where the kills feel formulaic and stale. I also feel the movie sometimes didn't strike the right balance between serious horror and meta-horror comedy.However, X is still a good watch for fans of slasher movies and it's definitely worth checking out for those who enjoy analysing the slasher genre as a whole.",2022-09-25
"X is an overall good, porno, horror-slasher that has good kills and disturbing scenes that will make you believe how horror is done. I liked the movie because it has good scenes and an alright plot.",2022-03-21
"With more creativity and imagination, ""X"" could have been a new generation's ""Scream.""And at first that seems to be where the movie's headed. In its sassy, tongue-in-cheek recreation of a ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" vibe, complete with a van and a house that looks exactly like the one in the Tobe Hooper classic, the film promises to be a meta exercise in self aware horror. But somewhere midpoint, when it has to start disposing of characters, the film becomes disappointingly pedestrian and thuddingly literal. The kills come one after the other with little build up or suspense, with the perfunctory boredom of ticking off items on a to-do list. The motivation behind the killers is no dumber than in any number of other horror movies before it, so that's not inherently a problem. But they're turned into such exaggerated ghouls (just because they're old) that they stop being scary or menacing and become laughable.I was really looking forward to this movie and was really bummed that it wasn't better.Grade: B-",2022-08-09
"You can't expect too much from this genre of movies. The stories are just very basic, most of the time it's just about shocking the audience. In this case there are some graphic slasher scenes that fans of the genre will appreciate. The acting wasn't bad either. A bit of nudity as well, some of good-looking people but also from not as good-looking which made it a bit creepy. X is for slasher fans, so if you're not into that genre just skip it.",2022-07-12
"With the new aged turn horror has taken it's been awhile for a GOOD horror film. This film kept some classic elements of horror and then also touches on some good psychological views from the characters AND the audience. The topics of the horror of getting old, human sexuality, feminism, religion etc.Pros:
-Great filming and cinematography! Literally A+
-Great actors, literally everyone.-Original idea with some dash of classic tropes
-Personally what I expected and more
-the gore
-the feeling of being exactly in the past settingCons:
only wish there was more slashing through out the whole movie, instead of only beginning 3/4 throughOverall extremely impressed!!! Has for sure became a horror favorite.",2022-03-19
Normally bad slashers are goofy enough that they are fun to watch. I found this movie to be boring and predictable. Nothing about this movie felt creative or interesting.I'd rather watch M. Night Shyamalan's The Last Airbender than watch this movie again.,2022-04-19
"The movie wasn't scary. The first hour literally nothing happens, just a lot of quite generous scenes of beautiful young actors and scenery. There is no sense of doom, there is no ""something is odd"" feeling, nothing. Just bunch of fairly attractive people making porno movie in middle of some rural area. There is some slightly chilling scene with the alligator but that was it for first hour. Then it became a slasher, just a slasher, with two so ridiculous looking old people that I knew, in instant, it was just over-the-top ""old people"" make up. They looked like they were over 100!It has some 70s or 80s slasher vibe, and lots of generous killings, and it does have some nostalgic sense, like it takes a lot of inspiration from movies from 40 or 50 years ago. Other than that, nothing new, nothing scary, nothing in psychological thriller area, just nostalgic looking slasher with lots of pretty people. So, if you like that, here you go!",2022-05-02
"The movie was boring and primitive, I absolutely do not recommend watching it.Everything in the movie is depressing - from colors to the people and context. The cruelty of some scenes is enormous, dialogs are very shallow, women are portrayed like prostitutes including a teenage girl, the old actors are made so purposefully ugly, and the animal instincts of the grandmother .. I just wonder - why? The director apparently has no respect to old people what so ever. The story is enormously messed up, plus is developing so slowly, literally nothing happens until a half of the movie has passed, then the blood bath in the end, omg, just recalling this makes me so happy that the movie is over. Especially naive are the ""artistic"" tries to put various scenes next to each other - an attempt to make something so tasteless and meaningless look like there is a philosophy behind. Truly, the aftertaste of this movie is disgusting, I feel sorry for the wasted time, this is the worst movie I have recently seen.",2022-04-16
"This movie is a pretty poor offering. Excessively geriatric killers are insulting. It's insulting what the movie expects us to accept. There's just nothing here of value, it's going to be a waste of your time. Not to mention the random cheesiness, like the recoil of a barreled rifle sending one of the aforementioned geriatrics flying backwards 7 feet and killing her. Like, what? Geriatric or not, grandma was still like 100lbs. So on top of being unable to take this movie seriously in any way, they also sprinkled in nonsense scenes. It's all a time-wasting joke.",2022-08-03
"""X"" is the purest synonym of the renewal of the slasher genre, a film that mixes all the virtues of the classics with new concepts, very well worked, with a great direction, clumsy, fun performances and with very interesting visuals. Ti West, the director of the feature, used and abused his creative freedom, using as a reference many classics, but as his main inspiration the great ""Chainsaw Massacre"", the script seeks to explore sexuality, contrasting with the lack of it, a script that it advances the clichés of the genre and subverts a lot of them, but in a natural and organic way, its entire narrative structure works very well and engages the viewer little by little. The director uses a lot of metalanguage, the initial and final scenes are examples of this, in addition to several cuts and edits that fit together and complement scenes of what is actually happening with the home movie that is shot in parallel with the protagonists, interesting resources, well-crafted script, quality black humor, charismatic performances and precise direction. But what about the gore? After all, we're talking about a slasher movie, gore exists! But it's not exaggerated, the most uncomfortable and disgusting scenes don't involve gore. Among the various narrative games, there is an interesting one, one of the protagonists is a homemade film director who is wanting to make a porn that will ""revolutionize the genre"" or ""change the way a film is edited"" are expressions of the director's obstinacy, and many of these lines are minor spoilers of the visuals employed, clearly this character is an alter ego of the director. ""x"" is a declaration of love for the slasher genre. 8.5/10.",2022-08-17
"This movie is really for a particular crowd. I love a24 films, but don't care for slashers that much. However this movie served as a mysterious slasher with the classic a24 style. If you hate slashers and a2 movies you'll hate this and if you just don't like a24 films, you probably won't care too much for this. Mix in both and this has the recipe to be some peoples all time favorite. It's creepy, gross and violent while also having something most slashers don't have... a realistic reason behind the slashing... a motive to the crime that seems plausible. Of course there's some standout dumb moments and some parts that are a little out there but overall this was enjoyable and something I felt like I could see again when it's streaming and still enjoy. They didn't go overboard with the nudity and sex which I liked, it focused on the plot and didn't try to get peoples approval with certain things. Slashers tend to cap out for me, as there's too many really good movies that are a lot better in the 8's and 9's.... but for a slasher a 7/10 for me is is very good. Well done a24!",2022-04-05
"It was a bit different story line. But I appreciated the fact that it was a story that hadn't been portrayed previously. It had some genuine chills and thrills that caught me off guard; just what you want from a horror movie.Something else I truly appreciated about the movie was the lack of special effects and CGI which is very rare in most movies today. Admittedly, it seemed that the makeup artist was working overtime on the actors and particularly the ""old"" characters makeup was definitely overdone. To that point, I wondered could the producers not have found actual people in their 70s/80s+ to play the elderly couple without making them look like walking corpses? That aside, I did enjoy the movie.Good story development with decent acting. As current horror movies go, I thought it was pretty good.My 7 stars is for the originality of the story and to also give credit to a low-budget movie that overachieved. Bravo!",2022-10-20
"Events of Pearl, acting as a sequential 70+ year sequel to it or vice versa Pearl as a prequel to this terrible excuse of a movie, having nothing but sun, dust, wind and visual effects. Even the thrill, flow, vibe and gore were so so, any visual shininess getting dissolved in acidic nonsense.And that TV with that preaching program on at all times and nobody blasted it with a gust of Winchester. That's how you get brainwashed. At least, I got to see Jenna Ortega's character scream and being scared out of her mind, eyes popping out.

"X is surprising in all the right ways and very so refreshing and an interesting slow burn. It sets itself up as a smart take on the slasher films of the 70s and early 80s. One of the greatest horror movies I've seen in a while. The acting was good, the scares were good, the effects were good. Many recognizable faces who play great and enjoyable characters w/even cooler personalities!",2022-04-29
"The best thing about X is the visuals. The synergy between director and cinematographer was reminiscent of some of the great slashers and it certainly helps to elevate this film in style.However, for a slasher movie I was disappointed in the story. I do appreciate the attempt at doing something different with the antagonist but it was very unrealistic. I can buy a cannibalistic wielding chainsaw maniac, but the evil in X is more symbolic than terrifying.All in all, this was okay but not memorable and more of an art house take on the genre.",2022-04-20
"This will surely be the best horror of the year. It is clearly a homage to past horror classics, particularly the Hillbilly Horror genre. But at the same time it is also an original idea for a horror movie. I have never seen a horror movie which uses the fear of ageing as the energy that turns the antagonist evil. And also, it is an excellent example of a Hillbilly horror, not a derivative homage. Totally engaging from start to finish. Explores lots of interesting themes, sex, youth, entrepreneurship, race. Just brilliant. Cements Ti West as one of the most innovative and trustable horror directors.",2022-04-27
"A great slasher flick, with interesting subjects and a great back story under the surface.It's not only about the nudes and the massacre part, Ti West has something unique to say.Although, the trailers wants you to believe that you'll see something more surrendered to the horror genre but in the end you're getting a slasher movie. Even if the result is beautiful and well worked, I'd like the studio to be more honest in the first place (We love A24 anyway).",2022-04-11
"I saw the film last Friday and think it's pretty spectacular. As A24-distributed films are practically a genre onto themselves, the knowledgeable audience know what to expect and won't be disappointed upon experiencing the film.",2022-03-23
"The movie Joe made in the distant past dealt with generational differences and the contempt that the older generation had for the younger one. Texas Chainsaw Massacre, made roughly during the same time frame, dealt with young people being in the wrong place in Texas at the wrong time. If we put these two general plots together, we pretty much have X. So if you liked those two films, you might like this one. I didn't I found the film too much like Joe and Chainsaw combined, and I was hoping to see something original. But it wasn't;; it was just another piece of exploitative junk. Don't waste your time or money on this turkey.",2022-10-06
"I was the only person in theatre.. will remember this movie all my life 😊
Movie was ok.. nothing new.. same old slasher movie. It's hardly 1.5 hours long. First one hour nothing happens except for few nudity and vulgarity to attract audience. Last 30 mins are all the killings and screaming. Pointless and no one explain that why the old couple are killing their guests.However I was surprised to know that for Mia it was a double role. She played the antagonist old women as well.I watched the movie cos I had unlimited card. Director is so confident of the idiotic of his audience that he had written the prequel of this movie in lockdown even before the release. Please someone stop him for shooting another garbage.",2022-03-23
"Pleasently suprised by this modern horror following the old school scripture, with a touch of italian cinema. Great casting, great editing, great sets/decors, great pace, great effects. Very enjoyable!",2022-04-22
"This movie was relatively bizarre. The lesbian granny is never quite explained but I'll just chalk it up to lunacy. Visually has the Texas chainsaw massacre feel to it. For me it was pretty predictable, no surprises really but I did like a few unexpected ways the film was edited to mesh different scenes together at different points. Some things didn't make sense, like why in one of the scenes one of characters was singing ""Landslide"" by Fleetwood Mac for 3 minutes. I'm not quite sure of the point of that as it just seemed jammed in there for no apparent reason. The death scenes were pretty well done and the acting was solid. Not sure I would watch it again, but I had pretty low expectations for this film but it ended up being better than expected.",2022-10-09
"1979, very stereotyped with seen before hooks of isolated setting with young adults filming sex scenes. An odd farm couple adds to the fun by horrifically interrupting the fun sex filming. An unusual, not seen before reason, and for that alone it gets a slightly higher rating.",2022-07-09
"Most slasher movies, no matter how popular, usually have a low rating because they're not known for their quality scripts, great dialogue and good acting. X breaks the rule of offering only gore and I was surprised how much I liked it. The camera work and and locations offer some extra quality to this movie. The acting is actually very good and there's planty of eye candy to go around. I like how the gore only starts in the second half of the movie so for those who are not hardcore fans of the genre, it won't be boring or too hard on your heart. Even the music was a lot of fun. I also believe the gore was spectacular, not sloppy like most movies of this kind. Bravo TI West and crew, you have just upgraded the genre.",2022-05-04
"I liked the movie. The plot was okay, acting job was ok even better for a horror movie. I was surprised when i learned that actually Mia Goth was the old lady. I mean wow. . . Sound design, camera work, musics were very good. I laughed when the old lady starting to dance after she killed the boy. Remined me the Joker. Anyway if you like horror, specially the slashers you gonna like it.",2022-06-15
"As mentioned in the film, the story regarding the filming of a porn movie acts as a kind of smoke screen to relax you into a state of unpreparedness for the carnage that follows. Those who know Ti West's work will feel all the more uneasy, knowing his knack for unsettling your nerves to the fullest. The exaggerated make-up of the old couple makes them especially creepy.This has a build up and atmosphere that reminds
one of films like the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre.",2022-04-14
"I found the movie pretty slow and give us directly a subject to talk about: Sex. A lot of sexual references and talks. But what i found interesting despite the free nudity and sex its the way that ""innocent"" girl in the crew talk about sex and how she wants to participate later: make sex a normal thing and normal subject to talk about and the movie reveal also a the naughtiness part of the womens. Only this part was interesting for me when she stands her position and want to participate in the porn movie that the guys were doing. And that make us less guilty to watch sex in screen and less shame about it. We can clearly identify ourself with that Lorraine chick. I found the story a little bit simple and contain more violence and sex for nothing and we become a voyeur in that movie: they show crude sexual scenes and nudity and its pretty the main theme of the movie. The old couple was interesting and become a treat when the woman just want to have sex but her husband cant satisfy her because he is too old. It can make sense but it was way too simple. The movie really want us to talk about sex like a daily them or discussion and we witnessed their activities. The movie also have some crude violence and gore: sometimes it was too much for nothing. At the end, we realised that the old couple was not really hard to kill and that make them pretty inoffensive and really the movie turn into a comedy mix with horror. But the comedy was way too much present in my opinion. The story make sense and we understand why the old couple act like this (lack of time, lack sexual performances.) but it was way too simple and not that complex. Some scenes are pretty hilarious and make us laugh and fear about the old people but they didnt really feel like a big threat. If we saw how the girl saved herself at the end was pretty simple and clearly lack of complexity. I spend a good time but too much free violence, sex, nudity and comedy for nothing. A good movie anyway in a comedy side and the talk about sex can be quite interesting. The horror was only the gore scenes but we dont really felt that the old couple was a really big threat.I need also to say that i enjoyed also the sound design and the soundtrack all along the movie and really gave an original ambience And atmosphere during the whole movie. The cinematography too and the lights during the killing was pretty effective. Good anyway.",2022-10-31
"X marks Indie director Ti West's triumphant return to the Horror genre.The trailer suggests Boogie Nights meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre - that is to say - generous amounts of nudity and gore.And the film delivers on that promise. And then some.Sex and violence. 70's style. With a fun, darkly comic tone.Nothing you haven't really seen before. But executed with style and skill.Though Mia Goth is getting a lot of praise for her role(s), Britanny Snow steals the show in my opinion.Her portrayal as Bobby-Lynne, the unapologetically sexy and savvy Southern Belle, is the real standout.",2022-05-18
This was just ok. I feel like we were missing some of the story. The old woman seem to have an interest in one of the young girls but I don't know why. I almost feel like there was some more story to it and it was somehow edited out. It wasn't as gory as I thought it would be and it was really just okay. I feel like these two old people would never have the strength to kill these young people. The old guy on TV seems kind of pointless but I think that's to set up the prequel movie. The great reviews must be from people that were associated with the production of this movie. It's really not that good and it's not something I'd watch again. There are much better movies out there like Wolf Creek.,2022-04-17
"A horror film (which seems to be spawning its own cinematic universe) from earlier this year. It's 1979 in Texas & a group of friends (Martin Henderson, Mia Goth, Brittany Snow, Kid Cudi, Jenna Ortega & Owen Campbell) have decided to make a porno at a secluded cabin at a ranch one fine day. They've rented the location from an elderly couple (Stephen Ure/Goth again in old age make-up) who don't seem to be all there as we see Goth wander around the grounds muttering to herself but the group proceeds to film their scenes w/Ortega, brought along as crew w/cameraman Campbell, & the abundance of sexual activity abounding, decides to film a scene of her own, which pisses Campbell off who leaves the cabin in a huff but little does he know old Goth, in a fit of frustrated anger (since Ure is heart attack prone & can't satisfy her like he used to) starts offing the attendants one by one. West's return to horror (who's House of the Devil is very good) almost makes a movie which feels like it wrote itself w/the obvious set up & location a no brainer so much so a movie called Pearl (a prequel tracing how old Goth became unhinged) is still playing in theaters & a sequel is on the way focusing on one of the survivors of X making West a shrewd businessman w/his creative coffers brimming over w/possibilities.",2022-11-01
"What we have here is a mediocre script executed beautifully. Like his other films, it just looks amazing. The cinematography is the star here, mixed with fantastic editing. Man, what I'd give to see Ti West make a film with a strong script because this guy makes beautiful looking movies that are very well paced. I didn't hate the script, but I dunno, maybe some more memorable lines? I just wanted the second half to stand out a little more and be a little crazier I think. However, the gore and kills did look great... but they aren't exactly anything you haven't seen before.I will say this though... that last shot gun blast was a knee slapping doozy if I ever saw one. It made me scream out in joy. I had to rewind it 5 times because it was so awesome. What a shot! -pun intended- Keep an eye out for it. You might never look at a screen door the same way... LoLSo what we got here is a fun horror movie. What makes it special is it's incredibly good cinematography, whether the lighting is super bright in the Texas sun or incredibly dark and foreboding. Hats off to the director of the photography. It really felt and looked like it was 1979 with its minimal amount of sets. Great wardrobe, makeup and casting. It screamed 1979.",2022-07-19
"This is not a real review, it should be taken more as a collection of impressions on the film.Beautiful girls and tits, I believe that these two things are almost the only ones that make the film watchable because for the rest it is a very banal disturbing thriller with a lot of blood and some parts that are also quite deliberately disgusting. The film tries very hard to seem like an author's masterpiece with particular camera movements and interesting photography, but it fails quite a bit in its aim and this lowers its rating a little because it would have been better perhaps if the film had remained a very simple thriller with beautiful girls and unpretentious. Even the plot at times tries to be different but it is precisely in the less banal parts that the film's major defects are found, and I'm not saying that they were wrong to dare, absolutely not, I'm just saying that this daring is done quite badly and without a clear idea. So in conclusion the film is sufficient and also has a little more but personally I expected much, much more.",2023-10-19
There is nothing wrong with doing homages to classic films and using old tropes to say something about them. I enjoy films that do that so why didn't I like this? Because it didn't do anything with those homages or tropes to make it stand out from those original films. We've seen all the tropes before and the tropes aren't presented in a way that's unique nor did I see any commentary about them present within the film. They just used them because it made sense and that annoyed me as it made the story incredibly predictable and boring. The only part that makes this story stand out is the set up as it's a group of people using an old cabin to film a porno. We haven't seen anything like that and it was interesting to see a horror film have a different set up every once in a while. The film looks great though. The cinematography is great and it was the presentation of the film that kept me going along with the performances. Mia Goth and Jenna Ortega did a great job and I'm interested to see where their careers go from here. The actual kills themselves felt largely bland. There were one or two that caught me off guard with how unique they were everything else felt like your typical horror movie kills without adding anything unique to them. They showed a trailer for the prequel film at the end that looked so much better than this and it sucks that the best part of this movie was that prequel trailer. I struggle to recommend checking this out as you can watch other horror films and get the same tropes but if you want some interesting presentation and setup for a horror film then maybe check this out.,2022-04-16
"LMAOO no way y'all had me watch this!! I came here for jenna and wth she only got busy for like 1 minute. Idgaf bout everybody else i was here for JENNA, JENNA, AND JENNA ORTEGA. Wasted about an hour of my life on this garbage movie 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾",2022-04-15
"Cringy to watch. Slow paced and just so bad. What happened to horror movies? This wasn't scary, just gory. Main character wasn't likable, plot was strange, no twists, I watched the whole movie waiting for an explanation of the high rating and never found out.",2022-08-19
"I was not sure , should i whatch this movie or not.I was curious till the end of the film. And i was not disappointed.All these Actresses and Actors did a tremendeous job.But the best of this film, is the screenplay.So grab some popcorns. And enjoy this film.",2022-05-30
"Some people will probably hate this movie or complain about it but those people are not the people this movie was made for. It's a fun, scary, comical, gory tribute to slasher films of the past. This movie beautifully combines the cheesy, bloody horror tropes from the 70's with the more recent artsy touches you see in newer horror today. And the cinematography!! WOW is all I can say. Do not pass on this one, definitely one of the best horrors made in years.",2022-04-03
"It could have been a better movie, but for the decision to have Mia Goth play both the protagonist and Pearl. It was so obvious Pearl was played by a young actress (round face, string movements, voice that isn't actually cracking) that I was kind of expecting her to become younger later in the movie - something that will justify this decision. This kept it impossible for me to suspend my disbelief - I was too much aware of the acting all the time. What did they get from doing that - just to be special?",2022-06-11
"In the end of the 70's, a group is filming adult films in a farm and things turns to get mysterious.This definitely interesting, it seems risky to make a classic horror movies these days, but they made it perfectly.The film's whole vibe was the thing I liked the most, It gives you 70's and 80's vibes, and it contains a lot of sexual scenes maybe more than the bloody ones, but it's ok, because it makes things looks normal before the storm shows up.It was easy sometimes to predict what is coming next, maybe just like every other horror movie.I really enjoyed it, but if you're willing to watch it, think of doing it with a company, the thing I didn't.The direction was remarkable, ut served the vibe, those transition were just perfect for me!Finally, it's good to see Jenna Ortega in such a project, and Mia Goth is a star!Great job from the old man and woman too.I'm not into horror movies, but this one wins!",2022-05-29
"I actually felt that this film let me down. A couple of the deaths felt like they were very jammed and hardly epic and the ending also let me down. Overall it was an ok film wasn't as good as I expected and hearing about but like I said some of the deaths were just meh. Like what happens to the old guy really really let me down. Most of the characters were underwritten for what they were supposed to be. Mia Goth was great easily the best part of the film. I guess I was just expecting so much more out of it an was hoping the Gore would have stayed consistent. I mean the beginning gore was great the opening I don't know how I feel about it but it's a one time watch for me and the ""adult content"" seems no different from an average horror movie.",2022-05-17
"I liked it. 8/10. Very epic cinematography. Good music. Very epic movie. Good job, Ti West. You get a thumbs up from me. Fun for the whole family. Kids will love it.",2022-03-24
"This movie isn't reinventing the wheel and its derivative, but when its done this well thats fine with me. If you want to see a decent 80sstyle slasher film this is a really good one. It reminded me of watching the early Friday the 13th movies A LOT, much deja vu, but in a good way. If you liked the first few Friday the 13ths and Texas Chainsaw this should be fun for you. Definitely had its own unique weirdness even though it reminds of other movies. Could have done without some of the gross scenes (or darker lighting maybe). I missed these types of films.",2022-04-26
"Insufferable characters, nonexistent plot and soundtrack, absolutely no point to this movie. Worst movie I've seen in years. You'll make a better use of your time watching the Sam Raimi Spiderman movies.",2022-04-23
"There are several well-established plotlines in the horror genre that nearly all the films in this genre fall into. One example deals with the paranatural existences, whether it's a ghost or a banshee or some incarnation of devil himself. Another major theme revovles around the concept of unknown, hideous creatures that a group of adventurers/scientists encounter in a new planet/place/zone. A third thread is centered upon unfriendly neighbors/landlords and a bloody conflict that follows between them and a group of friends that find themselves at the mercy of those maniacs.X is a very stereotypical case of the third model, in which a bunch of adult film crew rent a rickety farm from an old, very scary/creepy couple to shoot a cheap, so-called independent adult production. Like many other cinephiles, I have a knack for film-within-a-film pictures, hence it's one of the reasons this film got good reviews. But is X really a good, enjoyable and worthy horror film? Well, the answer is no in my opinion.The film has a handful of qualities to praise. I thought Kid Kudi was brilliant in his role, I liked the creative shots director Ti West used in this piece and I was engaged by the allegories related to religion, Christianity and evangelism. But this film fall into lots of traps that are so well-known and recognized in the horror genre that you'd think they aren't that hard to bypass. First of all, they protagonists are annoyingly dumb and brainless. I know that they are adult performers and them being dumb is not a head-scratcher component, but still the mere sight of our male antagonist should steer them far far away from that ranch. Another trap to mention is the laughable amount of cliches and obvious story points. Specifically I was able to predict all that was hapenning in the final third act with relative ease. I could correctly guess who was going to survive and how and what would eventually become of these characters and I had to remind myself that this is not a rewatch.All in all, X doesn't offer anything new, it just re-serves what we have already chewed with catchy colours and flavours.",2022-05-10
"Zero expectations or knowledge about this movie when I turned this one on. I knew it was a horror movie and that was it. Watching it, I could feel the love that the creators had for the old age of horror movies, the era of slashers and all the things that Scream once dissected and made light of, an age of horror movie rules where you expect sex to equal death and the final girl to surmount all odds and take on the horrible entity terrorizing them.The idea of this movie seems like something I should have really enjoyed. The reality of it was more underwhelming. I never found myself connecting to the characters, so when things start to go awry, I had no investment in their existence. They were just red shirts in a horror movie. I expected them to die and most of them met that expectation. It was fine. It never really tipped the scales into love, never into hate, it lingered in the realm of quiet acceptance of what was going on, a positive tolerance that never reached proper enjoyment.",2023-09-25
Good acting performances and well executed production. Important character scenes took their time. The story surprises and twists pretty well I really enjoyed it.,2022-08-26
"""Hollywood here we come"". Uh not quite. More like somewhere outside of sultry Houston, Texas. That's where the events in 2022's X (my latest review) happen. ""Get the cameras rolling, get the action going"". Indeed.Not really scary and not avant-garde in a perverted sort of way, X takes place in the late 1970s and is filmed like a ""Me Decade"" movie. We're talking long shots, wide shots, zoom ins, zoom outs, crosses, and a bit of the grainy. I mean if you're gonna make a flick set in 1979, you might as well have the audience be taken aback.Ti West (X's veteran helmer) knows where to put the camera and can think in cuts. Oh and the classic rock soundtrack is decent. It's not West's direction that's the culprit, it's his victim characters who try to be witty and likable but end up being rather uncouth. Then there's the antagonists played by two senior citizens who were probably in their 90s. You'd have to believe that this husband and wife team could dispatch people like Jason Voorhees, be able to snap to it, and still have a little nookie on the side (which they do). This whole premise in X is quite misguided and that nookie image is something I'll probably never be able to shake (ugh).Distributed by A24 and actually filmed in Queenstown, New Zealand (I didn't pick up on that), X is about a group of young filmmakers who set out to make a pornographic pic only to be hunted down by a couple of kooky killers who live near their shooting location. Masked locales begot, you can basically call X Super 8 for the adult film industry or The Texas Chain Saw Massacre for the AARP crowd. Its movie within a movie stature is neither innovative nor original enough. ""X out"".",2022-06-01
"First I got to say: I'm not a big fan of horror-movies, but once in a while I like to consume the genre.Now, from a visual standpoint, I'd say, this one is rather in B-movie category,
but it doesn't fail to keep the tension flowing,
and also has a very sarcastic, ironic storry-telling.I like the plot,
here and there it could have been a little bit more believable,
but all in all -
it's a watch!",2022-04-13

"This is actually quite good! An original take on one of those slasher movies, a mixture of Friday 13th, Lake Placid and cabin in the woods combined with soft porn. There are some cringeworthy parts that will make you funnily be sick involving a naked old woman, or an old couple in their 70s bonking.It's good.",2022-06-25
"I loved the setting, the pace, the cinematography of the first half of the film but during the second half it falls short of expectations and fizzles out.It was a different concept to what I originally expected from the trailer where it seemed like the old lady is some kind of supernatural creature or similar.. also I don't like it when they use young actors to play old actors as they're simply incapable of doing it right. Old people move in a completely different fashion due to their lack of muscles and posture etc.It was very clear it was a younger actor under the make-up and it was just sticking out like a sore thumb.. just get someone who looks like her.. there are plenty of good actors out there..Had potential to be great but I found the second half really slow and it lost me although I liked the twist in the end with the tele-evangelist.Could have been so much better!",2022-04-23
"It isn't a typical horror. It's weird. It's chilled. However, I like how things were put together in this movie, the funny conversations and the ending wasn't bad. All about the vibe.",2022-04-28
This movie was like if Quentin Tarantino filmed Texas Chainsaw Massacre... very fun horror flick. Very grotesque and unsettling scenes that ultimately made for a great movie. Excellent dialogue throughout the movie with the film crew as well as Pearl and her husband. Third act is pretty insane and leads up to a great climax. One of my favorite horror movies.,2022-03-20
"I honestly will have a tough time giving my thoughts, but I will try my best. The movie X (2022) might divide people with some liking it and the others not liking it, I did like it in some way.I will start off by saying that the acting is good, Actress Mia Goth was good and gave a believable performance for a character in the 1970's trying to make an adult film at that time. She also plays this old woman named Pearl in the movie and she was also believable in that role.There are good suspenseful moments and disturbing moments that can be scary, along with there being gory kills that are effective and have a purpose in being there.There is some clues or hints to the backstory of the character Pearl, but they keep you without answers, and this movie has things to say about the adult film industry for how it is portrayed either for present day or in the 70's.There are great cinematography shots and sound effects for the setting of the movie on the farm that makes you feel like you are there. The director Ti West did do an excellent job with this movie and put a lot of time into it, after watching this movie I might wait a while before watching it again because I still need to process it.The movie does end with you asking questions about the characters and what is going on, leaving lots of things without answers which is fine. I do like the 70's feel to the movie, and I liked how it felt like a slasher movie from the 70's like Friday the 13th in a way.I do not think the movie X (2022) is a spectacular horror movie, but I did enjoy it from beginning to end and how it was put together and how the focus in the movie can be connected to present day. There are going to be people who will be divided on this movie, but if you look closely on how it is put together and it plays out you might like it more.",2022-09-19
"Are you simultaneously disgusted by and terrified of really old people? Then this movie is for you. If you think a really scary scene would be an old lady trying to kiss somebody and later getting naked for no reason, then give it a go.Some young people go to a farmhouse to film a porno and the elderly couple that own the place are creepy. The old lady is played by the same actress as the young woman. It's just her in old lady makeup. So the entire time I'm waiting for the twist that tells you why her older self is there killing everybody. IT IS NEVER EXPLAINED. Anyway halfway through the movie the killing starts and that part is as gruesome as expected. It just takes awhile to get there. Just like with the porno they are filming, don't watch this horror movie for plot because it won't make sense.",2022-12-24
"An obvious homage to Tobe Hooper's TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and EATEN ALIVE, X manages to pay tribute to its influences yet quickly develops its own feel. Fine performances all around and an interesting choice for the killer(s), any slasher film fan thirsting for a good old school romp should be satisfied.Big plus here for a couple of gator scenes that are truly suspenseful. Those producing the silly CGI SyFy monster films should take note.",2022-03-27
Original horror about a porn flick being shot in a Texas hamlet. The whole crew/cast are shooting the flick and living on an old couple's house out back. The hosts don't like any funny business and funny business abounds when that's what you make movies about. The old couple find out about the sexy goings on and get busy.,2022-05-21
"The basic plot of this horror flick is a small film crew hires out a barn conversion from a farmer in what I think was Texas in the 1970s to make a porn movie. The movie is well made, the actors, led by Mia Goth and Brittany Snow are all good and the cinematography is great, but as horrors go it just isn't anything special, there is nothing that would frighten or shock anyone past puberty, the movie takes forever to get to the time of screaming, and the kills are incredibly boring. Yet another modern horror which fixates on style over substance. On the plus side, it's far superior to the awful 'Midsommar' and I'll probably watch the prequel 'Pearl'.",2022-11-26

"Pulpy, fun, violent and artistic. Classic meets new age, slasher meets A24, Tarantino meets Craven. A rocking soundtrack, lively cast and stunning deep Texas setting lay stage for a thoughtful and we'll excuted little film which pays homage to great slashers of old, particularly The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but does so with a rare delicacy and genuinely well developed and disturbing motivations behind the killings. Ti West is really one to watch and is promising to be, alongside Eggers and Aster, a horror master of his generation. *warning bloody and sexually explicit throughout*",2022-05-15
"X is the first in a trilogy by a director I have only heard of recently, Ti West. I'm not usually a big horror fan, but lately I have been watching more of it. Maybe because it's almost Halloween, who knows?The story follows a group of amateur porn filmmakers and actors in Texas in 1979 that want to cash in on the burgeoning adult film industry. They go outside Houston where they live and work to a rural, depressed area and encounter Howard and Pearl, an elderly couple that rent the guest house to them, unaware of what their guests are up to. The couple immediately give off a creepy, hostile vibe and once the jig is up, that's when the horror begins.X pays homage to past horror/thriller films like Psycho, the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Hardcore, The Shining, and Alligator, just to name a few. However, it doesn't imitate them too much. X feels like a stylish, yet disturbing horror film in its own right. The murders are all done in an interesting way and there's little bits of foreshadowing of how each character dies that you only realize once you go back and re-watch it.The standout performances are of course Mia Goth as Maxine, the burlesque dancer determined to become a bona-fide porn queen, Brittany Snow as Bobby-Lynn, Maxine's fellow dancer as a blonde bombshell type, Jenna Ortega as the shy boom operator Lorraine that completely does a 180 as far as her character is concerned, Martin Henderson as the cocky producer Wayne, Kid Cudi as Jackson, the lead actor of the film and Vietnam vet, Owen Campbell as RJ, the camera man determined to elevate porn to an avant-garde level, and of course, Howard and Pearl. I have not seen Brittany Snow in ages and I was surprised to see her in such a sexy, grown up role. She did a great job and can actually sing very well.I won't spoil it, but there were twists with the Maxine and Pearl characters I didn't see coming. The themes in the film have to do with the old missing their lost youth they took for granted. It's also about sexual repression vs. Hedonism, which was a generational difference since we are talking about the youth of the 70s here vs. Howard and Pearl, who grew up in a more conservative, religious environment. There is also the obsession with fame and wealth that every character working on the film is concerned with, especially Maxine. I only wish the director could have gone deeper with these themes, but it is a horror film first and foremost and there is only so much time to tell the story and get to the murders.The other critique I have is about Jenna Ortega's character Lorraine. I actually liked her character more than Mia Goth, the leading lady. But her character took a dumb turn once the action happens. I understand West had to do it this way, but I was still disappointed. By the end, Goth won me over and I was rooting for Maxine all the way.I will definitely be watching the prequel Pearl (even though I personally disliked her character) and the sequel MaXXXine when it comes out. Worth watching if you love horror!",2022-10-25
"It's usually the movies you watch without any expectation that surprise you the most. This is the case of X, a notable horror movie that I saw only because of my love of the genre and it gave me a pleasant surprise.Here three influences come together in a successful way: A sinister elderly couple as in The Visit by M. Night Shymalan. A rural setting in Texas in the 1970's with a group of young people living their lives with no strings attached like in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The world of pornography seen without prejudice by delving into the people who work in the industry and their motivations, as portrayed in Paul Thomas Anderson's film Boogie Nights.All of these well-inserted influences elevate the narrative and make this film more than just Slasher horror.The premise is apparently simple, a group of six people (three women and three men) from Houston, go to a country house to shoot a porn tape called: The Farmer's Daughter / La Hija del Granjero. Upon arrival, the producer who had made the deal over the phone runs into a grumpy-faced old man and his decrepit wife looking out the window.The director, Ty West, has dedicated his life to horror movies. Previously, the only thing I had seen of him is The Sacrament of 2013. In which he deals with the case of Reverend Jim Jones, founder of the People's Temple, an American sect that moved to Jonestown, Guyana with the promise of its leader Jones to found there ""The Terrestrial Paradise"". This happened in 1978. The outcome for the people who followed Jones was not what they hoped for.That film advances in a somewhat friendly way, bordering on a mockumentary tone as if it were a sociological study of desperate people who have nothing and who find there a sense of belonging and identity. Gradually in the last section of the film there will be a drastic change to a sinister tone that will transport us to an atmosphere of madness, manipulation and chaos.Something similar happens in X. Although we know that something sinister is hanging over the atmosphere, the entrance tone is lighthearted. With the use of beautiful omniscient overhead shots, image texture that resembles the Super 8 format in which porn was filmed, and effective zoom in and zoom out as resources to provoke the gloomy and delirious atmosphere that will arise at nightfall.While the young people freely enjoy their counterparts' bodies, the old woman lives frustrated by everything she stopped doing in her youth. The blood frenzy that occurs at dawn has disturbing scenes that will make even the most seasoned fan of the genre jump. No blood and gore just because. In the final stretch, all the traumas and bitterness that motivate the perpetrators are revealed. Knowing their motivations makes their actions more creepy because of the meanness they entail. Envy is the common thread of her atrocities.A horror story with substance, good characters, finely handled sex scenes and a satisfying ending as far as it goes.",2022-06-01
"I can't stop thinking about this film. This film was everything I wanted it to be and more. The grossness of the old couple were uncomfortable to watch (you know what part lmao), but it's horror so I don't expect to be comfortable the whole time. The pacing was really nice too, it was a slow build up but that left enough time and space for character development. Also there was a lot of things early on in the film which forshadows things to come, so it can be rewatched multiple times. The acting was amazing and the way the hair/makeup team transformed mia into pearl was CRAZY, she was unrecognisable. This was a ton of fun so please watch it if you can!",2022-04-29
This was a hard one to rate and I was truly conflicted. On one hand it was original and had some really creepy and creative scenes and moments. But on the other it tried a little too hard and was filmed in like the pitch black. I wish they fixed those things and this would have been even better. Still well worth the watch!,2022-06-16

"Slasher genre is saved and reinvented by Ti West. A disturbing, shocking and unbelievable film that filled with full of unexpected moments.As a big Mia Goth fan, I'm so happy that she's getting more roles these days and she did a fantastic job in this film by playing two characters that were so different and unique. Also I'm happy for Jenna Ortega and she needs to be in more movies.I can't wait for Pearl and Ti West's planned installments in this new slasher franchise.",2022-04-14

"X is probably the most overrated horror film I've seen this year, after hearing all the hype I was expecting something on the level of Barbarian and The Black Phone, but this wasn't even close.I was not invested in any of the characters at all besides the old people, who barely got any screen time until the 3rd act, X tried to be a throwback to old slashers while having an idiotic adult film plot, and it didn't work at all.Whoever thought making Maxine look exactly like the killer when she was young and then made a prequel about the killer when she was young starring Mia Goth who plays Maxine, was wilding, what a terrible idea that was.The music is haunting and the cinematography is great, and Jenna Ortega is always a delight, but the ending was just so unsatisfying that I can't help but give this movie anything more than what it gets.X gets a B+",2022-12-01
70s porn meets horror farm. It's chainsaw meets wicked old lady...raunchy and wicked. It's like a slasher - but a bit smarter and way less goofy. The ending that circles in the bible belt history is great.,2022-05-04
"This movie has a ton of clever little touches. They set up a cheesy 70s pornography aesthetic with wipe transitions and pretty decent 70s songs. The movie then blatantly references movies that abruptly change the plot halfway through with a Psycho reference. There are many thematic discussions in the movie. I never expected at all for the movie to focus so much on the sexuality of young people versus the sexuality of the elderly. It was also a bit distracting that the elderly woman was in old-person makeup. The theme seems to be that old people were the exact same as young people and have always liked sex? I found it more weird than good, but I suppose I don't regret seeing the movie.",2022-09-03
An ok slasher movie. Some subversion of expectations. I have seen better movies. This was dragging for long. I could have used the time I used to watch this movie watching something else.,2022-04-18
"One of the characters in X is determined to make a ""quality""porn movie, elevating the genre to proper cinema, reflecting Xs main idea of being a cinematic grindhouse flick. This translates to a slowly paced but visceral slasher style film high on nudity and ridiculously arty shots.This approach leads to characters you actually want to route for (one hypocritical douche aside) and a final third that feels even more entertainingly over the top given what's gone before. The cast are all excellent with Mia Goth anchoring the film superbly playing both the key roles. Props also on the casting of Jenna Ortega who's roles as the outsider of the gang is extra traumatising if you are old enough to have kids who watched her in Disney show Stuck in the Middle.X isn't for everyone, the glacial pacing may put off some traditional horror fans it may require too strong a stomach for many but it's a hell of a ride for those that stick with it.",2022-03-25
"I see this when it first released, i thought it was ok, but i didn't think it was anything special. Then I saw pearl, pearl added a lot to this, to her personality, why she had killed them all, or rather tried to in this case. Mia goth absolutely nailed the performances, as well as in pearl, she's fantastic. I first saw her in a lars von trier movie a while back, I think it was called nymphomaniac. Anyway, I recommend you watch this, as long as you either watch pearl first, or watch it right after. It is October, so nows a good time to watch some horror, and this is certainly where it's at. Overall 10/10 watch pearl first or right after.",2022-10-07
"Was quite different from what I expected, much slower and restricted. The first half was a great example of a movie being 'Slow but not Boring'. I was invested in the story and the characters, and the fact that cinematography is pretty great (throughout the whole movie) definitely helped. Tons of memorable shots.I expected the latter half / third act to be more tense considering the slowness of the first half. But the latter half continues the tone and pacing of the first half. I would've liked the movie more if it was more tense but liked the movie nonetheless. I should've kept in mind that this is an A24 film. Mia goth is the most impressive one among the cast.On a thematic level, X can be about a lot of things, but the main theme I think is the (many) desires of Old people. Them wanting to be young again: having sex and being attractive, fulfilling dreams they never got to achieve, etc. This is why I'm interested in seeing the Prequel, Pearl. I guess we'll learn what was her life like, and how she failed in achieving her dreams. The parallels between her and Maxine (both played by Mia Goth!) in terms of wanting to be famous / a star was very interesting.",2022-09-17
"Filmmakers like Tye West and S. Craig Zahler have brought new life into the horror genre. I so much admire and envy them. I wish I could be in their crew. Personally I really don't like mean and cruel horror films but somehow they breathe new life into them. John Carpenter, obviously an influential director among them. Also one of my favorites but failed when he became to campy and gross. I do love John Carpenter... feeling guilty to criticize.Tye West and S. Craig Zahler have tapped upon a level of horror that even Tarantino hasn't grasped. They are genius in their craft. And only get better with each film they make. I can't wait to see what the either of them make next. I thought horror was over before they came along. I'm a writer and so critical to a fault. They might not be perfect but they bring horror to life. And I thank them both for that.",2022-08-01
"X, 2022, 105 minutes. United States and New Zealand co-production directed by Ti West. In the cast, Mia Goth (Maxine), Jenna Ortega (Lorraine), among others.I really like horror movies.The film surprised me a lot, because it doesn't innovate anything, but it delivers a final result full of tension, massacre, deaths and action. Holds the attention. Maybe that's where the cat's leap of the script lies. On IMDb, the synopsis is perfect:
""In 1979, a group of young filmmakers set out to make an adult film in rural Texas, but when their lonely, elderly hosts catch them in the act, the cast finds themselves fighting for their lives.""
By adult film, understand pornographic film.All the clichés of a horror movie are present, as well as the most characteristic characters of a porn movie. There's the busty blonde addicted to sex, the virile black man with the huge dick, the innocent young woman who is starting in the world of porn movies, the exaggerated moans in sex scenes, the characters being alone in moments of tension and danger, the woman who swims naked in the lake, the fearless girl, the bad old men, a lot of screaming, someone always watching through the second floor window of the house, the macabre basement of the farmhouse, terrifying dreams, knives as instruments of murder, the need to go out and look for someone in the middle of the forest late at night, violent deaths with a lot of blood. And, as always, predictable ending, with the so-called ""final girl"", that is, there is only one woman left alive from the general massacre.The director handles such clichés very well, taking the opportunity to pay tribute to great horror and suspense films: Psycho, Halloween, Jaws, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre are visibly mentioned during the film. The aesthetic is 1970s, especially the pornographic film script and the use of colors. The actors do not stand out individually, but the ensemble is great, with a lot of synergy in the scene.Great introduction to the sex scene between the elderly couple. The visual citation of religion, especially Christianity, is constant throughout the film. A fine irony of the script.Perhaps the success of audiences and critics, with high marks on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb, can be explained by the fact that there is nothing supernatural about the story. All are people like us. The villains are mortal, flesh and blood, no one comes back from the dead, there is a bloodbath, with strong scenes (the death of the old lady is shocking) and the girl who survives is not left to be the poor thing, following her path to success , as can be seen from the television program that is tuned to the mansion on the farm, when the police arrive and see the massacre.And there is yet another ironic tone in the sheriff's final speech regarding the contents of the director's camera that was shooting the pornographic film.Smart movie, even using and abusing the most classic horror movie clichés.",2022-04-17
"Ti West is a visionary director who never disappoints, ""X"" is a masterpiece of horror cinema of the slasher subgenre. The script is quite good, full of intelligent dialogue, suspense and horror scenes that are masterfully brought to the screen by West. Tributes to various horror classics such as ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"", ""Halloween"", ""The Evil Dead"", among others, are easily appreciated. The cinematography together with the costume design and filming locations transport us to the seventies. The prosthetic effects are top notch and the gore is tremendous. The performances of the entire cast are very good, especially Mia Goth. So far, ""X"" is the slasher of the decade, just like ""Halloween"" was in the 70's, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" in the 80's or ""Scream"" in the 90's. An instant classic and possibly the best movie of its genre in this year 2022.",2022-05-27

I need my hour and a half of my life back. Nothing happens for over an hour. Then everyone turns into an idiot and gets killed for reasons. Your guess is as good as mine as to what those reasons are. Then it ends. Nothing scary happens. The gore is minimal. I guess we're supposed to be scared because old people are scary or something? This movie was just stupid and boring.,2022-04-16
"SCORE: 7.2/10This is new territory for me. I've never been one to watch straight up Horror, yet here we are. If I'm being honest, there were three reasons I wanted to go see this movie, and their names are Mia, Jenna, and Brittany. They did not disappoint one bit. I was equal parts scared and disgusted, maybe leaning more towards disgusted. But isn't that the point of Horror films? That's like going to an Action movie and saying they hit each other a lot like it's a bad thing. I did actually like how gruesome it was and there were a couple times that made my heart skip a beat, even with me closing my eyes to anticipate the jump scare. That's where the skill of Horror filmmaking comes in. They do everything they can to hit you when you least expect it and your guard is down. Sometimes you can predict it, but most of the time I was caught off guard. There were a couple scenes that I really wish I didn't see, but that's neither here nor there. The story had a cool premise, it was exciting, and the ending was great.""I wanna do a scene in the movie"". Whoever wrote that in and timed it that well was a genius. Suspense was done really well and the anti-climactic ending actually works. Of course the husband would die from a heart attack and the wife would fly half way across the house after shooting the shotgun, only to get run over and her head chopped off by the car. It was one of the handful of moments where I got a laugh out of what was happening. Also, Kid Cudi was Jackson? Like Day 'n Nite Kid Cudi? He was very good. Solid Horror flick.",2023-10-12
"The first hour sets you up for a 70's adult film and nothing horror film really ever happens. The next 45 minutes takes a turn and is really stupid, rather weird and absolutely ridiculous. Who thinks of these stupid movies. This wasn't even scary, not one bit of the movie was exciting or new or thrilling. Definite pass on this movie, it was boring and very dull.",2022-05-30
"This movie has everything it needs to keep a 14-year-old occupied for 2 hours; some steamy naked scenes combined with stupid gore. However as someone who has seen and done this all multiple times, it ends up being nothing but disappointment. I watched it till halfway and when the first kill happened in the most lazy and predictable way, I decided to call it.The pacing of this thing is way too slow to make it an interesting slasher thriller. The acting is exactly what you expect from an average porno. No dialogue, no cinematography. Ughh...
I'd personally recommend watching an actual porno rather than this, that might be more worthy of your time.",2023-03-02
"This is a good sed-up of 1970's horror sexplotation films. West wonderfully recreates the sexplotation during the early period heading to home video when porn movies were working to have story included with the sex. (Then it was overtaken and because just sex, sort of boring in my opinion, but I digress.) The horror comes later in the film with just hits of tension previous that don't build to much before the first kill happens. And then the ""craziness"" that unfolds isn't particularly clear other than it needed to happen for the film. The direction is excellent in creating the setting, the actors are excellent at completing the fictional world. But the film as a whole falls flat. West can be exceptional film making, and while his skills are on display here, the end product just falls flat. Let's see what Pearl brings to the story in the pending prequel movie.",2022-07-18
"The cinematography and vibe scream 70's, they stayed true to the aesthetic from beginning to end and I appreciate the old school cinematic moments.Was the over play of sex annoying? Absolutely, but again, it stayed true to the time the movie is trying to represent.I loved the acting, the kills were cool, it's a fun movie.",2022-07-02
"""X"" is for me a weird and interesting project that had tons of potential, but ended up to be predictable and pretty bland towards the end. The director did an excellent job in building up the tension in the first half of the film and there are a few sequences that made me a bit uneasy. I personally liked how Pearl and Howard were developed and the actors did a good job in portraying these old and crazy farm owners. To be honest they were the only two elements of the cast that really impressed me, the remaining members were just good enough. Unfortunately this movie ends up to be pretty bland: you can easily guess who is going to be killed and how, the ending is predictable from the very first few minutes. The killings are not even that creative and this film definitely misses any shocking value. I was expecting more gore and violence, because this is how this picture was marketed.As with most A24 films, the technical department is solid, the director did an excellent job in giving a 70s vibe to ""X"", but good photography and cinematography cannot compensate alone for a bland script. I liked the slow paced rhythm of the movie and I think that overall it can be a nice viewing for horror fans, so I would give it a try. I really hope that the director will fix the issues mentioned above in the prequel film that is set to be released this year.",2022-07-29
"Professionally-made horror films that have character development, are well acted, and have an original plot are hard to come by. I'm impressed in every category.",2022-04-20
"'X' was a nice mix of 70s-inspired sleaze, nudity, and gore. The soundtrack was also excellent.The first hour caught my attention. I enjoyed all the little details and some character traits. It sort of goes downhill after that. Most of the time, the kills didn't feel that great, and my interest was mainly held by the shock and disgust factor. Both done well.It had some interesting themes, some time period throwbacks, and overall felt more than a typical shock-inspired slasher in terms of characterization.Although a bit slow at times, I still think 'X' is a good experiment in subgenre mixing. No film is perfect, and neither is this one. The best thing was that it never felt too far in any direction, giving you a little of everything but twisted.Overall, 'X' is a better-than-slasher with questionable pacing and somewhat uninspired kills.",2022-04-26
"I try not to find out too much about a film before I watch it. No reviews (I know, I know), no trailers. Instantly with X though, I'm getting Texas Chainsaw vibes. It helps perhaps that we are in Texas. Rural Texas. The type of dangerous looking Texas, with searing heat and punishing sunshine. It also helps that we open on a scene with cops discovering a bloodbath massacre at a remote farm house. There's a sense that Texas cops have seen everything isn't there, that's the sense I get anyway. I've no desire to go anywhere near Texas from what I've seen on the big screen, but these cops are shocked. Where has all this blood come from, what's that axe doing wedged into the wooden porch and what made the fuzz utter those classic words ""Oh my god"" as they shone their torches around the basement. Rewind 24 hours to Maxine (Mia Goth) snorting coke in front of a dingy dressing room mirror. It's 1979 and she's an aspiring adult actress, making DIY porn with a small crew headed out into the sticks with the hicks. We already know things are going to go tits up, but there's no, 'I wonder who'll be first?' here. There's a genuine solid story to X to match the gore. Maxine wants to be a star. Bobby-Lynne (Brittany Snow) already thinks she is. They're all here on the promise that they'll hit the big time thanks to Wayne (Martin Henderson) the producer with a vision for the impending boom of VHS home porn. The odd one out is Lorraine (Jenna Ortega) who's working the sound for her boyfriend cameraman, DOP, wannabe auteur RJ (Owen Campbell). They're all free and fun-loving... but is backwater Texas? No don't be silly. It's a world of televangelists watching Bible belters and psychopaths. I watched Pearl earlier today, which I now realise is a prequel of sorts to this. An origin story of being trapped and psychotic on a farm between the world wars. I say of sorts as the timelines don't sync, but it'll become clear why. They pull up to an old farm house and it's hard not to keep pulling the narrative threads from 'Pearl' to this, but let's just say there are many. Including the farm where their host Howard lives. He's an old gnarly gun toting straight talking type that doesn't like them much, certainly not the only black person in the group, Jackson (Kid Cudi), but he's got a barn conversion for rent. One where they can stay and shoot porn, as long as he doesn't find out what they're up to. If the two parties keep to themselves maybe everything will be okay... but that's not going to happen now is it. Ti West has an eye for a good shot, good tone, perfect pacing and all are present here. Whilst the cheesy 70s porn is being shot, Maxine finds herself exploring the surroundings and the farmhouse, invited in by Howard's mysteriously eerie ghostlike wife, Pearl (Mia Goth in a lot of make up) and the story begins to twist. The potential depth here, works wonderfully with the shallowness of the sex and although it takes its time putting things into place, there's very little fluff and once Pearl reveals herself as the real deplorable danger, the blood begins to fly and we're off to the races. There's some great needle drops, the score is menacingly unnerving and the jump scares will set your teeth on edge. There are issues though, loose threads and the one thing it's lacking is reason. It's suggested, but I can see why Pearl now exists. I'm not sure if watching them backwards as I have helps or not, but I suspect it does. However I've a feeling it's more fun watching X first. It borrows a lot, from the aforementioned Texas chainsaw Massacre to The Shining, but it does it very well and despite wearing its horror credentials on its sleeve and foreshadowing events with that opening scene, it still keeps you guessing. Not least in the sex scenes, one of which is clearly designed to kill any viewers mood. X is not a great film, but it's a very good one. Easily becoming more than the sum of its bloodied parts, as it weaves a story of age and opportunities into a straight up slasher.",2023-05-08
"In 1979-based horror-thriller ""X"" amateur producer Martin Henderson takes Mia Goth & Jenna Ortega (two of Hollywood's hottest rising stars btw) with Brittany Snow, Kid Cuti & camerman Owen Campbell to make a porno on the remote farmstead of creepy corpse-like oldies Stephen Ure & (under heavy prosthetics) Goth again (!)... where slashing ensues! Like ""Death Proof"" (from Quentin Tarantino, whose early style writer / director Ti West tries aping in a pale imitation stylee) the first half that's rich in characters & performances (which are terrific) out-weighs the second half of all the gory 'action' - but overall it's an engaging watch, in its quirky kinda way.",2023-09-16

I wished it was a little easier to see.They also killed Kid Cudi without a lot of fanfare. I really was hoping for a better shot when he got killed.Overall a very good horror movie, definitely good to see.",2022-03-24
Well that was definitely something different. I felt like I had survived The House Of 1000 Corpses with a side of Chainsaw. Such a slow 70s good vibes to what became such a brutal Hills Have Eyes vibes. Lol lol nah forward to the prequel.,2022-07-24
"Still in awe of this amazing movie! This will definitely be a movie that stands the test of time. Brilliant cinematography and direction, and even more amazing cast that brought this to life. The shots alone are incredible to look at with vivid colours that are intriguing and tense scenes though out to keep you on the edge of your seat.Mia goth was truly amazing in this movie further show casing the power house she is! Finding out after the film that she played both parts is mesmerizing me even further and both me and my mom walked out wanting to watch the film all over again. The scene of the lake and crocodile will be in my head for weeks. Gorgeous film with the feel of classic 80's slasher Ti West should be Uber proud.",2022-03-20
"X feels like a vintage 1970s film, yet it is the most original and genuinely scary slasher in years. Awesome performances, a haunting score and witty writing make this film stand out amongst the rest. The kills are insane! Will definitely be watching this time and again. Great job, Ti West.",2022-03-19
"I get what they were trying to do, it looked and acted like a 70s horror movie, but not completely.. By a long shot. The movie concentrated more about their porn movie they were producing and characters stories, rather than ANYTHING to do with horror. So bored. Wasted time watching this. Also, I hate when they don't use an actual old person in old person movie roles, instead you get obvious 2 actors in ""old suits"" which make the tension and scare even less. Only reason for high scores has to be a scam. Absolutely hated this movie. Best part of whole movie was played by a crocodile.",2022-04-15
"Now horror films have a stigma of stupid people getting killed and I accept some of that. This one is one of the worst I've seen in the last decade or so for a bigger budget production.

"I had SUPER high expectations going into this film.... and damn was I disappointed. Let me start off with the good in this movie (very few) there was some decent visuals and kills in this movie. But other than that everything was a disaster. The performances in this movie were so mid, Kid Cudi needs to never step foot on a film studio ever again in his life. A lot of the dialogue in this movie is corny, I get it it's the 1980s but damn was I cringing at some of the dialogue. I hate to pick at little things, but the grandma looks to be pushing about 95 and with how little testosterone and libido you have at such a age, there's no way you're any way horny or have the urge to even get up and walk around at that age. I don't even think a 90 year old woman would have the strength to stick a knife in someone's throat. Overall, very overrated and disappointing.",2023-02-03
"Truthfully, I love how they shot the movie, but storywise, it wasn't new or fresh to me.I actually knew what was gonna happen, the first second of the movie. But I did love the beginning though. Great way to show the aftermath. The main characters, well....... I did feel for them getting killed, but did (& do) not enjoy their views of what they were doing. I was supporting Lorraine (jenni Ortega) but lost interest when jumped onto the ""party"" wagon. I did feel bad for her getting killed.I love the girl who did the dual role of Maxine & pearl. In a way, she was fighting herself 😁.But still, this movie was not my favorite.",2022-10-29

"I admire Ti West for going to the place where very few directors ever go. He managed to make a porno horror that was released in theaters. That alone is a goddamn acompleshment. Though the whole film all together is just kind of mid, you can tell there was work put into it and I admire that. I have to say the actors were pretty good and as a fan of Britany Snow, she did good. Was it gross that Jenna Ortega had only been 18 for like three months when this came out? Yes very much so. Also weird that the whole rest of the cast is ranging from 10-50 years older then her which once again is very weird, but if sex bothers you or gore, Im not sure why you would want to watch this movie but buyers be where. This is essentially just an high budget porno.",2023-02-16
I wouldn't call X a horror film because in my opinion it wasn't scary at all. To me it's more of a gory suspense film with nudity and ends with a twist. All the acting was superb especially by Martin Henderson and Brittany Snow. I highly recommend giving this film a try. It's very entertaining.,2022-03-26
"Everyone who is a horror aficionado should watch Ti West's ""X"", a creepy, suspenseful, near-flawless tribute to classic 1970s slasher films, with a dash of porn-culture hype, religious fanaticism, and unexpected character depth.Perhaps what is most surprising about the film is its deeply strange, yet interesting antagonists - an old, disheveled, mentally deranged, and physically grotesque couple. They are given a history where clear character motivations can be seen in the form of isolation and neglect, unfulfilled desires, and sexual depravity, which elevates the plot to a disturbing and spine-chilling homage. There is something wily, satirical, and humorous about the way director West approaches not only these villains, but also its perverted porn actors - all who fall into familiar, silly horror tropes, but seem to be having so much fun fulfilling these roles.And lastly, the film is extremely well shot switching between retro graininess, low-lit long shots, and gruesome, gotcha close-ups. Well-worth a watch for its clever reimagining of films like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""The Last House on the Left"".",2023-01-04

"This has everything you'd expect from a 70s slasher about a group of adult filmmakers. Had no idea where the story was going but I was pleasantly surprised by the final outcome. The script was clever, the acting was fine, the kills delivered, the aesthetic was perfect. Top tier slasher film.",2022-05-24
"X needs some time to start up but once that first hour of slow burn is through it keeps up it's pace fairly well. Whilst I expected more, It got enough weird for me to be alright with the movie, though it tries a little too much. And an aspect of it never works. It's still a solid slasher horror.Directing is great, though it gets notably more boring towards the end. Fairly uninteresting shots. Music is fairly good nothing too notable though. Acting is good all around the board, Brittany Snow being the standout performer.The plot/story is easy to get, but I had massive issues with the make-up of the old couple in this movie, mainly the wife. Which made it feel like I was watching Bad Grandpa. It wasn't ever convincing. And you could tell they were ''acting'' old and just moving in slow motion. The old man didn't suffer from this as the actor was older, so the transformation wasn't massive. But the wife always felt fake. Making her scenes off putting. That said, I appreciate the original take on a horror movie.Kills and gore are really good. They are brutal. And it's all very well done. Not super excessive, not comical. Except one shotgun scene which was hilarious.",2022-11-19
"A tribute as well as a fresh-spin on classic slasher and horror movies, X brings together familiar genre tropes while incorporating various strange and arthouse elements that give this film a striking feel that helps it stand out from its mainstream counterparts. It tells the story of a group of young adult film crew and actors who travel to a reclusive elderly couple's remote farm residence to shoot a movie in secret, but things quickly turn deadly come nightfall when the owners start to find out what their new guests have been up to.What I particularly liked about this film is that it is patient in taking the time to develop its characters and to build up the tension before unleashing the inevitable carnage. For a large portion of the film, you don't even realize you are watching a slasher movie, but you can tell something sinister is brewing in the background constantly, and you are just waiting for the fateful moment that it boils over. There are some very cool shots and film sequences throughout the movie with long takes, birds-eye view angles, as well as cutting back-and-forth between events in the real world and the movie the crew is currently shooting to enforce a story-within-a-story dynamic. When the killing does start the violence is impactful and disturbing but never overdone, and the movie also finds ample opportunities to sneak in some comedic relief here and there which I appreciate. Furthermore, I want to highlight the top-notch acting from everyone involved and some awesome popular music inserts and the soundtrack.One thing that I wanted a bit more from the movie, it would be to explore deeper into the history and the motivation of the killers. From some of the actions and dialogues that were peppered throughout the story, it is already hinted that the villains are not your average chainsaw-wielding mask-wearing maniacs but rather folks that have an emotionally-charged reason that are driving them in their heinous deeds which are more than just random killings. I just wished the story spent more time on that, as currently it just ends up being a good ol' slasher movie when it had the potential to be something deeper and more special. Other than that, the movie also falls victim to some trite and clichéd tropes like silly jump-scares that it could've done without and some rather bland and predictable killings toward the end.Overall, a very solid entry into the slasher genre that I'm sure will satisfy people both looking for blood and gore as well as something a bit more on the indie/artsy side of things. A24 has done it again so definitely don't miss this one out if you are a fan of horror.",2022-04-15
"X has pretty much everything you might expect - sex, nudity and gore.It is heavily influenced by classic horror slashers, especially THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE.No spoilers here, but if you're reading this you likely already know the basics. A group of pornographic filmmakers go to an isolated farm house to make a movie. Yes, that kind of movie.The sex scenes put the X in the title and they don't hold back. All three of the leading ladies engage in a soft core version of the hardcore porn!Probably the most surprising thing, is that what PITCH PERFECT'S Brittany Snow ends up wiping off her back in clear view of the camera.It is a bit of a slow burn before the slashing starts happening, but when it gets there, it is unexpected and wild fun.",2022-12-18
"I didn't enjoy this movie a slightest. We didn't get any information of any characters. I do not even remember anyones name. Movie was dull and dumb and not scary at any point. Maybe it was a bit disturbing but I just didn't care what happened. There was almost no plot and it was really foreseeable. In each scene I said what was gonna happen and that was exactly what happened. In some weird way the movie was like made by me because I knew everything. Music score was unmemorable instead of Blue Oyster Cult's song in one particular scene. All the interesting things like how should one think about their wife getting interested to be in adult industry or being old and not getting any sex anymore were skipped totally. Those subjects would make a good movie but this was just atterly nonsense and modern ""horror"" that i would call maybe a thriller.",2023-01-26
"Pros.It has some decent gore
Mostly good acting
Lots of 70s horror Easter eggs/references
Martin Henderson doing what has to be the best Matthew McConaughey impression I've heard in a long time (seriously I really expected him to say ""alright alright alright)
The early Eaten Alive nod and final payoff are both hugely effective
Really solid soundtrackCons.It's very slow to get started. And not in the gradual suspenseful build up of tension sense, but that very little happens for close to an hour.Despite wanting to be a really smart horror, the film still falls into the standard tropes of characters being morons who make dumb decisions and doesn't really bring anything original to the table besides better quality (but not perfect) cinematography
When the carnage begins, the lighting gets very dark and sometimes obscures the shots and detail which may be a creative choice but does somewhat reduce the enjoymentOverall, very decent but not a game changer
Worth watching.",2022-06-12
"It's true. There is nothing redeemable about these people or characters. In movie or real life. I found myself rooting for their destruction. I of course already know that the little spanish girl will probably be the only survive and will be a super kick ass powerful wahmen. See, these movies aren't original or even good. They are idiotic, art house shlock. Pure sewage. Don't waste your time on this. Anyone who likes this is probably on multiple medications and weak. In mind and body.",2022-04-17
"But it isn't. This is taken seriously and was released as such. Nothing else would tell you otherwise with the marketing. If it was going for the tongue in cheek approach it failed miserably. People see the film studio here and expect something which it is not and honestly don't think anyone would necessarily want anyway. With I'm sure so many MeToo progressive women working for Rotten Tomatoes it's hilarious that they liked this film so much. Obviously based off of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre films and other slasher films of the 70's and 80's minus any of the artistry or awesome campiness of those films,this film was just a pretentious mess.",2023-06-24
"'X' is a 2022 horror film from writer/director Ti West who has pretty much made his name executing horror films like this. The only film of his I recall seeing is 2009's 'The House of the Devil' which was an interesting although not really mind blowing horror flick. 'X' stars Jenna Ortega, Mia Goth, Brittany Snow and Martin Henderson. The film evokes 70's era horror films especially 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. 'X' was shot in New Zealand and supposedly had a prequel film shot simultaneously along with it that is supposed to be released in the near future.Martin Henderson is a porn producer in 1979 and in order to save a few bucks he rents out a rural farmhouse to use as a shooting location so him and his handful of stars and crew which total 6 including him head out to this remote farm to film their movie. The kid he has hired to shoot it wants to make art while the actors involved are under no such illusions. Once at the farm we learn there is an elderly couple who live in the main house who seem reclusive and not too friendly. The wife of the farmer, Pearl, is portrayed by Mia Goth in prosthetic makeup who also plays one of the young porn actresses. As shooting commences Pearl notices what is going on and is drawn to the young people. She seems flighty and senile, but the cautious, curious old lady turns deadly as she suddenly starts murdering the young people one at a time in grisly fashion. The husband also takes part in the killing and it seems this is somewhat of a staple activity for them luring groups to the farmhouse and then dispatching them. In classic horror film fashion they are dispatched one by one unbeknownst to the rest of the crew until it is too late, and thus it becomes that classic horror trope of who will be left and well they survive this odd farm of horrors.As a horror film it is not without is charm. It has its fair share of bloodthirsty kills which is always what you crave in a good horror flick. I am uncertain if I like it for the lack of any explanation or if I feel the odd, sadistic behavior should be explained in some fashion. Either way the lack of any motives or explanations make the narrative very tight as the film moves along quickly. I do feel, rather than homage, the film leans a bit too much on 'Texas Chainsaw' as a guiding influence. I also enjoy that the film has a very female dominated narrative. So often in slasher films they can be construed as male sexual fantasies based in violence against women yet in this film the violence is predominantly instigated by the women which is a fun change of pace. It is tough to make a truly great, original horror film especially if you hew to the slasher genre. This film does a good job in putting forth an interesting little horror film and thus it gets a modest thumbs up for being entertaining, but it isn't doing anything to really push the boundaries of the genre or make anything truly original and therefore all it can achieve is that modest thumbs up.Eric's Grade: C+",2022-07-09
"It's been awhile since I watched a horror, so I've been excited for this one. It immediately gives off original Texas Chainsaw Massacre vibes with its setting, but it adds it's own twist with the porn storyline.X has a a bit of an odd cast, with Jenna Ortega who is establishing herself as this generations scream queen (no pun intended), Pitch perfect Brittany Snow in a drastically unexpected role, and rapper Kid Cudi who seems to fancy himself as an actor instead of a rapper these days.This film is creepy, in a very uncomfortable way which adds to the tension even before the killing finally begins an hour in.The old age makeup on Mia Goth is incredible, the camera shots are very cool too and it has blood and gore without being over the top.Not exactly what I expected, but a good film nonetheless.",2022-04-15
"I first want to start off by giving props to the camera crew for the extraordinary camera angles and panning. It was so well executed and extremely enthralling! In addition, I liked the foreshadowing in the beginning, making the element of horror and suspense almost instantaneous. The old fashioned setting and small scale camera framing in a few of the shots was super creepy and unsettling. I asked a few of my friends what they thought about the film, and I got mixed reviews. One thought it was anticlimactic (-) that there was so little build up and not much of a climax to keep his attention. While another loved it mainly because Jenna Ortega was starting in it. Ultimately, it was compelling to see these actors take on a rather unprecedented project to make a successful adult film that would later turn into a slasher film full of sheer terror and gore. Looking forward to seeing the prequel ""Pearl"".",2022-09-18
Didn't expect much. Paid homage to classic 70's horror movies. Unlikeable characters that were given sufficient depth to make you care enough to not want them to be the next kill which made it refreshing. A little too gorey in parts for me but a well shot movie none the less. Cannot understand for the life of me why they didn't just cast older people as the central characters though. Just pointless having younger actors in prosthetics for the sake of it. Would have been much better if they just cast older aged actors. A simple yet fun movie that was original enough but with clear nods to some of the classics from the past.,2023-02-04
The slasher genre has never really done it for me. Always felt corny with jump scares and repetitive story.But with X it really felt like Ti West was making this movie for me. For the people who are over those clichés. He did the perfect blend of aesthetic with good acting and a pretty original motive for the killers.He also threw in so many iconic lines that were teased at the very beginning and brought back at the very end.Mia Goth is incredible for that double performance. Will definitely be watching everything she puts out from here.,2022-03-23
"When I saw the trailer for X, I was highly anticipating this horror picture and it still blew my mind. While it is a bit of a slasher film, it is by no means a traditional piece in the sub-genre. So many different perspectives are offered and the audience is able to empathize with every character in some way or another, including the antagonists. The approach to the world of pornography is intriguing as we see people with true passions, whether cinematic or sultry and its presence isn't gratuitous or particularly offensive. The dialogue is well-written and executed. Each cast member perfectly portrays their character. It feels like a documentary at times, which proves how effortlessly this film inserts you into its world. There are, at times, gruesome kills that genuinely frighten and hold emotional power with a beautiful color scheme and wonderful cinematography to match. The editing paired with directing, at times, is slightly jarring, but never enough to pull you out of the film. X is an instantly charming and ultimately memorable adventure of a film.",2023-02-20
"Horror movies aren't my thing but it was a slow night. I like this film- it has a bit of everything- a story, suspense, gore, a tiny bit of comedy. Expect to be entertained, not mesmerized. It's not a highly intellectual film.Also don't watch if you're offended by nudity or blasphemy! It's not for everyone !Overall I liked it.",2022-03-30
"I was actually surprised that I ENJOYED this Ti West Horror, after watching the preview months ago, and thinking, Oh NO, another torture porn Gorefest!!But, seeing so many reviews and decent overall score (which sadly, you can't always trust number scores). I decided to watch it.I'm a 70's kid, who was 14 in 79, and in the Weeds!. LOL So the vibe of this movie, the Fabulous Soundtrack, the actually very likable characters made this a fun story. I loved the cinematography, and the aerial shots, of that lake. LOL :O.And the beautiful Rendition of Stevie Nick's 'Landslide' by Brittany Snow. With those split screen shots, was just kinda heart breaking. It sucks to get Old.It's slow paced, like 70's horror I love (Original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Other, Burnt Offerings). But the acting and likable characters and cinematography with great placed sound track, lured you in to their world. It didn't feel so Over the top Fake, like so many horror movies these days.And the amount of sex scenes, considering this is a movie about a 1979 low budget porn shoot, (which is now called soft porn) Really didn't show much more than you see in a PG 13 movie these days, except for the few seconds of male frontal.So the sex and the horror were NOT over done, but it sure was creepy, especially toward the end with the bed scenes. LOL GROSSS!!! So SCARY!!!So if you wanna blaze one up and sit back an enjoy an old school 70's horror with a bit of sex and gore, then you may well enjoy this movie.If your here for Hardcore Sex and Gore, then head to Porn Hub or some other internet sex site. Or for gore go watch Saw, Hostel, Midnight Meat Train. Because you won't be liking this movie.Overall, pretty well done and a fun watch. I think the Real Siskel and Ebert would have given this 2 thumbs up back in the day! ;D.",2022-05-01
"I didn't expect something like this. Slow. Intense. Nothing to it when you think about it but give it a time you will find hole new meaning to this movie.. Great story, good acting and great execution... If you are not fan of blood don't watch it... If you are a fan of good horror movie please do watch it... Simply it like Texas Chainsaw Massacre meet Wrong Turn sprinkle in some I Spit on Your Grave in good way...",2022-04-14
"The movie is.. A OKAY I guess? The shots are beautiful and you definetely feel the director putting in the work in the scenes and the dialogues.However judging the movie as a whole it's not as interesting as some of its parts, feels like it tries too much while not having enough.1. The villains. Usually in slasher you have some unstoppable force as a villain with no known motives and limits, here you have some 80 years old with heart problems. In some ways they're the protag, the superhero of the show, wether Jason, Freddy, etc... So they need to be strong in presence. This impossible premise makes the film void of any intense horror. It does make for an interesting scene in the end but I don't feel like it's worth the trade.2. Also using old and horny as the key element to creating horror is quite weird, especially when you finished the film and refelct upon it. LGBT or anything are taboo nowdays but heh look how old people and old skin are scary, eh? A lot of the scare are too based solely on the premise of villain being old and have bad skin, it's okay to have them, but I need something more than that.A side note I can't realisticly fanthom being that horny in eighties, or are they younger than that?3. It's basically half a slasher, because everything starts around midpoint where there's even some meta comment that are quite fitting. First half starts too slow, and really is not setting up the second part properly, alas when it comes down to the second part you only have half the run time so some scenes and kills don't have the time to breathe and ended up rushed.",2022-04-17
"The film gets so many things right. The characters weren't shallow, the 70s mood seems indescribably legit, the chills/gore, acting, sound, everything about West's visions works.",2022-06-08
"X is a 70's horror story surrounding a group filmmakers who want to make porn movie on a Texas farm. The group headed by Martin Henderson, Jenna Ortega, Mia Goth, and Brittany Snow are caught in the act by their elderly hosts when all hell breaks loose and each one is picked off one at a time. The movie plays tribute to some of the great horror movies of the time. This was less of a horror movie but rather a soft porn movie with a small cast of characters. The creepy owners have not had much action and the older lady tries to recollect the days when she was young and hot. Overall it was an okay movie to watch once, nothing scary to report.",2023-01-29
"In 1979, a production team rent a farm from an elderly couple to shoot an adult video but not any old adult video, a classy one that will change the industry because it has a good story and strong cinematography.X might sound like a B level horror movie with sex, violence and gore but like the adult video they are shooting - the movie is much classier than the average slasher that might try and seduce you with gore alone. It's well shot, well acted and it has a serious tone about it. You'll find names from Scream, Pitch Perfect and Don't Look Up in the cast.Overall It's enjoyable and introduces a different take on the slasher genre even whilst using classic horror tropes. It also manages to throw in some wider themes to think about alongside the main narrative.X is 1 hour and 45mins long and would definitely be classed as a slow burn with the 1st half setting the scene... but once the action starts it sustains itself until the end.Would recommend to fans of the Horror and Slasher genres.",2022-03-30
"This movie was like any other genres couldn't do to make many people famous when it comes to the early 70s which it did take place during 1979!Mia Goth did such a beautiful job and Jenna Ortega slay that role, and Brittany Snow who was in Pitch Perfect was marvelous with her role! I mean you got to give credit to these wonderful actors who have done their part.Writer and director Ti West did a pretty solid job with the dialogue that took place in 1979 and they made it look like your traveling back in time to the 70s, it'll probably bring you back to the cinemas where you could actually sit through a movie and enjoy the fun out of it in the 70s.",2023-03-08
"I must say I really enjoyed this film. It didn't feel like one of those trashy adult horror movies that were too mediocre. X really has a simple plot with an interesting set of characters, but what sets it apart was the setting of the film and classic approach to slasher horror movies. Plus the gore scenes were wonderfully executed.",2022-05-05
"I've been following Ti West since House of the Devil, and this is the closest he's gotten back to that. Not that it's important to be in the same vein as a past work but I loved that movie, and I LOVED this movie. First of all it's gorgeous, what he's done with the light and color and shadow is incredible, you are IN 1979 watching a movie about 1979. You could watch it with the sound off and still be captivated. Everyone was good, but I was so happy to see Martin Henderson, 20 years since The Ring and he has only gotten better, easily the best male actor. Brittany Snow was perfect, but Mia Goth worked her behind off in this one. Her character is part Roller-Girl and part Sydney Prescott, but Mia was in the Suspiria remake, which I also loved, and after she must have thought, ""one day I'm gonna out-Tilda Tilda,"" and she did her damndest to accomplish that in this one. Hopefully this is her breakout. I thought it was a *good* movie, until they get to the part where Jenna Ortega says THE THING, and then it became a GREAT movie, bravo, everyone.",2022-07-15
"The meat of the movie was mock porn. I had high hopes because A24 puts out bangers usually, but this was stagnant and cliche. The actors were all really great, but the writing just completely sh/t the bed. The plot is so muddy. I was really excited to be weirded out but it ended up just being so pathetically sad. It definitely uses a few visual shock factors and some very campy and cliche death scenes. I spent the first hour of the movie wondering when it would start to get scary and the last 30 minutes confused as hell. Like I said, all the actors did great, but the makeup effects and the writing really truly fell short. I would never rewatch this. If you want a great scary movie, go watch Barbarian. Infinitely better.",2022-10-29
The movie was okay but when the old lady gets mad about them not wanting to do her it threw me off a bit cause like wtf and then her husband helps killing all the people who don't wanna do her kinda weird for my taking...,2022-04-25
"4/10. The movie might be considered ""good"" as far as slashers films go but overall kinda boring and lack luster.The aesthetic was great, they nailed the 70s style, Mia Goth was an excellent choice. But overall? Not super impressive.Is it worth the $4 to rent on Amazon? Sure, you will still be entertained but you probs won't be on the edge of your seat, biting your nails.I'm still interested in watching the upcoming prequel, I think Ti West had some great ideas with this film, style was excellent. Willing to give this potentially franchise another chance. I plan on lowering my expectations though.",2022-09-28
"Best horror movie of the decade. Instant cult classic. Ti West direction is excellent (as always) of a wonderful refreshing simple script. Clever, fresh and slight homage to 70s horror with a very 22 take. Just loved it.",2022-04-19
X has an X factor for sure. It's haunting and gore in an equal level placing it higher in the shelf. Distinct characters masterfully shot scenes and the intensity is remarkable. Story is detailed and it's thorough. Saving the major the twist for it's conclusion is a sign of mastery tpo.,2022-06-25
Going back to an old style of horror ironically makes this feel quite original in today's landscape of CGI and nonsense.Very nicely done indeed.More film makers should take note that simple is often better.,2022-04-26
"X is a superior horror movie. Clearly borrowing from the territory of Texas Chainsaw Massacre it manages to, nevertheless, be refreshingly original.The premise is this. A (relatively) young young bunch of hipsters head out into the Texas countryside in 1979 having booked a cabin on a ranch in which to stay.Their mission? To create a porno (or adult film as it was called in those days).Upon arrival (and becoming apparent from a stopover at a petrol station that they are in Bible Belt and that sort of thing is not approved of) they are confronted by the owner of their accommodation. He's very, very old and has an itchy trigger finger on his shotgun and appears to have forgotten the transaction (it was pre airbnb days).His (hidden) wife is even older, but it transpires she seems to have a taste for a bit of jiggy jiggy and soon enters the fray in a quite unexpected way.Much carnage (and a fair bit of nudity) follow but it's funny in a way and it's nice to see 90 + year old serial killers getting their moment in cinema.It's shot really well and Mia Goth is terrific in the lead.Netflix. Recommended.",2022-12-28
"I really wanted to like this film. I guess I am disappointed, but this film just let me down. It's not terrible, Ti West is too good for that it's just it didn't hit me. I found the old couple silly and very unconvincing. The scene where Maxine inside the old woman's house for lemonade. That scene went nowhere, explained nothing. Jackson's off screen death...what?? The filmmaker is really upset because his girlfriend wants to participate in the film? You didn't see that possibility? Come on, lame! I know many liked the film. To each their own. I didn't hate it, but I didn't like it. Just a let down.",2023-05-17
"A black sheriff in 1970's Texas.... It never happened. Decent film but character placement is ludicrously way off. Re-writing history is prevalent these days, however having a black sheriff in Texas in the 1970's makes the film wokery in motion.",2022-06-23
"A cliche slasher movie again. Tried to make a difference but it didn't work. I like acting. Especially Mia Goth. I love her. Too long for me. Bored a little bit. In short, I didn't hate it but didn't like it very much either.",2022-03-20
"I will preface this by saying that I never went to film, and I've never made a film. I simply enjoy watching movies. Horror is one of my favorite genres. But I could not watch this movie. Because it was too dark. Literally. There is no lighting. I couldn't see much of what happened in the movie. There were entire scenes where I had no clue what was going on because there was virtually no light.Other than not being able to see 75% of the movie, I liked the visible parts. Just wish I could've seen the rest of the movie.",2022-04-17
I quite enjoyed it! A mix of Texas chainsaw and eaten alive . Maybe a dash of motel hell too. But it's certainly it's own thing. Loved the editing. Tense and creepy and ridiculous and gory. Also liked the characters and no one felt like like throw away. Can't complain really aside from I felt the ending was leading to something bigger but I was still satisfied. It's oddly tender too. Absolutely worth checking out!,2022-03-20
"I haven't kept up with mumblegore wunderkind Ti West's output since The Innkeepers, which I thought worked really well as a sort of indie comedy about two aimless thirtysomethings but fell completely flat as a horror movie. X continues along that downward trajectory by completely lacking in suspense and atmosphere and also having a cast of bland stock characters.The only potentially interesting person in the group is Jenna Ortega as Lorraine, who seems to be standing in judgment of the other characters until she decides to join in with them. But as with most slashers, you can't really get invested in anyone besides the final girl because they're all going to get killed anyway, so their hopes and dreams and personalities are completely incidental and you know it.The sinister old characters are boring, too. From the moment they show up, you know what their whole deal is, and your perceptions never change, so it becomes pretty boring to watch them go through the motions. I kept waiting for some kind of reveal, some depth of character, but nope. They're just psychotic old hillbillies.(""But that's what the prequel is for,"" you argue. ""To flesh out the character of Pearl and explain her backstory."" BS. The only thing worse than a boring movie is a boring movie that only exists to get you to buy a ticket to another boring movie. I really need filmmakers and authors to stop making work that only serves as a commercial for their next work. Make things entertaining on their own.)Why the period setting? There doesn't seem to be any reason, except as an excuse to steal some shots from Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Why the porno storyline? It doesn't seem like Ti West really has anything to say about the sex industry, or sex itself. It's not really just an excuse for T&A, either, since the sex scenes are shot to be either funny or creepy, but never sexy. I wouldn't mind the porno simply serving as a MacGuffin to get these characters to the isolated location where they'll be slaughtered, except that the movie spends SO MUCH time on it: characters shooting scenes, characters talking about shooting scenes, characters doing drugs to get up the nerve to go shoot the scenes. With all this attention paid, It seems like this porno is really building up to something. And then it doesn't. Why is this movie over 100 minutes?The most damning thing I can say about X is that it casts Mia Goth, who I think is quite a special actress, in dual roles, and then gives her absolutely nothing of interest to do in either of them.",2022-10-03
"Just taking the time to write: ""It sucked"" is more effort than this movie deserves, it was boring, uneventful, crappy writing and acting, hopefully I'll keep others from wasting $5.99 on the rental...",2022-06-19
"I do not see how there needed to be this amount of nudity for a horror flick, full of plotholes and just akward to watch with anybody else.What especially surprised me is that Jenna Ortega was in this movie, another child actor gone bad resulting in rebellion in the form of whatever this is. Not sure why so many child actors decide to make movies like this since these will often overshadow their previous; more respectable history.Its also just too funny to me that somehow this mumified woman is killing everybody when she cant even stand up on her own two feet.The only good thing in this movie was the practical effects.",2022-04-17
"""X"" is an odd, almost intentionally off-putting homage to '70s/'80s Slasher tropes, designed to induce a queasy sense of self-conscious dread. I think most people have either forgotten or are too young to remember that sensation while watching a horror film --- and half the fun of this movie is watching West play with and ultimately turn these by now ancient tropes on their heads.Ti West's films always polarize audiences in general, usually more die-hard old-school horror fans lean more towards them, as they rely more on suspense than shock value. If you're used to the clockwork jump scares and overly amped sound mix stings of most modern horror films, you probably won't like it. There's really only one such JS (well done), and another with no ""sting"" on the audio, because it's so obvious a set-up, almost as if West is mocking the jump-scare trope, in general.""X"" follows a group of rag-tag pornographers, mostly culled from a low-brow Texas strip club (seen briefly in the opening) whose producer (Martin Henderson) has his eyes locked on the burgeoning home video market of the early '80s. Henderson's performance is actually the weakest of the lot, hung more on aw-shucks self-parody --- his lines come off more like a circus barker and it seems at times that the actor *needs* us to like the character (WHY?).They take off for the sticks in a cargo van (one of many ""Texas Chainsaw"" refs) minus windows and psycho hitcher and come to a large pastoral farm on the outskirts of Houston owned by two crotchety oldsters, intending to conceal their free location grab, though things don't go as planned, of course.Thankfully, the rest of the cast acquits themselves nicely, and their back-stories resonate with thoughtful authenticity. The casting of Brit Mia Goth in the lead is a good, albeit daring move, given her Maxine plays (again) as something of a self-parody. When Henderson says she has that ""X factor"" you kind of just shake your head. It's not Goth that's the problem, but the character she's playing, though West is again toying with our expectations. Maxine's caked-on blue eyeshadow and overly studied line readings in the ""film within a film"" play as tragedy more often than not. Brittany Snow and Jenna Ortega, by contrast, seem to be having five times the fun in comparison and their energy is badly needed. Ortega lets loose with what is probably the Best Scream that I've seen/heard in twenty years (wrenching and heartbreaking at the same time) and Snow's death scene is priceless and expertly executed in the effects department.At about the mid-point you know the carnage is coming and each kill delivers something a little more off-putting than you expect --- a tad more gore and suffering, maybe a strange angle or creepy lighting effect added to the mix. It's definitely a horror film for people who enjoy the nuances of film --- literally none of the frames play as haphazardly planned or shot.And the ending pulls out a nice twist (and delivers what is the funniest final Tarantino-esque line of a horror film I've seen, maybe ever) to make it worthwhile.There's a lot going on in ""X"" at the sub-textual level --- most specifically with the ""you have wanton sex, you gotta die!"" saw. But even that is not slung around thoughtlessly. It actually makes some subversive statements about personal choices and consequences of lives lived or unlived without getting too moral high-horsey.It's a nice balancing act of thriller and homage that takes some time to appreciate, distinctly absent of any and all cheap thrills. But if you've seen and liked West's ""House of the Devil"" and ""The Innkeepers"", two earlier works that rely almost entirely on their build-up for effectiveness --- it's safe to say you'll like ""X"". Even ""The Sacrament"" (which had as many lows as highs) still built suspense and dread as few horror films bother to do any more. And that's the main reason I continue to follow and enjoy Ti West.",2022-07-24
"Saw the trailer on YouTube, some of the reviews online and that it had Kid Cudi in it and decided to give it a try.I enjoyed the movie. I didn't really find it as gross and disturbing as many people are saying it is, I've seen worst in more major horror movies. The premise is a little ridiculous but no more than a blind man or a killer doll going on a murder spree.Seen that there was a trailer for the prequel after the credits and I wouldn't mind seeing that either to get more backstory on the elderly couple.",2022-03-21
"Watching it I thought build up way too long, for a horror(presumably) they tried and failed. This isn't Hitchcock build up to something. Clever writers and directors can make a film. No scares just a boring film with horror being replaced by horrific acts by humans, being bad people. I love a scare you won't find it here. What has happened to the horror genre? Where is the the new Nightmare on Elm Street, even Gremlins is scarier than this. I think maybe studios believe we like to watch personal struggles and throw them out as Horror. I wish I'd like it but unfortunately it just wasn't scary enough, but thought it would be sadly.",2022-10-15
"This is the 25th 'psychological horror' title from A24, or so I thought. In reality, it's a pompous script that relies on tired tropes with the veneer of an art film, but none of the substance.It's hard to describe how bad this film is - don't be fooled by the cinematography (some great shots there, some paying homage to the classics, some genuinely inventive). The cinematrography is what hurts the most: they had the talent, the actors, the budget to do something amazing.Instead, they created a post-modern slasher flick that is as pretentious as it's light on ideas. You can almost smell the caviar and petit four at the launch party, mocking the 'little people' who didn't understand how great this film was.PS: potentially the worst ending of any non-ironic films out there to boot.Watch something good instead, like ""hereditary"", also by A24 and far, far,.. no - infinitely better.",2023-09-16
"The movie was scary for the wrong reasons:
Scarily predictable jump scares and deaths which are very predictably foreshadowed.Scarily odd makeup making the old people look like fake ghostly figures, which made their human ""interaction"" scarily uncomfortable to watch.Scarily weak plot development, even though the original setting is fun. Motive for the old people going on a rampage? Jealousy? Seriously?Scarily cliché behaviour of protagonists getting picked off one by one, felt like someone dug through a ""How to make a horror movie 101"" handbook and wrote down every classic move.Overall felt like a waste of time and I got bored halfway throughout, skipping ahead and such. Shame, given the scarily favourable reviews.",2022-10-27
"While the whole cast is wonderful, it's Brittany Snow who steals the show as the fun-loving porno queen prone to Stevie Nicks musical interludes. Ti West has been given a slightly larger budget to play with this time and he makes great use of it, milking every location for maximum atmospheric impact.",2022-04-27
"This movie, about a group of young filmmakers who set out to make an adult movie in rural Texas, is an okay beginning of The X Trilogy (2022-).First of all, I think the actors were great. They were quite convincible, and they managed to make some sort of connection to me. I had no idea that Mia Goth played both Maxine Minx and Pearl, which really proves how well the makeup was done! The cinematography was great as well. Its vintage-like color palette with excellent lighting and the camera motion created appealing visuals that helped making the movie's atmosphere.The movie had some good scenes in the beginning despite the slowness, and things seemed slowly stranger and stranger after when the main characters had arrived at the farm. This created a certain suspense, and it really got my interest. Pearl was interesting to begin with, and it felt strange when she expressed her own sex drive while dreaming of becoming young again, which she apparently had lost, according to what she said. She suddenly went to unusual places around the farm, and a couple of characters started to notice, which obviously turned out bad from here.The second act was the disappointing part to me. It was quite flat and non-dynamic, which gave me some boring feeling sometimes. There were only unimportant dialogues, and too much sex, even though it was one of the big themes of this movie. The final act was decent itself, but I think it got some negative influence by the second act, which didn't really fulfill my enjoyment. Pearl wasn't that scary anymore, I think, and therefore I felt that I wanted more of something else. I just expected more. I think the main reason is that Pearl opened herself too much for us, which made me feel compassion of course, but because of that, while she was the antagonist, she lost that antagonist factor.In conclusion, while the movie showcased strong performances, impressive cinematography, and an intriguing setup in its first act, it faltered in the second act, lacking dynamism and meaningful dialogue. The initial suspense and eerie atmosphere gradually diminished, and the antagonist's impact weakened. Despite its decent final act, the negative influence of the second act dampened overall enjoyment. Expectations for a more compelling resolution were left unfulfilled. Ultimately, the movie's potential was hindered by a narrative imbalance, preventing it from fully delivering on its promising premise.",2023-05-28
"It started out good with a great setup. After the first kill, i felt like this could be really good, but unfortunately the rest went down quickly with lack of creativity.This is clearly a fun, tongue in cheek homage to gritty retro slashers and sleazy 70's porno. In my opinion, there's nothing to really analyze seriously here. That wasn't the intent. The actors did a good job and the gore was well made, but as said, i felt like the ideas fizzled in the second half of the movie. Not bad, but a loss of momentum.I would still recommend people to see it, cause i can understand that this could be a favorite for many.",2022-04-15
"The movie was honestly excellent I loved the progression of the characters the idea of the story the creepiness of the villains everything was pretty solid I have to say, and this is coming from a guy who thought the last couple A24 films were kind of crappy.I had to jump in here because some of these reviews saying it was ""over the top gross"" or ""extremely disturbing"" are just plain ridiculous.This movie is TAME compared to a lot things out there, WHAT DID YOU THINK YOU WERE WALKING INTO???It was creepy, funny, violent, entertaining and disturbing.Solid slow burn horrorIf you thought it was bad then you just have no idea what the hell you are talking about.You want to talk disturbing today watch ""Martyrs"" or ""Inside"" you cowards.If you think I am talking about you then yes, I am.",2022-03-19
"7.8
A standout horror story dialing up the retro vibe, delivering up some top-notch gore and scares in a salacious art porn fused romp.Adding to being set in the 70s, the film's production style mirrors 70s porn films and is a clear nod to horror genre films of the time. This works really well for the film. It enhances the creepiness and craziness of the situation, steadily building the fear and tension to the climax.At first glance, the characters fit the stereotypical necessities for a horror film, but the writing and performances take them up a level and bring them to life enough for the suspense to get under your skin.The dialogue is also better than it has any business being for this type of film. There is a lot of depth in the story and motivation that everyone will be faced with at some point in life.The costume design is great. There aren't many clothes on anyone. Fantastic!The cinematography is exquisitely executed.Doorways, Windows, and darkness are the stars here. You never know what's around the corner. Director Ti West manages to always draw you forward, daring you to engage deeper with the film. The score and music selection bring the period to life and perfectly accentuates the terror.It can get like it's starting off slow, but this makes the kills even more powerful and the payoff all the more satisfying.Another success from A24. Unfortunately for A24 they didn't get 1 single jump outta me but made me laugh and smile all the way through. Must for horror fans. Although it's not an over-the-top gorefest, it's not for the squeamish.Delightful!",2023-10-09
"X is a very unsettling movie to say the least. I watch movies knowing very little about them besides the general genre(s) and perhaps the names of a few actors in them.It's definitely not a movie I'd care to watch again anytime soon because it's somewhat depressing, but at the same time it was fairly well put together, consistent and tosses a few hard to swallow scenes at you. It has off-putting and cringe inducing elements which is where the one time viewing mostly comes from, but on the other hand I'd still consider it a better movie than some I may sooner rewatch even though I'd consider them to be a 5 or 6.The later portion played out in a mostly predictable fashion however there were a few unexpected (and sometimes hilarious) surprises.",2022-12-08
There is nothing new in this movie except the Horney half dead old lady. Some people rate it 10. Really does is worth 10 star. I think the Horney half dead old lady make this movie more comedy than horror.,2022-04-15
"Its more porn than horror. Just wasted my time on this. I like how she pushed the girl in the lake but , when she shot the shotgun she flyied away.And the fact that the old guys had sex and after 2 minutes they were dressed up at the door of the other house ready to shoot the girl.I dont know how can you like this movie if you are searching for a horror movie , maybe if you are a ""labagiu"" and only likes the characters .The jumpscares are dull and there is a musical in between the first and the second act wich completly ruins the expectation.Personally i like horror movies and this disappointed my expectation.",2023-04-23
Love this one 👌 super stylish and the soundtrack is also amazing. Loveeeeeee. Ti west did an amazing job the tone of the movie is pretty unique and very refreshing.,2022-04-02
"Slow to get going but once starts it's bloody.Some great fx.What was the most surprising about this film was that all of the characters are likeable. Which is a shock. Each character has their own personality and are genuinely good people, no stereotypes like in all other horrors. (The bimbo, the jock, the comedic one, the innocent one.) So extra point for that because in this film none of them deserve what eventually happens to them. (Nastily)Plot sets up the film crew setting out to a farm to make a porn film.The sex scenes are tame of course but the volume of the women prolonged moaning may convince your neighbours you are watching something other than a horror film. Ha ha.The reasons behind the killings are somewhat vague but believably executed considering who the protagonist is.I'd have liked them to have all looked a little more 70s fashion wise as except for the affro it could have been anytime.Nice gore. Not quite as much as I was hoping but when it was done it was done well.",2022-05-21
"If you wanna see a topless granny go nuts on everyone then this is for you. What I likes about this is the fact that its not spontaneous and its somewhat a slow burner and also very predictable. But, just like in any horror slasher movie the cast plays very dumb in predictable situations.",2022-06-11
"My inner Tarantino liked it . It reminded me of 2008 or 09s Death proof . Judging by A24 s orthodox way of making a cinema , this one stands out as pretty unique. I wrote it because every a24 movie shows tragedy , unnecessary slow pace & nobody makes it out alive.This one didn't.I get it that all the characters in the movie made stupid choices which led them to their ending but it also showed the root of evil , the old psychotic couple were given something of a reason. You don't always need satanic activity to tap that inner devil . Repressed emotions. That made the granny crazy instantaneously
; Made the protagonist girl leave her fanatic of a father , saved her again from two old hags . The twist saved the movie , i was thinking of something but the twist subverted my expectations & Then again in a good way . Great job . Great job Ti west . In religious countries this movie could be sued .Logic & repressed emotions , what a powerful combination it is !",2022-04-28
"I don't understand how this has such great reviews on here and from critics. This is one of the most vile, disgusting, and just messed up movies I've ever seen. In many ways, those words would be a compliment for a horror movie I want to look for, but in this case, it is absolutely not. I cannot explain just how bad this is.It started off fine at the beginning and I was actually excited for what felt like a great slasher from the 70's. It was beginning to feel like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but it delved into something way weirder and worse.The acting is laughable. The underlying ""plot"" (if you'd call it that), is cringy, and the ending is just stupid. The old folks were just nasty and I felt like I needed to bathe after watching this. And it wasn't for the gore, tbh, there wasn't a ton of gore outside of one of the first scenes in the movie. The gore would've been welcome over whatever this was... Just a disgrace to the audience.",2022-06-27
"This is one of the best horror films in years and this film will no doubt become a classic horror. The story, editing and eerie location returns the viewer to classic horror films like Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The acting is good, much better then your average attempt at horror films. This film is so good, I watched it two nights in a row. It has your typical T&A, gore and scares but the witty writing and haunting location make this one of the best horror films in many years. Ti West is my new favourite horror writer, director and producer. I'll be watching Ti's future film contributions very closely. Well done and deserving of 10 stars.",2022-04-15

"I really was expecting a lot more, maybe I got some other previews mixed up with it. Anyways, it produced as a '70's sjlasher film, the type we used to see at drive-ins - lordy I miss those. This would have been perfect for a drive in movie, maybe we'll see it in one this summer.Anyways, there isn't really much to it, aside from some obviously studio produced gore and some mild nudity and drug use. I'm really not sure why they had the drug use because it didn't have a point'The premise is the group is going out to a country house to make an X rated movie, but the older couple who own the guest house have other ideas. I'd say, 7 out of 10 people could write the rest of the script from what little information I've given you so far.It's an ok film if you're bored, or, like I said, at a drive in.",2023-04-17
I found the movie to be entertaining unlike most slasher films the characters are fun to watch especially Mia goth as Maxine and Jenna Ortega as Lorrenane the movie takes a little while to get into the horror stuff but when it does has awesome pay off with suspense build up and good gruesome kills i though Mia goth was awesome as Maxine who was a good character but she also plays the old lady killer Pearl I do root for the main character but the movie could drag a bit at times during the first half and there was a scene that was gross I wish there was more of Jenna Ortega character overall I really enjoyed the film 3rd best of the year so far.,2022-03-20
"This movie was quite disappointing not much happened, wasn't really that scary, over all just a quite boring movie had to skip most of it boring conversation in it that has nothing to do with the movie everyone dies but the main character which is literally half of scary movies the ending was like a small twist but that's it I would of loved if there was a twist in it that could be that everyone died to an alien but nah didn't happen which is absolutely unacceptable if there was an alien in this movie i bet so many people would have loved it was more or like an unicorn that would be a great thriller if like a unicorn became evil and started killing everybody innit.",2022-09-26
"X successfully captures the unsettling griminess of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, its most overt stylistic influence and antecedent. The two movies are similar in their aesthetic and adherence to basic slasher tropes. But the similarities end there, for better and worse. The worse is that X meanders through an overlong buildup that takes the majority of its runtime. It's basically a boring behind-the-scenes look at making an adult film. We spend an inordinate amount of time getting to know the small cast and crew, but since none of them are particularly interesting or likeable it's a waste of time. I'm sure the filmmakers thought they had something profound to say about the similarities between mainstream exploitative Hollywood violence and disreputable adult movie exploitation. But it's all so drawn out it becomes repetitive and annoying. There are also a couple subplots that go absolutely nowhere. The better, depending on your personal tastes, is that once it does become a slasher in the third act it's hilariously over-the-top and bloody, with a good deal more humor and gore than TCM managed.",2023-02-01
"I saw tons of horror creators on TikTok raving about this movie, and figured it wouldn't hurt to give it a chance. It's boring af. Nothing happens for the first hour of the movie. Then what happens next is super predictable and still uninteresting. This movie took itself way to seriously for what it was. If this was meant to be a horror comedy than I guess that succeeded, because I was laughing at every serious scene. Really hoped Maxine would get offed because she was so annoying. Don't waste your time, it was an hour of bad sex scenes and then an hour of religious old people committing murders.",2022-10-30
"Probably one of the worst ""horror"" movies I have ever seen. I was expecting so much from this film after everyone raved about it, but apparently no one can make a good horror film these days. I gave it 3 stars only for the eerie/ creepy music. First part of the movie is super boring second half you figure out is super predictable.",2022-04-25
I love Ti West and was so excited for this movie. I am pleased to say that it did not disappoint! West deserves so much credit for making a movie that feels entirely fresh while still paying homage to classic horror movies like Psycho and The Shining. X is just sort of genius in every regard.,2022-03-19
X is easily the best horror movie in recent times with equal doses of Adult Fun and Gore.Elderly characters have really acted well which looked realistic. I also liked the background music and songs throughout the movie.Overall a Fun Watch!!,2022-04-23
"XWritten, directed, produced and edited by Ti West, X sees a pornographic film's cast and crew journey to a town in Texas to shoot. Their production is jeopardized when the elderly couple they're renting from begin a murder spree.Themes of hagsploitation, aging and youth, and voyeurism are explored in this flick. X is also an homage to former slasher movies, especially The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.The cast of X is brilliant. Much praise goes to Mia Goth for her double portrayal of Maxine (Young lead) and Pearl (old antagonist). Jenna Ortega, Scott Mescudi and Brittany Snow also gave good performances.The pacing of X was laborious, and even with the dreadful aura in the first half, the slow easing into the horrific second part took too long. The horrific second half could have also had more creativity. But even with all its flaws, Ti West's editing and the camera work wrap everything up well.With X being the first movie in its X trilogy, the remaining movies should build on X.6.5/10.",2023-09-16
"It was almost as if this ""horror film"" was actually a satirical comedy of a horror film. I really couldn't tell. Half-ass acting, same generalized slasher plot of anticipated timing and cheap kills. Classic dumb introduction opening with the final crime scene to be to really start the viewer off guessing ""HOW, WHAT, NO WAY..""Followed by a slow burning ""24 hrs earlier"" build up of irrelevant nonsense within a plot focused on shooting a porno which stood only to elongate the viewer's attention until deaths start occurring. No thrilling nor surprising content on any front, never had me guessing. The small points of comic relief were probably the most entertaining aspect. Disappointed overall. Nonsensical gore. Dullest plot to win them all. I should've went to see Spider-Man.",2022-04-04

"I usually click on anything from A24 they usually bring new, interesting content to the screen, but this one is the weakest one yet. It's a slasher movie, but its not scary at all. The gore is laughable and the other part are just vulgar and gross. The only saving grace for this creation might be the good talent that Mia Goth, Brittany Snow and Kid Kudi, but there is nothing saving this weak, predictable and non-inspired screenplay; Even the decent filmography doesn't do it.I'll touch on another point that I don't see widely discussed- Mia Goth is in a double role in this movie. I feel that while this choice is interesting, it is completely unnecessary, doesn't help the story at all and (I assume) make the production a lot harder. So, the only reason to do it is to glorify the acting abilities of Mia? Was that was 'sold' her on the movie? In any event it ended up ruining it IMO.I urge you to spare $5 and 1.5 hrs of you life by not watching this scuz! Exact score: 51 / 100.",2022-06-20
"This is one of those movies that I wish hadn't read the reviews prior. Going in, critics raved about this movie calling it a masterpiece. When in reality, X tries to be both a gory horror movie and a social commentary on things like youth, beauty, growing older and death. In my opinion it spreads itself too thin and accomplishes neither. This may be a good watch for someone just getting into the horror genre, but personally it left me wanting more.",2022-06-06
"X is a movie about characters attempting to make ""elevated porn."" It's a commentary on itself, insisting that IT is elevated horror. But there's just no substance.

"There are already many well thought out reviews here, and I argee with most of them which say it's a competent film, well told, well acted, but nothing which would make it stand out in a crowded field (other than many are not well written/acted).But, being somewhat older and familiar professionally with strip clubs, and some porn productions, in Texas in the late '70s, early '80s, Wayne simply would not have cast a black male lead. Even today, interracial is considered a niche porn, and in the '70s Texas, strip clubs were almost universally segregated. The two dancers would have been committing professional suicide if word got out (and it's a movie, so it would get out), and Wayne would have lost tons of business. Wayne references Debbie Does Dallas. You've never seen a whiter cast in your life.So why not use it in the movie? Local rednecks could have tried to crash the show because of it (upping the body count), but a more realistic way would have been to have the camera man be black, and frustrated when his girlfriend decided to be in the movie, Wayne could remind him that he couldn't be in it because of his race. Just like RJ, this could frustrate him into leaving. Thus, we get both a realistic representation of race relations back then, and the same result.We also can't overlook the fact that it's still difficult to get a black woman in many roles where they are an object of beauty. Here, in a 2021 production, no black women were cast out of 3 roles.From a technical perspective, the filming inside, late at night, would have been impossible with the equipment at the time, without a LOT of extra lights. And the cameras didn't record sound themselves, and your sound engineer was, well, preoccupied.",2023-03-31

"First of all, an overly used cliche Texas Chainsaw teen slasher set up is boldly wasted in the first hour of the film for creating dramatic atmosphere mainly fed by backwoods alienation of hillbilly antagonists.Secondly, camera set ups and execution of scenes are way too much Tarantino inspired that you almost feel like you are watching a copycat with way worse writing and dialogues.Is it that bad? No... acting, sound, editing and cinematography are actually pretty decent. That's why it's 2/10.In conclusion, It is like Hills Have Eyes that wants to be To Kill a Mockingbird.",2022-04-29

X is a throwback film. A tribute to the horror movies of the 1970s. But it manages to do that with a sophistication that defies the very films it is paying tribute to. It is a film that lets it's mood do it's work for it. You're drawn in almost instantly but it never stoops to just being a gore film. It is tense and frightening. It's well acted and masterfully directed. You just don't expect X to be as good as it is. That's not to say there isn't gore. There is. Though not as much as you'd expect. This above all is a well made suspense horror. Fans of the genre will watch it and like it because it delivers. But you do not need to be a fan of the genre to really like this film. X is one of those films that defies its genre. And that's what really good films are supposed to do. Now I just have to watch all of Ti West's other films.,2022-10-09

"As a fan of 70s and 80s slashers, this has to be one of the most boring movies I've seen recently.The good: I enjoyed the overall theme of the movie, and the last 10 minutes or so were pretty intense and morbidly hilarious.The bad: so, so incredibly boring. All characters are completely static and one-dimensional, and there is nothing interesting about any of them. Every single conversation they have is, ""we're gonna make the best porno movie ever!"" *cut to cheesy ass on-the-nose Fleetwood Mac cover* ""we're gonna make the best porno movie ever!"" As soon as there's some interesting development between two characters in the film, one of them is killed so that development goes nowhere. I don't expect intricate character writing from a slasher, but if you're gonna make a movie where NOTHING happens until the last 10 minutes, at least bring something to the characters to create tension and interest. I honestly cannot understand how anyone liked this one.",2022-09-02

"X is an interesting horror movie. On one hand, you get a lot of the classic feel of horror films, especially from the 70s. The look and feel of the movie is a fairly obvious (imo) homage to 70s horror films like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and the Hills Have Eyes. There's sex, obviously, seeing as the plot follows the crew of an adult movie.The gore is realistic if a little over the top and the physical effects work well. There's some good kill scenes and they're mostly unexpected.The movie is definitely horrifying and has some moments that are hard to watch in a good way.What the movie does best, however, is its characters. The characters are pretty interesting and each of them has a good amount of depth for a horror film. The main character, Maxine, has a lot of interesting depth in particular.That said, I think this movie has a major flaw for a horror movie and the major flaw is very simple. There's next to no tension in this movie. The very best horror films aren't just gory or filled with brutal deaths. They contain suspense and anticipation. The scariest moments for me are never when someone gets brutally killed with gore flying all over the place. It's the charged moments between or before killings where your imagination runs wild out of fear. While X is certainly disgusting and horrifying in terms of gore and death, I'm not sure it's ever actually scary.Overall, X has some really nice characters and interesting themes but falls short as a horror movie due to the lack of tension and suspense.",2022-11-02
"X is a horror film directed by Ti West that follows a group of young filmmakers who try to make an adult film in rural Texas but end up being hunted by a twisted elderly couple. The film pays tribute to the classic slasher films of the 1970s, such as The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, with its gritty and grainy aesthetic, its shocking and gory violence, and its dark humor. The film also subverts some of the genre conventions by exploring themes of voyeurism, sexuality, and aging. The film features a dual performance by Mia Goth as both the lead actress and the killer old lady under heavy makeup. It is also part of a larger story that will continue with a prequel titled Pearl, which will focus on the origin of the old lady.I enjoyed X for its clever and creative homage to 70s horror, its engaging and quirky characters, its disturbing and bloody kills, and its unexpected twists. I think Ti West did a great job of balancing horror and comedy, while also adding some depth and commentary to his story. I would recommend X to fans of horror who appreciate a good throwback with a modern twist.",2023-03-04
"I love the first half of the premise, of a 70s adult movie crew that finds itself stalked by a menace.The execution is just not very good. Really, nothing works quite as it should. The porn angle isn't executed that well and that side of the story just drags along. The slasher part isn't interesting either once it becomes clear who the killers are.

"Not quite as great as The House Of The Devil from Mr. West but this is would be my second favorite of his. This is more of a Texas Chainsaw Massacre type of horror movie but West ends up doing it wonderfully.Wonderfully shot with beautiful camera work and cinematography, good atmosphere, good acting and good horror elements. Also the audio/sound is well done. If you want a good old school style horror movie and enjoyed The House Of The Devil I suggest picking this up, its West's 2nd best movie imo!",2022-05-26
"Like the premise, had potential but average at best. The acting is great but the story and pace just don't work. TI West's You're Next is way more fun and House of the Devil is so much creepier and eerie and just a better overall horror movie.",2022-04-17
"Watched this with zero context. Didn't even know if it was a horror, comedy whatever.I love horror films and this one was pretty good actually. Felt a bit rushed at the end and just took a little bit too long to get to the point which then made it feel kinda rushed. Otherwise the acting and filming was good. Cinematography was good too. Made it feel very 70's look while maintaining a modern HD look at the same time.",2022-05-24
"I went in with mediocre expectations but was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed the story and it started off strong but at times felt a little off kilter, which is fine it's a horror movie. Gotta go in expecting some of that from time to time. Characters I felt were well done and definitely out of the norm as far as what you would expect. And I appreciated that, it didn't follow the ""good girl lives"" formula. The only gripes that I have is that at times it was a little too predictable. Again yes it's a horror so it's to be expected. But who has 3 perfect holes through a barn door that happen to line up with a pitch fork lol. All in all, good flick. Will definitely watch the prequal.",2022-12-13
"Other than the setup, this one is as generic of a slasher you can get.Rather than ""Teens going to camp/roadtrip/somewhere desolate"" this one is based on a crew getting together to film a porno at the advent of the low cost video camera. They rent a property but the property owners happen to be the highest energy elderly people on the planet, as well as murderers.Like you would expect from a generic slasher, none of the characters are really fleshed out. Some of the special effects are good. Some of the odder things in the movie being Mia Goth's uncanny valley old person makeup as well as a few scenes of goofy schlock near the end of the movie that were completely out of place.There isn't a single stand out thing about the movie but it's isn't bad, just bare minimum competent. Have you seen all the other slashers and want one that doesn't stink, give X a go.",2023-01-06
"I really wanted to like it. It started somehow interesting but I was actually bored like 90% of the time. Nice tribute to 70s films. The cinematography was cool regarding that, because at times it really felt like a 70s film.But as soon at the creepy parts unfold it was super predictable. I was like okay, it's the horny granny killing everyone. And then really like one by one in the most stupid ways.After RJ died I was already only waiting for it to be over. No more twist, no more surprise.Honestly, I'd rather watch 3 times the house of wax remake. Seriously. I have more fun watching that. Yes, the one with Paris Hilton in it.The crocodile was cool and since we met him when the lead was swimming, I knew it'll come back killing someone.I was disappointed. Had higher expectations.",2022-06-28
"This film was a tribute to 70's slashers, nearly recreating the genre but with a few thoughtful twists with the story/themes. It looks like a 70s slasher, feels like one, sounds like one, etc. When I was watching it, I really felt like I was watching another one of those films. So if you like those movies, you will love it. If you don't, and I don't, then you will probably agree that the small tweaks they did to the conventions of the genre didn't somehow turn it into a work of art on par with other A24 movies. It's for a specific kind of fan and I'm sure they really liked it.",2022-04-19
"Ti West has made quite the name for himself styling his films like the kinds of movies that don't get made anymore and this one is no different. It follows an adult film crew who rent a cabin next to the home of a strange husband and wife who don't take kindly to their presence on their property. Soon, they're being sliced, diced, and hacked into little pieces. The film takes time to get to know its victims which helps a lot and there's some good suspense and pleasant surprises.",2022-04-24

created mood and environment of fear almost gets you completely - it's really an echo of 70ties and 80ties - eerie.Beautifully written, no jump scares, only pure flesh and sex, tears and blood, visceral yet fulfilling.As one horror should be.X is a spark of creativity and originality among all others recycled horrors.Main actress Mia Goth is primarly to thank for that. She brings joy among us vintage horror lovers.Ever since her movie A cure for wellness, Mia has shown and proven time and time again to be a master in her vocation and dedicated to the genre and art.Her passion and artistic expression is bound to the genre, and her emotions permeate through all of us.Thank you for this movie it's really a masterclass!!

"A bit more trashy than I'd hoped for. The old man's makeup is absolutely stellar. Floating in fresh water is very difficult and man that's a big gator!Some didn't appreciate the 70's, but who doesn't love a leisure suit or a tube top. They did a nice job of capturing the lack of the consequences of the pop culture of the time. A special well done to Brittany Snow's rendition of Fleetwood Mac's ""Landslide."" But, ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" is about suicide not murder; a great tune!There's no wisdom in searching for someone in your underwear and barefoot, you might step in moocow poo, and there's ticks out there man!People that drink out of the carton are doomed and I think they're feeding that gator.",2022-07-16

"The trailers I had seen for this made it look cool. Possibly a fresh take on a tired genre (horror)... I wasn't sure if it would be a bit more satirical (like Cabin In The Woods) or if it would take itself seriously and be inventive (like Don't Breathe)... it was neither.What's good: the cinematography and editing are mostly very good. It's visually very pleasing, and has some stylization where the audience is seeing through their old 16mm film camera. The acting is mostly good, though I wasn't super familiar with any of the stars; though I did enjoy Mia Goth in High Life. A couple of the gore scenes are pretty unique and cool. The soundtrack is pretty decent, fair amount of hits from that era, and some cliché needle drops like ""don't fear the reaper"".What's bad:
The writing is very weak. Now the actual dialogue holds up for the most part, but the story itself is basic. There's no twist, no super natural force, no big surprise or real meaning to it all. It felt under developed, and I actually would have welcomed some unrealistic motivation for the events that take place. The characters do have SOME development, but are still fairly 2 dimensional. And then everything just sort of happens. There are one or two instances where they set things up, but never give us any payoff for the setup... looming threats that you're sure will come into play, but nope.I say 5/10 because it is worth a watch if you're curious... but it's the definition of wasted potential. It had far too much going for it to be as mediocre as it is.",2022-05-07
"I was so hyped for this movie, so I had to go see it, and while I think my expectations were too high but I still very much enjoyed it. Britney acted very well, Kid Cudi is likeable, Jenna Ortega felt like a cameo to me, being barely in it. Without spoiling anything most people may not like the gross and weirdness of the film.",2022-03-31
The movie is so dark you may as well watch it with your eyes closed. Other reviewers said that it was gory but I certainly could not say the same. Was hoping it would be better.,2022-07-14
"This is a pretty good movie!! I think there are a few things that hold this movie back from meeting its full potential but first I want to discuss what I found very good about the film.Based on the premice and my knowledge of slasher tropes I was really worried that this would in some way condemn the main characters for making porn or make it seem like some sort of moral failing so the villian felt justified. This is thankfully not the case! This movie has a more realistic view on sex work and sexuality in general that is refreshing in a genre that so many times falls into some variation of sexism and purity culture. The porn stars in this movie are not treated like degenerates, and they arent treated like martyrs who fell victim to the sex industry. They are people with their own autonomy who have their own reasons for doing the work that they do.Another thing I liked is similar to the first, but it was interesting to see the unique way sexuality is shown in the film. As opposed to being written to be a shallow, shameful act, it is written as an integral part of a person's self worth. It isn't supposed to be overly profound or pretentious, but it is somethin that the characters feel strongly about without that aspect of themselves being shamed.Other things that were done well were the attention to cinematography and the subtle foreshadowing in the first act of the movie. I feel as though the tension was built sufficiently and there are some genuinely scary moments beyond the expected jumpscares.Aside from that, I would say that this is a pretty standard slasher. It delves into its themes in a thoughtful and unique way, but it still follows the formula you would expect. Likeable characters and a simple story. It had a scene or two of dead space filled with dreamy music which is par for the course with A24 films. I am personally not a fan of this, but I do not think that it is of much detriment to the film.If you are comfortable with violence and sexual content, give it a watch! It is a good film.",2022-11-10
"On the surface this film is a wonderful love letter to those grainy, gritty horror classics from the 70's such as Tobe Hopper's ""the Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (1974) and ""Eaten Alive"" (1976). The photography, from that opening 4:3 ratio shot onwards, editing and mise en scene all conjure up memories of Hooper's great early films. However, this is not some self-conscious, Tarantinoesque Grindhouse movie, because all of these elements serve perfectly to conjure up the atmosphere of a lonely, hot farmhouse in 1970's Texas and also add to the growing sense of tension and unease. Yes, you certainly can play Post-modernist ""Spot the film reference bingo"" but you feel that Ti West respects the horror film genre and that he uses these references as an acknowledgement not an attempt to look cool.The pacing and forward momentum is excellent, allowing us to get to know the characters and therefore care about them. The script/dialogue is convincing and the sense of being drawn into a nightmare wholly palpable.The cast are uniformly excellent. Mia Goth is a genuine screen presence, ethereal, lost and damaged, despite her optimism about her impending stardom. Brittany Snow is an absolute revelation. I remember her fondly in ""Hairspray"" (2007) as Amber Von Trussle but since then she has been a fairly anonymous presence in some very bland movies such as ""Prom Night"" (2008). Here she is the ""good time girl"" who knows the score, who knows where her talents lie and is long past the stage where she engages in the kind of daydreams that motivate Mia Goth's character. If we still made film noir films she would be a great lead in those type of movies, bringing a sense of pragmatism and wordly-wisdom to her character.There is a clear subtext, also reflected in one of the major casting choices, about the loss of youth, desire and ambition. Continuing with a theme contained in the 2022 Netfix ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" this film pits the elderly against the young. I'm not sure why this is emerging as a theme in horror at the moment? After all you'd think with the older generation ruining the economy, house prices, the environment etc for the younger generation the ""revenge"" would be the other way around!? Meanwhile the televangelist plays out in the background in the grimmest scenes.The film also plays with the theme of sex and violence and I think, as evidenced by the Sheriff's final comments at the end of the film, engages in the debate around why in the USA people are willing to accept violence in their daily visual entertainment media but are disturbed by sex and nudity. The economics of low budget movie making and the commercial opportunities presented by early video are also explored. RJ, the director, wants to make art, Wayne, the producer, wants to make money.The violence in this film is grim, the sex pretty uninhibited and that is what the directors had to include in their movies back in the 70's to compete with mainstream movies with big stars, big budgets and coast to coast promotion! Unfortunately, that ""edge"" has gone from the hundreds of awful modern low budget ""horror"" films that exist now on platforms such as Amazon, as they serve up a series of films that barely exist because they are so devoid of content or ability. ""X"" on the other hand works on every level and will hopefully serve as an inspiration to new filmmakers as opposed to the dreadful ""found footage"", ""haunted house"" etc template that most of them currently operate within.In a horror film world of tedious production line remakes and pointless low budget movies ""X"" is the best horror film I've seen over the last 3 or 4 years as it engages with your heart, naughty bits, and brain, as all truly great horror films should!I understand that West has already undertaken a lot of work on a prequel and that a sequel may be planned as well. I'm certainly looking forward to those with anticipation but ""Ti, don't mess it up"".",2022-03-24
"To see if you can watch the whole thing without covering your eyes. The ""aha"" moment wasn't a meaningful reveal. Old people being horny is a weird plot.",2022-05-27
"'X' couldn't have a more promising plot or a better start. Not only is the perfect example of the 70's and 80's explotation cinema, it's basically 'The Texas chainsaw massacre' had it have better budget and 2020's resources and technology. The ambientation is absolutely on point, and the cinematography -aside from some questionable editing choices and a few weird, overly experimetnal camera angles- is gorgeous. On the paper it's a B movie no matter how you look at it, but on the screen it doesn't look the part. The first half of the movie burns slowlier than damp wood and even so I couldn't have enjoyed it any better.But by the time the production of the X movie of the movie 'X' (kind of like a dream inside a dream) starts picking pace you can sense the accident coming. You're on the deck of the Titanic watching the iceberg grow closer and you know the collision is inevitable. The cinematography is still majestic, the visual appeal is still there and the actors do a great job even with the weakest scenes -except for Brittany which is annoyingly overacting even for someone who has clearly been asked to do so- but the film lingers too much on the gratuitous sex scenes even for an explotation movie and a bit of character developement which would have been welcomed had it paid of at any point, but the ship hits the iceberg before it can.Once the killings start it's all downhill. The movie turns into a weird horror comedy filled with goofy and incredibly foreseeable deaths -the alligator one can be called the moment the animal makes his appearance- and all the runtime spent developing the characters goes down the drain as they turn into brainless meatbags with the sole purpose of dying. Even the directing and camera work take two steps backwards, and while there are still some stunning shots -the old lady with the pitchfork on the barn and her devil-like shadow getting bigger is astounding-, the movie finally looks like every other 'Texas chainsaw massacre' rip-off, plain and uninspired. Little matters that the murders make as little sense as the perpetrators, because at that point 'X' has lost its one distinguising trait and joined the rank of mediocre horror films with great but wasted potential.",2022-06-30
"Imagine Tobe Hooper had a bigger budget and better actors to direct for Texas Chainsaw Massacre.....
X is a silly movie with a silly plot that succeeds despite its parameters.Five ambitious adult fiim makers travel to a rental property in Texas to make a direct to video x-rated movie for the burgeoning home video business of the late 70s and 80s.They ultimately run into a decades long murderous plot by the husband and wife who own the property.The acting is superb as well as creating a genuinely touching story of the elderly couple who run the rental property.I would give an 8 out of 10 if I felt compelled to watch it again, but I don't. That being said, it was good entertainment.",2022-09-29
"I loved this movie. I watched it with three others; one didn't care for it, one was disgusted, and the other one didn't get it. This is certainly not for everyone, but in this day and age where good horror films are hard to find, this one is a must watch for horror fans.It is admittedly slow, but that doesn't mean it is boring. There's a certain charm throughout the film that captivates and entices you for what's to come.The first half builds the characters and the tension. The second half gives us the gore and horror.I'm not usually fond of jumpscares, they're often cheap and lazy. But there was one in this film that genuinely got me, even making me gasp.Overall, I highly recommend this movie. It has a refreshing soundtrack, great tension, interesting kills, and enough to think about.Also, the use of Don't Fear The Reaper in this film was absolutely awesome.",2022-03-27
"Movies starts off pretty good, exactly what you expect from a teen slasher. That old lady looked creepy enough in the beginning. However, after a few scenes you notice that there is something weird about how she moves and how her face looks. It was obvious that it was an act. I immediately realized that she's a young person actually and it ruined everything for me. It was so annoying, I had to pause the movie and check the actor who played her. Mia Goth played two chracters in the movie. What was the point? Because of budget? Or she thought that she could pull it off? Even director might have thought that she's great for the role. In the end all that creepiness were gone and I felt that I'm watching a trashy spoof film.Premise is good really. Hating your life because of the past opportunites you've missed along with your youth. Also actor choices are fine but why would you choose someone young for this role? If it's necessary they could have used a double for certain scenes instead. Additionally, things start to get out of hand after a certain moment and movie becomes a pointless gore fest. Once she killed the director, she started to kill everyone without any obvious reason. Movie even didn't bother to build up more suspense. I'm sure it would get attention in certain horror film festivals but in the end it falls short.",2022-05-01

"I love the commentary on generational trauma and how every generation that has a gap with its next one won't shut up about how they know how life will turn out and can't help but resent the youth because of having the fun they couldn't have when they were young.That's not even the case sometimes, sometimes they just hate the youth because they're having fun that they can't have because they're just too old.I thought the ending was cleverly anticlimactic, both the old man's heart problems and the old woman's hip were previously established and at the end it was their own age and fragility that was their downfall, truly a satisfying and deserving death.I watched this during the 2022 protests in Iran and given how the previous Iranian generation revolted against its government and how this generation is doing the same I hear a lot of people saying that they know how this story will end and say we shouldn't do it and make no mistake, I agree with them but still, it hit pretty close to home with me.The twist at the end was also pretty clever and well set up, how the girl was that Christian speaker's daughter. They really took Chekhov's gun and jacked it up to eleven!All in all, probably my favorite slasher movie ever, though I probably have seen maybe 4 or 5 of them in total.",2022-11-06
"8/10Repression, regret, and envy.These are the core themes of X.Cattle live boring uneventful lives until one day they're gone. There's a reason Wayne and his makeshift family drive around them. They are not cattle. They are the counterculture. Sure they have their flaws but deep down all of them are friendly, kind, and passionate.Is it any coincidence the house they're renting is full of warmth and light? Compared to the older couple who represent a repressed, regretful, and ultimately jealous society who only manage to find their jollies and bond by stifling, by ""snuffing out,"" the people who relate to their archaic values. It's a culture war to them and they're trying to preserve society.Only then does light, warmth, and passion emerge in their home.My one issue with this movie is that it's anvilicious when it doesn't need to be. Bobby Lynne, Wayne, Jackson, and the older couple TELL us through dialogue the themes of the film which I stated above.Completely unnecessary when it does a decent job of conveying it via visual storytelling.It ends on a positive note. The counterculture strikes back. The boomers lose, the young people and their progressive values endure after a harrowing battle.We millennials and Gen Z'ers desperately needed this movie in these trying times.Nice homages to Psycho and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, too.",2022-03-21

I love it!It's also so much more than that.X showcases ideas about youth, beauty, aging and intimacy in stark detail: at times gruesome, of course, but more surprisingly, heartbreakingly. I was surprised at how moved I was by this film.It succeeds as a horror film all on it's own, but if you care to look deeper, it is filled to the brim with things that will effect us all, that many of us fear: things like aging, our ability to care for the ones we love and be intimate with them in the ways both parties desire.There is more than one type of horror in this film.",2022-07-01

It's tough to review something this bad without spoilers. The characters were stupid and had no common sense, the protagonist was unbelievable, the little tension that was actually created quickly died. Classic horror letdown - making up for a weak storyline with blood and gore. Congratulations to Kid Cudi on his first (presumably) porno film. Man on the Moon: Blood in the Bayou.

"Ti West made a big splash when he landed on the indie horror scene and has brought us several terror tales of varying subject matter, subgenre, and quality, but can't say he's not interesting and open to trying new things.X is West's attempt at making a classic 70's style slasher film along the lines of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but he puts his own unique stamp on the proceedings with his trademark attention to characters and mood. The pace might be a little lethargic for some, but it delivers with it's bloody last act.Gore fans will rejoice when the film's lead villain starts going on a rampage and taking down the participants of a low budget porno shoot.

X leaves you with that uneasy feeling that weights on you that horror fans look for and it doesn't let up until the credits roll. The cinematography and editing in X are over the top and forces you to believe this movie took place in the 70's and that over the top look is what makes me love this movie more and more with every scene.

"I think this is one of the better slashers of recent days. You could almost say the genre is dead, but this movie holds up quite well. Has excellent pacing, a couple of tense scenes, great lighting and a tasteful amount of blood on screen. Although it could have had another layer of 'scare', the movie didn't come across as trying too hard, which is sometimes better than taking those overdone risks.

"While there are lots of reviews telling ""'tHiS wAs A bAd mOvIe"" without pointing up why, I'll say this is an awesome movie, would rate it 8/10, but did put 10 so the rate increases, and people can actually give it a shot.It has everything a horror movie needs: tension, plot and blood (lots of it). On a technical level, it's something you wouldn't expect of horror movies from this day, just good as the acting and everything else on this movie.Although sometimes it may fall into some horror movies cliche, it doesn't happen often, and doesn't disturbed the experience in my point of view. The characters are well wrighten and villain's motivations aren't the ""he killed because he's a psycho"", like the majority of slasher movies to this day.The movie is good, and can even scare some of those who don't get easily scared, just give it a try ;).",2022-05-01
"The cinematic experience of the movie is actually pretty good. I like the concept of a 70s slasher film. That's the only good thing I will say about it. Classic horror movies are my favorite! However, the fact that these actresses would demoralize their bodies and themselves basically having sex on film is so disgusting. I honestly looked up to Brittany Snow for a long time but after watching this movie, I am so ashamed and disappointed in her choice to go this far. I bought her book, September Letters that centers around mental health, but I will be burning this book after watching her exploit herself. She completely lost my respect. The ONLY good thing about this movie is when the gator eats her alive to be honest.",2023-09-17
"Make no mistake, this is a well made movie.Important stuff: the acting is spot on, the directing is good and the general filmography is artsy.So why only 6 stars you may ask. Well .. for a start pacing is slightly off. It is a slow start and a lengthy build-up to the crescendo. The make up is not convincing and makes some scenes feel cheap. The biggest downfall however is that the story is simply a rehash of slashers like Wrong Turn and The Hills have Eyes. Once the plot twist untangles you will no doubt remind yourself that you have seen this story before.Good to burn 90 minutes - bad for the art of horror ....... (I would like to inform Hollywood that this is not a horror - it is a slasher. There is a big difference.)",2022-04-14
This movie was wired and strange overall but in my opinion that's what's made it more enjoyable. I only watched it because of Jenna Ortega but I think it's worth a watch it's full of unexpected scenes and very entertaining especially for people who are into the wired horror movies.,2022-04-06
"This film was exactly what current horror movies should strive for. Ti West has ascended to the ranks of a horror master by giving us this gem. He takes many typical horror tropes and somehow flips them all on the head to give them new life in an honest way. It was the perfect balance between fun and campy, and suspenseful and gruesome without being too vicious. And most importantly it excels in the number one rule that many of the modern horrors forget to include in their attempt to convey the message - it's actually scary! The story communicates universally relevant themes using a tight narrative style that demonstrates that films can still explore important issues without taking themselves too seriously. These types of movie gems restore my faith in the horror genre.",2022-04-17
"This is a poor movie with « false-creative » features that don't bring anything (cut scenes switching to next context twice, so horrible and useless)...
The old woman isn't credible, the porn is the way for the movie to set a red line but too long scenes and poor effects. Really, scenario is predictable with the woman at first against the principle of pornstar into a relationship. This is so boring...",2022-05-29
"I was really impressed with this film making a nice change from the common jump scarey ghosts and zombies.A great setting and intriguing premise brings you a great film that's not to be missed , lots of good scares , gore and tension as well as an interesting dynamic between the cast.Speaking of the performances all around were great , Jenna ortega proving once again she's got what it takes to be a horror icon.If you want a horror that's different to the norm and is outside the settings you're used to then this is not to be missed.Me and my partner really enjoyed this film and we can't wait to see the prequel!",2022-10-30
"A group of film makers rent a cabin on a farm to shoot an adult film.The cast is good. Brittany Snow (Pitch Perfect series), is my favorite of the cast. The cast also includes Mia Goth, Kid Cudi, and Jenny Ortega (who I liked on here Saturday Night Live appearance).The movie moves along pretty slow for my taste. It could have used some trimming. You have to be careful when you go over 90 minutes on this type of films.""X"" really isn't that gory, or that nasty considering the subject matter of the film. I've watched to it twice. Sometimes you like something better the second time around.Again, it's worth renting, but ""X"" isn't a film the I'm going to add to my collection.",2023-08-07
"Well.... I can easily say it's unique. Fantastically shot and sometimes downright beautiful. X has quite a few moments of suspense and a great deal of uncomfortable moments. Be comfortable with being uncomfortable or you will not have a good time. The plot is no doubt weird, but I think it's a nice change of pace and great addition to the horror genre.Personally, I really enjoyed it. It's a unique premise and the trailer ruins one good kill, but believe it or not, it didn't show very much . I went in blind and was pleasantly surprised.",2022-03-25
"Like all these modern garbage productions, always trying to influence younger people behavior. The whole movie is relativist around christianity and stuff, with a tone of sarcasm. The characters/plot are pathetic: stupid simp guys, egocentric women and an old psycho couple.",2022-07-24
"Brittany Snow put the 'X' in sex!Besides looking hotter than ever, this amazingly talented Hollywood actress shines in every scene she's in. Literally, sometimes!'X' may be inspired by 'TTCM', but it is its own film, and is original, sexy, and terrifying af! Kudos to veteran film horror genre director, Ti West, who produced, wrote, directed, and edited this film!He directs confidently, every so scene strong and the performances by the entire cast is amazing!He takes the old horror film trope of young people engaging in sexual escapades and then paying for them with their lives, done to the next level!The late 1970's look and feel (small town Texas) is captured masterfully and the slow burn of the engaging story culminates in an orgy of bloodletting! Wow!Shout out to Mia Goth, Jenny Ortega and Kid Cudi for delivering the goods!No spoilers, just watch and hold on for dear life!",2022-07-21
"This is quite a good movie but the 78 awarded by critic reviews is a bit generous in my opinion and the current score of 66 by IMDB ushers seems to fit the bill much better.The extended sex scenes taking up most valuable dialogue hinders character development, leaving most of the characters feeling like cardboard cutouts and you find yourself eventually just waiting to see them start getting killed off in anticipated gruesome ways.And then the deaths were surprisingly underwhelming in a few instances. Without giving away any major spoilers I will say that admittedly there was some decent gore here and there but nothing at all like what you would expect from a film that is literally so exclusively pornographic. There's literally one death that even happens off camera and you only hear a gunshot and body drop. Another death in water happens with only some splashing, gargling and bloody water.. come on!! An average episode of The Boys does far better than these PG-13 demises.",2022-07-26
"I'm still in shock of how much this film fell short for me, especially after seeing and watching reviews for it that only sang its praises. In the last 5 minutes of the movie, all I could think was ""Wait- that's it?""
The characters were shallow, their personalities being nothing past ""sexually liberated"" and Mescudi's character being a war vet. Oh and let's not forget the prude church girl who never speaks but suddenly wants to be a pornstar after seeing porn live once.Many of their deaths were completely lacklustre and unoriginal, apart from maybe the first. What couldve been a unique twist on Texas Chainsaw Massacre and other classic slashers ended up being a sex-filled, predictable copy. If the director is supposedly ""testing"" the audience and implying that people are afraid of eldery people / bodies then why did you portray the main elderly woman, Pearl, as a sexual predator with the most egregious looking makeup I've ever seen?",2022-07-26
"Not for everyone, but enjoyable if you're a horror lover, who doesn't mind a little porn mixed in. I know many people are not gonna enjoy this, if they're not used to the sex scenes mixed in with gore type of film, also some of the homage is going to go over their head, if they're not into the horror genre. But the writing is good, and I look forward to the sequel/prequel of this.",2022-06-17
"So I came to the movie following Jenna Ortega because her acting mesmerized me in the series Wednesday, the trailer swept me away and it is very well done. It was clear to me that the plot of the film is between a thriller and a horror film. What later turned out to be only a thriller because the scenes are not really scary, and the scenes that are supposed to be scary are on the verge of being ridiculous.The main problem in the film is the fact that the script is not structured in such a way that you can connect with one of the characters in a convincing enough way, there was no depth to the characters and they all remained unresolved. As well as the killer's motive beyond the fact of a mental disorder mixed with jealousy. The script is quite predictable and the murder scenes are not done enough on the border of too fast, except for the first murder scene.The main actress does not get enough stage in the film, and her evolution is pathetic bordering on unbelievable. A very average domestic horror movie overall.",2022-12-18
"This is one of the most disturbing horror films I have ever seen. The old couple were disgusting especially pearl, the old woman also I thought Mia Goth gave a great performance not only as Maxine but pearl as well. I thought the effects and makeup were great, a lot of the killings felt real. This film has a ton of sex and murder in it also if you don't want to see some weird stuff involving nasty looking old people you probably shouldn't watch this movie. Overall I thought this was an excellent horror/thriller with lots of scary and creepy moments and satisfying death scenes.",2022-04-19
"X is a slasher horror with a difference.It's a throwback to 80s slasher movies with a vengeance. Part of the movie has a graininess that makes it look like it was filmed on 35 mm film.For a slasher there's not much gore in this but from what there is it's memorable.A bunch of hippies want to film an x rated movie in the country this exited the elderly bi-curios lady next door sadly her husband can't raise to action, after being rejected by the director she kills him and decides to get some from the ladies.

We were both quite disappointed.The film had some really interesting editing choices that I liked. I also liked some of the cinematography and thought the acting was pretty good all around.Unfortunately the story was completely uninteresting and the characters were very one dimensional. The film lacked any tension whatsoever. Despite the solid acting, I really didn't care what happened to anyone in the film.Very disappointed with this one. Just not for me I guess.

There's definitely intentional or unintentional parallels.I don't think they broken any new ground but they did tell the story they set out to tell with good jump scares, a valiant attempt to build tension, and a pretty good amount of nudity- so if that's your thing, you should enjoy this movie.This isn't high brow horror; and it doesn't try to be.I don't regret watching it, and it's entertaining but I don't think I'd watch it again.",2022-10-31

The movie touches on sensitive topics like growing old, past glory, dementia,... which creates extra freaky scenes at times, never seen before.

"It was refreshing to watch a gory horror movie. Not many of these have been released in the cinema recently. Unlike your typical ""country horror"" scenario, the writers play well around the characters not just leaving the area and going for help. I can see a situation like this playing out in real life, there was nothing taken out of context. The small cast had unique characters that were not bland or annoying, I was sort of rooting for everyone.",2022-03-25
"I've noticed it has become quite common for art produced in the 21st century to play it safe. Be it by being PC or by settling for the same old formula of the genre it's trying to replicate, but being self-conscious about it. X does both, but with the confidence of a superior art form.The result is a contradictory movie: it attempts to comment on social issues (but achieves nothing more than a couple nods at certain general themes) whilst following in the steps of its exploitative predecessors. Due to that, when Ti West (writer and director) presents us with the themes he is supposed to tackle, it's not clear what he wants to say about them (except in regards to sexual liberation, which is undeniably essential to human happiness and even makes us better people, according to X).Basically, the script of X can be summed up to a couple nods at social commentary and a couple more nods at slashers from the 70's and 80's. Meanwhile, when it attempts originality, it accomplishes nothing more than relishing in unapologetic sexual exploitation, posing self-involved catchphrases as virtue statements, intended only to criticize ""prudish"" people and the religious alike.While the camerawork, direction and editing are quite clever, it feels heavily self involved, because the contents of the film do not justify such convoluted technicalities. The soundtrack makes up for a pretty good playlist, but that is nothing more than a cheap trick to make the viewer feel some unearned affection for the movie. All in all, form does not elevate the content. If there is nothing to be said, it doesn't matter how beautifully you say it, it is still nothing. X is basically the cinematic equivalent of a rebellious teen using empty pretentious discourse to criticize that which doesn't please them.",2022-08-01
"This was too grisly for my taste, but I enjoyed it. Don't think I would watch again because it was disturbing enough at parts that I just don't care to remember. Loved the 70's styling. Really funny at parts, too. Definitely recommend it to horror fans who can stomach it.",2022-06-09

"X
Ti West directed X (2022) his fifth film; not including his portion of VHS. It stars Mia Goth (Susperia:Remake), Brittany Snow (Pitch Perfect), Jenna Ortega (Jane the Virgin), Martin Henderson (Strangers), Owen Campbell (My Heart Can't Beat Unless You Tell it To), Stephen Ure (The Hobbit), and Kid Cudi (We Are Who We Are).Peter Phok and Jacob Jaffke have produced West Before. Kevin Turen produced my positively mentioned Villians and Waves. Sam Levinson produces Euphoria. Ashley Levinson produced Green Knight. The team from A24 is why I'm even watching Ti West. Seems X is West's big shot.It's 1979 and 6 wannabe pornographic filmmakers set of for Texas in a fly trap horror film to produce a porno a decade late for porn chic. The film is bookended by a televangelist preaching about his daughter being taken by a world of sun, which means while we play who dies next as horror aficionados often do, we get to figure out which of three characters is the preacher's daughter. Is it Maxine (Mia Goth) a girl longing to become a superstar through porn, Brittany Snow (Bobby Lynne) a veteran porn star who treats it as just a job, and of course, Jenna Ortega (Lorraine) the virginal girlfriend of RJ the director and candidate for last girl status/ McGuffin.They're making a movie called the Farmer's Daughter; either a reference to the world's oldest dirty vaudevillian era joke or based on Ti West's age homage to Mr. Show's first episode. Wayne is the producer and dating Maxine, promises to make everyone a star, but seems more like a voyeur. Jackson is the porn stud. RJ as aforementioned is the director.I call this a fly trap horror and not a slasher because like Texas Chainsaw Massacre they victims walk into a place, are given rules, choose not to follow the rules, and get punished, but a little research and we can couple fly trap with serial killer lore.Enter the villains: Howard and Pearl. Howard hints at the rules: 1. I need help doing maintenance and upkeep, 2. Stay away from my wife she isn't well. 3. There's alligators in the nearby lake, ravine, pond (it's referred as each). 4. Don't do anything sinful.Well they're wannabe porn stars so 4 is broken, their self absorption into stardom ignored rule 1, the wife is a horny peeping Tom so that's on her, and it's hot in summer I'm Texas so you need to take a dip in the alligator pond.What I'm starting to like with Ti West is he seeks out headline news or conspiracy theories and creates fictionalized adaptations of horrible events. House of the Devil while paying homage to The Tenant is making fun of the Satanic Panic craze of the 1970s-80s. The Sacrament adapts the Jonestown Massacre, which should've just done the actual historical event; I'm my opinion. Innkeepers is the outlier. X also adapts real events, but with A24 producers reeling West in its first fully realized foray.It's adapted from the Ray and Faye Copeland killings. They essentially defrauded people of livestock dealings and killed whoever found out throughout the 1980s in Missouri. The last count is 6 murders buried in shallow graves on their farm. Ray claimed self defense. Fate claimed abuse by Ray gave her no choice. The jury gave a verdict otherwise based on trophies, one of which a quilt made from the bloody clothes of the people they slayed. As of 2022 they are the oldest couple given the death penalty in US history.In the case of X Ray is swapped out with Howard, played by Stephen Ure with heavy latex to make him look Ray. Faye is now Pearl.This film is potentially about Howard and Pearl's longing for youth through sexual fulfillment vs the potential of wasting the opportunity of youth indicated by the choices of the porn peddlers (West likes that word: Peddler. See Innkeeper's and X's gas station for proof). There's a group therapy session midway through the film where the porn peddlers engage in this very stardom dream with one another as the Proxy Copeland's peep on.And yes they peep. Every nude moment, and there's several, Pearl is in the periphery enjoying the show. They play Daddy televangelist 24/7, who should've been played by Gene Jones (Father from The Sacrament). How cool would that be even though I'm not a Sacrament fan per se, it would be a funny nod.Is there a depth? One part of me says I'm going to deep on an ok film. The other part is saying, I like Ti West and it's great to see him making a fully realized coherent story.Let's put it this way. Like Texas Chainsaw Massacre this could interpreted as just a slasher with no other purpose than cool kills and a body count. However, Texas Chainsaw Massacre us about the effects of Stagflation of rural Texas specifically during a time when the nation focused on Vietnam, integration, Watergate, Hippies, Manson etc. People went hungry. Factories closed all over the country. As people protested the Vietnam war the rust belt grew to infect the nation. Essentially, from the Sawyers' Family perspective Texas Chainsaw Massacre is about survival from starvation and poverty.X is potentially thoughtful per the group therapy rap session and scene to scene juxtapositions g of youthful sexual exuberance vs the Copeland family's longing. Especially given the odd choice of having Mia Goth play Pearl and Pearl's youthful target of longing Maxine.Or West is so excited with the good reviews for his technical film making that he wanted to prove this felicity for filming doubles on the screen with Goth acting and fight with herself as Pearl and Maxine.Oh, and there's an alligator.The West Thesis: the loves the juxtaposition of age vs youth. It's in every movie.What I would change:
I'd purposefully do the tie-ins from his other movies. Why not? Ti West Cinematic universe.",2022-07-24
"While this movie begins by playing on classic tropes and does have a slightly unique take on the slasher style horror movies, it ultimately ends up feeling uninspired and feels like it stops dead in its tracks. There's very little character development, keeping the characters unforgettable and is borderline plotless. Nothing really makes you afraid in any shape or fashion. The only thing the movie actively tries to do is make you uncomfortable but even then you're just watching with a ""really"" attitude from the shear stupidity that is on display.

The main characters in this are the old weary sexual Pearl and her husband.

"Lurid bloodbath about a film crew that arrives at an out-of-the-way farmhouse (in a movie like this, what other kind is there?) to shoot a porn flick--or, in the words of the executive producer, ""a good dirty movie."" No sooner do they shoot a handful of scenes than the lights go down, the stars come out...and everyone associated with ""The Farmer's Daughter"" begins getting slaughtered like cows in a slaughterhouse. The long, ominous shots of the farm and the woods surrounding it conjure up just the right amount of dread, the jump scares come exactly when you'd expect them to, and the points the film seems to be making--about the evils of porn (there's a real Bible Belt sensibility at work here) and even the dangers of senior sex--make perfect sense (heavy-handed though they may be) and might even elicit a chuckle or two. But ultimately, the whole thing comes across as an unsavory mash-up of legit porn and slasher porn and may leave you wincing instead of applauding. The FX are good, and the make-up--true horror buffs who are already looking forward to the upcoming prequel ""Pearl"" will know exactly what I'm referring to--is great. Otherwise, unfortunately, ""X"" is an X-ercise in X-cess. Here's hoping ""Pearl,"" even if it's no less bloody, is better.",2022-09-06

Ti West also done a good job in directing part . The brutality has shone in the last 45 min is decently innovative and finely executed. If i come to the thematical part then each character in the film represents types of mindsets in our society towards sex . Every character have their own dynamics especially pearl and max.

"Synopsis: A group of young adults rent a farmhouse from an elderly couple to film an adult movie and get more than they bargained for... Blood, guts and gore.Story 4/5: Firstly, the reasoning for these young adults to get into their horrifying situation is unique and really fun to watch unfold. The movie gave me essences of From Dusk Till Dawn where the movie starts off one way and then twists halfway through to something you did not expect. In regards to the trailers, they never give anything away and to be perfectly honest I thought the movie was going to go one way and it definitely took a turn to the macabre. There are some tonally different scenes between the adult film making and the horror elements that really stick out to me with a skewed image of the world. I could also see some imagery and story points that reminded me of the horror classic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre that really put a smile on my face with this film obviously being a love letter to these types of films in this era. Interestingly, I think this story isn't for everyone but it definitely was for me and this was only elevated by the great characters and acting.Acting 4/5: Mia Goth (A Cure For Wellness, Suspiria) was absolutely mesmerising in the 2 roles (yes 2 roles) that she played in this movie. Her line deliveries and mystique of her characters really shone through and got me totally invested in what her character(s) were all about. She isn't the only highlight as I think Jenna Ortega (Scream, You) has become a new scream queen in the horror genre as she puts 110% into her acting. All other cast members were really good and were likeable to the point that I got attached enough so that when they get killed off one by one, I was absolutely gutted to see certain characters go. The likeableness is apparent straightaway with the tight script and each character had their moment to shine, especially with Martin Henderson (Strangers: Prey at Night, Everest) who seems to be inspired by the way Matthew McConaughey acts in his movies and taking on that persona in an entertaining fashion.Visuals 4.5/5: With a great slasher film there must always be great gore effects and this movie had mountains of brilliantly creative gore effects from a stab to the neck to jaws hanging quite literally on a thread. If you are here for the gore, then you won't be disappointed as there are genuine cringeworthy moments which will make you wince at the screen in disgust. Another notable part of the effects is the makeup which looks absolutely wonderful on Pearl (the old woman in the movie) and will sicken and disgust you in every single way. The cinematography that is present in this film is superb and beautiful to look at with some inspired camera movements which know when and where to be in certain scenes. There are certain moments in the movie that could genuinely be posters to present in your house, they are so beautiful. Also visually the way that the adult movie making scenes are captured is brilliantly photographed and feels genuine. There is a certain filter that is used throughout the film that gives it an almost grind house feeling but unfortunately it doesn't quite hit the mark with how a grind house film is usually portrayed. The director Ti West (The House of the Devil, V/H/S) and the cinematographer Eliot Rocket (The Innkeepers, Mr Mercedes) should be proud of the product they created.Editing 3.5/5: When I heard that A24 were releasing this movie I got worried as it is well known that A24 make slow burn horror movies that are unfortunately like marmite to most people (you either love it or you hate it). I can say that even though the movie does have a slight slow burn, it is not excruciatingly slow to the point where you get bored. There are certain scenes that could be considered long and overdrawn but I personally liked the slow burn aspect to the mystery of the older couple. Some scenes were drawn out to make you feel uncomfortable and I applaud the filmmakers on editing choices of the film that made the horror elements truly terrifying. Each scene feels concise and purposeful with genuinely frightening imagery. Unfortunately, not everyone likes these slow burn, almost methodically edited films, so that is the reason why I have knocked it down a few points for people expecting a studio movie such as The Conjuring.Sound 4/5: Each sound aspect of this movie works in it's favour with the eerie soundtrack from Tyler Bates (Atomic blonde, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2) which draw you into the disturbing and frightful scenes. Not only is the original soundtrack great but the regular music fits scenes perfectly and sets the time period respectably. Also, the sound effects are effective and send shivers up your spine and moments of silence really amp you up for what is going to happen next.Summary: A brilliantly shot film with some solid performances, especially from Mia Goth and Jenna Ortega, make this movie very memorable. Its spine tingling moral and its disturbing imagery is absolutely burnt into my retinas and I would definitely consider this a modern classic in horror movies. Unfortunately, I don't think this movie is for everyone and I definitely had this feeling when watching the movie and seeing other people reactions. Will definitely be watching this one again with the knowledge of what is to come before me.Overall: 4/5.",2022-04-01
I have seen a lot of A24s innovative horror movies. A24 has become synonymous with great movies in the horror genre. I had my hopes set with this one thinking that this could be the TCM of this decade. It was an utter disappointment to see that the first 50 minutes or so was a handbook on how to make a porno in the 70s instead of character building. The slasher part of if was taken directly from the old 80s and has been seen several times before. The twist that A24 incorporates in their movies is this time predicting and adds no greater value to the story.,2022-04-16

"Whoever green-lighted this project needs a Nobel Prize for being deliriously optimistic about everything.From the script itself to the unlogical characteristics and storyline, this was total waste of time and nerves!

"The story unfolds quite well, we are introduced to the characters and introduces us to these two terrifying old men perfectly.I think the plot and what can be analyzed from it is great.The old lady is the best part of the movie.But honestly all this is destroyed with this ending.I literally felt a little empathy for the elderly psychopaths and for the first young man to die, than for everyone else.Terrible 'final girl', an unpleasant girl and you don't feel anything for her throughout the movie.Very dry and simple murders for a slasher that was so overrated at the beginning.SPOILERS:
The ending is stupid, I don't know what I intended. The old man's death looks silly and empty, it would have been a little more original if he died at the climax while he was having sex with his wife for the last time.Ti West built a good idea but it ends fatal, a pity.",2022-04-19
After watching countless horror flicks it was great to be taken back to the classic 80s slasher style horror. To me personally the first half of the film was a cinematic masterpiece and could've went in any horror trope direction then the killings kicked in and it was fun as hell to watch. It didn't need to make sense because its a fun slasher type horror film. Don't go in expecting something like hereditary and you won't be disappointed.,2022-05-26
"Fun and well-made and everyone plays their part perfectly for what the auteur is seeking, at least from what I can gather. My main thought I kept having though was, this decrepit elderly couple that keeps talking about how old and tired they are sure have way more energy than people half their age, what with all the running around in the middle of the night, getting up to myriad violent hijinks. I'm in my late 40's and I wish I had their gumption to get up and go. But it still didn't necessarily detract from the moodiness of the entire piece, which I'm just throwing a wild guess out there, is a sort of meta homage to Texas Chainsaw Massacre that aims to turn that sub genre of horror somewhat onto its ear. I guess it got there.",2022-10-15
"Well, this movie is not good! I only gave 2 stars because of the good cinematography!Sometimes the Directors get so full of themselves that they try to reinvent the wheel ...this movie should be a straight forward slasher, but someone thought that it should be more...and that's the mistake!The x-rated movie plot is just there for being there...goes nowhere, or maybe is somekind of metaphor I didn't understand...but in the end of the day, does absolutely nothing to move the plot forward!The movie also is clearly pretentious and tries to tackle ""complex"" themes like sexuality, beauty, getting old, etc...but then again, nor does this make any difference moving the plot forward, and also no one cares (it's a slasher movie godammit)!The final result is a movie that tries to be two things at the same time and succeeds at none!",2022-04-16
"I should not be writing this review but I will anyways, hope you all do not judge me, folks. This is a movie to be remembered. A number of totally straight folks go film a porn in a farm? Old secluded people will try to murder them? Does not get better than this. The plot is well built and once we reach the climax, it all go downhill quite fast, no beating around the bush. Sex, violence, farm and a dream to succeed. Porn is a devil worshipping thing, fellas. Now, is the youth all you got in life? Where do you see yourself from here to 20 years ahead? Moral lesson?

"Very 70s, beautiful composition, cool actors, film prints quality, no cheap monsters just creepy old people, some good music, some simulations from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre but not inferior at all, and actually the point of this film is kinda deep, unlike most horror movies just hitting the blood and violence with no points. I'm happy to find this movie during my Shanghai lockdown disaster 2022 lol... Just a little suggestion if the director or producer can read this, I think this anamorphic look is not necessary to fit 1.9:1 ratio, if I film this movie, I'll use normal spherical lenses to make a 3:2 ratio like A Clockwork Orange or use anamorphic lenses to make a 2.4:1 cinemascope ratio; I guess the director guy wanted the vintage cinematic look so he chose to go on anamorphic lenses? Just open the whole field of footages if it's possible and let that anamorphic beauty out plz or it's so wasted, I really hope you guys to remake post production this way for the 2nd version.",2022-04-20

"Went into this with a lot of optimism, walked away full of disappointment.The first 70 minutes nothing happens. Literally. It's not ""building the tension"". It's a bunch of people go to a farm house and shoot a porn. That's it.Then some gore occurs but it's pretty tame and extremely predictable. The ""horror"" is simply ""Aren't old people gross?!

"I liked the suspense and religious mystery behind this movie, the acting is much more than I expected from a horror. Some of the scenes are nasty and original, but sadly I could not say the same for the plot. We have already seen slashers like this 1000 times before and it was obvious from the very beginning which person is going to survive. About all the slow burners in the last period, I really can't understand what is the deal there, we should all fall asleep till the movie actually starts?",2022-04-14
"One of the best horror films in recent years. You got the perfect 70s grindhouse pseudo porn look, weird camera angles and music, a tremendous cast and characters (and the lead girl makes her job double as good!). And the main thing: an interesting plot that takes its time to complete the transformation from sleezy pseudo porn into a brutal gory slasher not to stall the audience but because THIS slasher is not only out for blood but for some deeper subtext too that need the time and space to unfold properly until it's ready to release the carnage. You don't see something like that often in a horror flick other than as an on the nose plot device. Here it's owned and cleverly embodied so that you can think about ""X"" from more than one angles. Well done, Mr. West. Well done!",2022-04-27

"A bunch of kids find a creepy barn to shoot an adult film; and get more than they bargained for.The premise of this film is unpleasant, the plot and characters are pretty unpleasant and what happens turns out to be more than unpleasant.Die hard horror fans might enjoy this as it jangles nerves throughout and boasts it's fair share of jump scares.However as with most films like this it all feels rather inevitable and there's not really anything new here at all.The seventies vibe is nicely done and the hand held footage looks great.However there's not enough about this film to strongly recommend.",2023-10-04
"Didn't know what to expect. Just heard it was horror. I thought it was a lot better than I was expecting it to be. Story was good. 1979 era. So it's back in time before The Adult Industry we know today. It gave creepy stalker us vibes. Thought it was shot very well. Few sex scenes but they are making ""An Adult Movie"" in the film. Not over blown nudity. Concern begins when someone goes to check on someone. First 35-40 minutes is setting up to the ""Movie"" they are making. Little drama here jealousy there.... Then it just gets going! Really enjoyed the movie. Rumors have it they are planning a sequel prequel.... Looking forward to that if it comes. If not that's fine. But very good movie and enjoyed more than I thought.",2022-04-17
"Could have been better. A rural slasher movie which lacks tension, atmosphere, menace. Adds nothing new or worthwhile to the genre. The acting is poor the storyline trite. The start of the film shows the aftermath of what happens, the Sheriff is asked to look in the basement his face shows shock, horror cut to close up the real story then starts. At the end of the film expecting a return to the start by seeing what the Sheriff saw and maybe some shock twist we get nothing.",2022-08-07
"We watched the prequel first, and I have to say - knowing Pearl's story ahead of time allowed us to understand X much better than if we hadn't. Pearl should have been released first, and X as the sequel - X would have made a LOT more sense. X on its own is just weird, gross, and disturbing. Maybe that's what the director was going for? If so - mission accomplished! Pearl was on another level - we really enjoyed that one a lot. Mia Goth is a great actress and really showed her range in that film. Not so much in X.Other than that, pretty standard slasher with all of the usual elements and over the top gore. Very slow moving at first with gratuitous shock-value murder scenes and the usual final girl formula.",2023-09-18

"Absolutely stunning scenery. Terrible story. It made zero sense, they didn't even try to keep any type of suspension or create an interesting plot. However I am still glad that I watched it. Some of the acting was superb, the images amazing, the zeitgeist beautifully portrayed, the humor well done and of course the scary part of Southern US(which is just so wonderful for horror) handsomely filmed and brought right to your doorstep. So yeah, definitely worth it. Some funny irony as well looking at the occupation of the main characters and how they are able, unlike the writers for this movie, to produce a quality story line in a genre that usually doesn't do quality. It looked so good it made me wonder if I will ever be able to see something that good in that type of genre ;)",2022-04-26

"Ti West's X is many things, it is: a return of a full-throttle slasher, Ti West's first horror feature since 2013 as well as being A24's first ever slasher feature, which would be shifty followed by Bodies Bodies Bodies and X's own prequel, Pearl in the same year.Perhaps where X finds it's mastery is in how it both respects and embraces classic slasher tropes and formats while reinventing them as well. The movie opens like no other slasher movie before it, opening to the morning after the killings. The police at the scene, walking on blood stained floors which are littered with covered dead bodies before finding something disturbing in the basement below, all of that just before the audience is greeted with a title card of '24 Hours Earlier'. This ingeniously creates a claustrophobic time packet of tension for the reminder of the feature as the audience is has an estimate how many will die and where they will die but are left clueless as to who will it be and when it will happen. Furthermore, this adds to the mystic of who will survivor during the third act as once half the group is gone, the writing and camerawork of the movie suggests it could be any of the three remaining.The script is simply immaculate, expertly playing with the themes of the correlation between age and worth as well as the rise of independent filmmaking. Every scene is important and necessary. The characters are given depth and dialogue beyond the clear slasher trope in which they represent, each death not only foreshadowed but standing as a genius metaphor for each character's shortcomings or arc so therefore when a character's time comes, their death doesn't feel rushed or like it cheated in audience, it feels right as though it was written in fate for the character to pass that way. On a different note, the camerawork is frankly stunning, to the point where every single shot feels like it could be a painting, as well as homaging camerawork techniques of the 1970s era of cinema. The star-studded cast is just perfect. Mia Goth shines in her dual leading role with Brittany Snow and Martin Henderson delivering scene-stealing iconic performances.With X, A24 proves why they are the saviours of modern cinematic art. I cannot encourage you enough to watch X, it is truly a slasher masterpiece which will be looked at by future generations in the same light as the Original 'Texas Chain Saw Massacre' and 'Halloween'. Ti West and Mia Goth truly created something special with this film.",2022-12-04
"The movie has a basic plot, and basic setup. You pretty much know what's going to happen from the beginning. The characters are a little bit over the top, but it plays into the unwinding story that they all have some issues that made them who they are.My biggest issue with the movie is one that I find over and over again: the lame, tone deaf attempts at Texas accents by almost every one of the actors. Mia Goth is from London, but still affects the best semblance of a dialect of any of the rest of the cast. The dude who plays the old man was the worst. His attempt at an accent is silly and cliché. It's to the point where it becomes a distraction, the accents are so bad.All that being said, the tone and pace of the film are enjoyable, and lend to a creepy, sinister mood. While there are very few surprises, the movie is fun, and is a good watch if you're in the mood for a slasher.",2022-10-21
"Had friends over and decided to watch this film. The first hour is completely pointless, with no story and constant awkward sex scenes. The disappointment continues as the characters begin to wonder around the farm at night in their pants in order to help a creepy old man that is carrying a gun and is obviously going to murder them. Things took a turn for the worse when his disgusting old wife and him have gross sex in a bed above a woman that is hiding underneath. One positive is that it is filmed quite well and I enjoyed the old style of footage they used. Other then that don't bother, keep looking...",2022-12-03

"TLDR: This is one of the worst movies out there. Life is short, please don't waste by watching this extemely horrible movie.After seeing sooooo many awards from Rotten tomatoes, this, that, I decided to give this a watch. I was having a very good day, and at the end of the day decided to watch this before going to sleep. What a mistake!I don't even know what to call this. I feel so bad, calling this a ""movie"", it's so bad.There's just weird cuts, frankly a grotesque story, with characters and story that will have you soo bored I can't even begin to explain it. There is no suspense, no horror, just plain boredom and nude shots. The story is just dumb, and based on what this mobe is based on, those things have a better story and characters than this absolute trash.Not at all expected from A24.This is the worst movie I've seen in my life as of now. Save your time, watch something else.",2023-01-14
"First of all I appreciate the entire team for making it to look like an old style horror flick that works really well. Sometimes it gave the vibe of ""Wrong turn"".The plot of this story is that the group of people are going to the mansion which located far away from the city to shoot adult film and what are all the issues they've faced after going there was the remaining story.The main problem is that the horror elements are starting after 1hr. The total duration of this movie is 1hr 46min and last 45mins is really amazing with very good amount of blood, gore and horror effects.And guess what the remaining 1hr was a solo porn movie. If you remove that 45 mins from this movie you can say it's a porn movie. Yes there are also some horror segments but it won't catch your attention.In fact I couldn't accept the justification for this movie given in climax. I think it may vary for person to person.Anyway I think it's a good movie to give a try.",2022-07-17
"This film is as gross and weird as many reviewers have explained. I loved it. The film has a bold and strong style, even Tarantino-like clearness surrounded the gore-fest.

Mia Goth is excellent in the leading role(s).",2022-03-27
"The movie was. Alright. Had high HIGH expectations. At first, this seemed like an artistical type of horror movie.it seemed nice, set in texas of 1979. Everything about this movie was set up nice. A group of young adults set out to be RICH from a triple X movie. The way the camera was transitioning seemed just fine, until they kept over using it. Over suspensing some areas of the movie, senior citizens being able to kill and stab, or the power to handle a powerful fire arm to kill 6 young adults is BEYOND me. I don't know about you but my grandma still needs a cane to even walk. Then talk about the uncomfortable scenes with the grandparents having sex was disastrous. At first, when the grandma killed the guy who was filming the movie seemed fine. Everything past that point was terrible. YUCK. Incredible performances from the actors like Jenna Ortega but terrible writing. Wow. Had the potential, had the perfect actors, perfect scenery, terrible writing. And how wrong this movie is to include religion into this??? A horror about the killing of young adults trying to make a sex tape. Why would you ever bring God to such a movie?",2022-04-15

"This movie was weirdly entertaining. Subjectively, it's a pretty bad film. The writing was at times confusing for me and it definitely was a bit silly. Even though it was subjectively poor, my eyes were constantly glued to the screen. It was extremely fun to watch with friends. A horror movie hasn't made me sit on the edge of my seat as much as this one did. My heart was racing throughout the movie. The retro vibe was also super cool. Entertaining and decently scary, ""X"" will go down as a classic in my books.I definitely think this movie is worth the watch with friends. It's a fun and heart-pumping slasher that will more than likely have you entertained.",2022-10-31

"Review: X (SPOILERS)Ti West delivers a solid but familiar horror outing with X, a clear homage to 70's horror set in rural America and Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in particular.The story - set in Texas - involves a group of people out to make an adult film who rent a barn from an elderly couple in the middle of nowhere circa 1979 .As filming gets underway, the film crew runs afoul of the couple, particularly the wife, a deranged, sexually repressed psychopath named Pearl. Before long, the ground is painted with blood and gore as the couple stalk and kill the filmmakers over the course of one insane night.I'll cut to the chase and break down the pros and cons here:The Good:Ti West again demonstrates his skills as a filmmaker and ability to homage horror subgenres while capturing the feel of the decade which produced them (the 70's here, the 80's for House of the Devil) with strong direction and a decent script. He also manages some really terrific set pieces, including a masterful nail biter involving a woman swimming in a lake, unaware a large alligator is nearby, watching her.He's aided by a terrific cast of legitimately likeable, if somewhat sleazy, characters. The MVP here is easily Mia Goth, who does double time as aspiring star Maxine and the maniacal killer Pearl, the latter of whom is the breakout character of the film, proving herself both deliciously creepy and startlingly capable of laying down brutal murders.When the red stuff starts flowing the kills are outstanding. Gorehounds won't be disappointed. Kudos as well to the soundtrack, which actually has the film ending with ""Bad Case of Loving You"" by Robert Palmer, a decision for which it earns an entire star on my rating.The not so good:For all the raves this film received, I was surprised at how formulaic it actually proved to be. If you've seen movies like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or most rural set horror flicks about city people getting in over their heads with folks who live outside the edges of society, you'll see this entire movie coming.The pacing is problematic as well..I appreciate a good slow burn and for a movie like House of the Devil it works particularly well. But at some point you have to get to the gruesome parts in a movie like this and that doesn't happen until some forty five minutes into a one hour and forty six minute movie.And that's another thing: X didn't need to be this long. West could have trimmed ten minutes easily and ended up with a tighter, better paced film. A lot of the same character beats are repeated before we get to the first murder. Even the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre had the sense to kill a couple of characters in the first half hour.Which brings me to a specific moment I thought didn't work..and to discuss that, I have to warn you:
****MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD*****Jenna Ortega appears as Lorraine, a production crew member apparently dating the screenwriter who decides she wants to be in the film and have a sex scene, over the horrified objections of her boyfriend. The boyfriend is so upset, he actually decides to leave with the van in the middle of the night after the scene is filmed, setting up his murder.This could have been a relatively interesting spin on giving a female character agency and self empowerment ( of a sort...it IS a porno shoot) , but the movie follows on this by having her character be lured into a cellar where she discovers a dead body, get locked in and be all but forgotten until the final few minutes when another character frees her and, in a fit of anger, she screams at the person that she's sorry she got involved in any of this and she hates all of them. Lorraine then follows this by stupidly running out the front door where she is immediately killed with a shotgun blast by Pearl's husband.So not only did she do a complete character turnaround (remember, she wasn't originally in the film, just on the crew, and her filming a sex scene was her own idea) , but she dies because she does something utterly stupid. Her storyline goes nowhere and this turn of events left me regarding her choice to be in the porno movie as nothing more than a plot device to get RJ outside in the van after. It's a pointless scene that bears no impact on the outcome of the film and seems awkward and unnecessary.****""END SPOILERS*****Overall, I did enjoy X quite a bit and in no way consider it a bad film. But I don't think it's the modem classic reviews made it out to be. It takes too long to get going and it's a pretty by the numbers backwoods/rural horror flick, one with at least one completely useless character beat the movie spends too much time on.***1/2 out of ***** I enjoyed X and I recommend horror fans watch it at least once, but I doubt I'll ever watch it again.",2023-07-12
"Love it, love it, love it. Finally another horror movie where you go home afterwards and think what the F have I been watching? It's a really weird movie. The film builds up slowly but works towards a bizarre, gruesome and at times tense ending.

I definitely give it a 9!",2022-03-27

Looking foward to Pearl.I csn't say this one enough, really well acted. Let's face it there are some good ideas out there ruined by terrible acting Or everyone in the movie looks like Instagram models.Though the women in the movie are very attractive but not in a plastic way.They also did a good job or not overdoing the fact they are filming a porn as well.

I hope she continues to work a lot.Jenny Ortega is amazing (what's new). Her character is the glue this film needs (especially in the first half) to tie it to reality and she's really brings it. I do wish her and Mia had more scenes and dialogue together though. A highlight of the film (for me) was her marvelous scream (all who've seen the film will know which one), it was breathtaking and perfect. I hope it didn't take to many takes, because I'm sure her voice would've been fried.The direction was nuanced (as were all the performances) in its beauty, the cuts were jarring (in a good way) and the suspense was kept throughout the film with amazing camera angles and creeping transitions. Many of the camera angles wear perception was altered or added really served to heighten the dread, brilliance, and jarring-nature of many scenes.Also, Kid Cudi was very funny and felt very natural in this role; really a good job, as was the whole cast.",2023-01-31
"A movie that I've always been curious to watch due to positive comments about it, but unfortunately, it fell short.The synopsis that seemed generic is confirmed when you finish the movie.The motivation for the old people to kill due to a lack of sex, connecting to the amount of sex that young people want and have in this movie, makes sense and is something new for the film. But that's it.The direction is good, but nothing stands out. The characters and the script are the main errors. No character is explored properly, and when they die, it doesn't matter much! The main character, when in focus, does well. However, the end of this character is bland, and I did not find what was supposed to be a ""plot twist"" at the end cool.The story is entirely predictable, and every scene already gives away what is going to happen. I even think that was the intention, but for that, the movie should compensate with other things, which it didn't.Practical effects are something to highlight due to the old lady actress (the same one, right) who did an excellent job, both in makeup and in the scenes.The movie doesn't have much gore, just enough for one scene or another. Sex is present in some moments, but at least there is an explanation for it, the production of pornographic films.In summary, while all horror movies with this proposal have young people having sex just for the sake of it and a killer with motivations beyond the characters or just craziness, this movie brings SEX (or the lack of it) as the great villain of the film.",2023-05-10
"Good performances, good production, like its reviews list. But it is rubbish.A little pornographic in portrayal of senseless murder, close to shocking as the Helter Skelter killings. Not really slasher as perverse.",2022-07-10

"X follow six characters who are shooting an adult film on an elderly couple's farm in late 1970's rural Texas. The first scene in the film shows the police discovering the dead bodies, so the audience can expect a bloodbath to follow suit; but the story was an enthralling ride from start to finish, beautifully shot and bolstered by incredible acting performances. There's solid commentary on religion, secular society, and sexual morality - all without sticking our noses in it. Between Kid Cudi's acoustic rendition of Fleetwood Mac's Landslide and the first kill set to Blue Oyster Cult's Don't Fear the Reaper, X might have my favorite music choices of any film ever. There are some questionably graphic images in this film, but overall, they don't detract from the viewing experience. Very solid film from Ti West.",2023-09-08

"@chompcrc here again. I think Ti West just really wanted to pay tribute to 70's porn and porn culture in general with this one. It's not actually a bad movie, it's just not what I wanted it to be. The acting, cinematography, set design, and tone are all great. I wasn't actually expecting so much focus on the porn aspect, but that's on me... the title of the movie is ""X"" after all. I think the horror plot was a bit thin, and most of the kills were wasted. The two alligator scenes, while played for completely different affect, were equally great, and Mia Goth puts on an acting clinic. It was a bit creepy at times, but never actually scary. Maybe I'm desensitized? No matter the good or bad of it, I don't see myself ever watching this again. It's funny, because I've watched ""The House of the Devil"" a dozen times, and it basically relies on aesthetics, with an extremely slow burn, and only finds it's way into horror in the last 20 minutes. While ""X"" has a similar atmosphere, I still feel like his freshman outing is his best. Watch it if you're into atmosphere, slow burn, sex, vulgar language, and good acting. Skip it if you're offended by mature themes and lackluster horror.",2022-07-15

"Just like classic 70s slasher movies this film takes its sweet time to reach its gory conclusion. Most of the film has fun building characters, referencing classic movies from the past, and dropping plenty of foreshadowing into the mix on the way.I don't know why everyone is talking about horror, because it's not. If you're here for Hereditary and the like you'll be disappointed. And although there's a porn-related plotline, it's not sexy (and doesn't try to be) - the porn is mostly played for laughs, and as a counterpoint to some of the anti-porn that's to come.Instead you've got some well-built tension leading to 20 minutes of chaotic, gory slasher nastiness.

"Comically grotesque rednecks contrasted against the beauty of American wilderness with the burgeoning promise of violence. Familiar premise? This has Texas Chainsaw' written all over it, although X does attempt to elevate itself.A discussion of sex through a stylised lense of late-1970s independent fim-making soon comes into focus. The confrontation of sex is simply too banal and binary however, as the film contrasts two extremes: an adult movie production vs the repression of a backwoods couple. The retro-indie direction won't fool any discerning cinema viewer of this, and the heavy gore is too jarring to elicit, at the very least, some camp sensibility which would have been prime for the film's ridiculous pairing. Lucky McKee's, The Woman (2011) manages a good mix of gore an commentary, but knows it is little more than brutal parody.X renders its themes as if they are attempts at subversiveness, seemingly to only legitimise the horror genre. However, at the cost of sympathetic characters or an engaging sequence of events, X ultimately achieves the opposite. Even if it does at times manage a prestige machination of cinematography (the looming alligator sequence is memorable), all the protagonists' deaths are inconsequential. Perhaps the director doesn't want us to view the protagonists as anything more than shallow, and rather our sympathies were supposed to lie elsewhere. Now that's something radical, and a truly a sinister conceit, but X most definitely took too long to get there.",2022-06-21
"""Ti West and some of his best work""Horror movies, as you've always seen it. ""X"" is a film that evokes the best years of horror movies, with the same young and erratic characters, and with the same overexploited story. What makes X a great horror film? Its essence and its way of paying homage to exploitation cinema.This film could easily be the result of mixing the universe of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" together with that of ""Boogie Nights"". It is daring, full of all kinds of tensions, with villains much more interesting than they seem and with horror scenes achieved in an outstanding way. For lovers of the genre, who like to relive the glorious era of this type of cinema, X is an essential card in the horror catalog of 2022. Really very entertaining.""A24 and Ti West don't reconstruct the horror genre, rather, they remind us why we fell in love with this kind of cinema""",2022-05-04
This movie almost hits the mark. I loved the retro cinematic and the actors were great. I loved the porno culture and how they almost pulled off giving Mia Goth two roles. I hated that last scene where you could clearly distinguish that Mia Goth was also playing the old pearl.And i feel like the characters didn't really have to die one after the other like that. The gore will make you cringe.I was going to rate this movie 5 if i hadn't seen the Prequel pearl because pearl had no back story and we had no idea why she hated blonds or why she slept on the bed alongside Maxime.It's a slow burner.,2022-11-16
"Is how Mia Goth is still getting parts--what with her connection to Shia and all his little ""gifts"" he loves to give to unsuspecting women. This is not to say that she should be cancelled.However, from a viewer's perspective, watching her in anything is incredibly distracting--especially roles that are sexual and/or roles that call for nudity. It's like being reminded of the dangers Sex Ed teachers tried to warn you about and being bombarded with a flood of those nasty mental images.",2022-05-02

They have a graphic, partially nude, sex scene with 2 people that look like the crypt keeper 😱 I just through up in my mouth a lil bit thinking about it. Do yourself a favor and watch the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (literally any installment) instead.",2022-07-10
"The beginning had the feeling of a classic slasher set up, and I like how much they went for a similar vibe and formula to a 70s/80s slasher, with no violence until about the mid point and then all violence. I do think the mood and tone of the second half could have been improved, and some of the kills maybe could have been filmed better.The main thing I didnt love about the movie was the actual plot with the killers. It was strange to me and while I could see a campy low budget 80s slasher use this plot line, and I can see why they would go for it, slutty sexed up main characters is classic, let's make the killers sex crazed elderly people, I didn't personally love it and honestly I didn't feel it felt with the higher quality finished product.I still really enjoyed the movie, it was a classic slasher which isn't nearly as common these days, and I would still definitely recommend it to horror, and especially slasher fans. But for myself it just could have been even better.",2023-09-30

"First of all I must say that it is a very original proposal, not many filmmakers dare to talk about porn movies and less in a horror movie.First of all, this film contains somewhat long scenes that do not lead to many places and has little background that helps to better understand and identify with the characters.I liked that it presents scenes of classic psychological horror, but likewise there is no character in which a viewer can identify or trust, which is usually something elementary in horror movies.A funny fact; I imagine the director could hace proyected himself with one of the characters, who constantly acclaims that independent cinema will grow, and ends up leaving us a great message with the sheriff saying that instead of recording any porn movie they should have made a horror one.",2023-04-26
"I enjoyed it although it could be above average.Apart from the porn motto ,I've seen this so many times it just is something made over and over but with a proper package.I tend to be positive and give higher ratings than I really should .Maybe 7 stars is too much but I see effort on many aspects except the writing which doesn't show any holes, by the way. That is remarkable by itself.The acting was good ,the directing and art/tech details were classy as they evoked the 70s well and it was fun to watch.There really isn't anything new to expect from this kind of story but I'm sure along the way, someone will turn it original once again by giving the audience something fresh.I may say it's a good tribute to the genre but don't expect to be surprised much.",2022-04-17
"Ti West, the man that helped bring us VHS and The Inkeepers, returns back to the big screen with, ""X."" When I first saw the trailer for this during a screening of Studio 666, I was immediately intrigued. Not only because it had the A24 banner attached to it, The company that helped to bring us movies such as the Florida Project, Good Time, and The Lighthouse, but it also contained a lot of unique elements to it such as slasher tropes made famous by movies like Halloween, mixed with some of the elements you would see typically laced in me and scream horror movies like Jumpscares or fake outs. However, when I actually viewed the movie, I was left speechless. The cinematography was my favorite part, how it was able to make the movie looks so retro while simultaneously incorporating scenes that looked as if they were filled on a 1970s camera. The transitions are well done giving a compare and contrast to the life of the filmmakers to the life of the farmer and his wife. Then to get the spoilers out of the way, this movie has some of the most classic and unique kills I have seen since the days of Elm Street and Friday the 13th. Lots of blood, violence, fornication, all things you would expect from a horror movie but done in a way that makes you want more. But my favorite part of the movie has to be the overall story. I love how they made it this one big allegory for The sex industry in the 70s and how the main characters live their lives free and full of corruption while the main villain, pearl, is envious of their youth because she is past her prime and not able to do the things she used to because her husband has a heart condition. The only pure character in the movie ends up caving into the corruption she is surrounded in, and the main character fills her life with drugs and sex so she doesn't have to cave into the societal pressures brought in to her world by her father. Another detail I would like to share is that I love that Mia goth plays both Maxine and Pearl. I love how it's the showcase that they are essentially foils or parallels of one another. How Pearl serves as a symbol for everything Maxine doesn't wanna grow up to be. I highly recommend this movie if you love A24 or just slasher movies in general. Definitely looking for to, ""Pearl,"" when it comes out.",2022-03-30
"Now I love horror and thriller movies but i'm pretty picky with the type that entertain me. This film was shocking and for lack of better words, messed up. It was refreshing and a great concept that hasn't been overdone. The acting was fantastic and the writing and the directing kept me on my toes the whole time. I was wildly impressed by this film- which I haven't said about a recent horror movie in a long while. Mia Goth is a fantastic actress and she plays her role very well which just adds to the whole experience of seeing this film. I haven't genuinely gasped out loud while watching a film until I watched this one. I thoroughly enjoyed this one and completely recommend.",2023-03-21
"Overall X manages to capture that feeling of a hot sweaty 70's slasher film most prominently the Texas Chain Saw Massacre, unfortunately, it's also an A24 film so there are some strange editing choices and transitions that don't stick to that 70's style that feels more awkward than anything.This may not be a negative to some but to me, it took me out of the movie a bit, when they're shooting the actual porno there is a real lack of full-frontal nudity which I don't normally care about, it's just if you're shooting a porno in my opinion that's probably something you might want to actually shoot instead of just showing the top half. It is strange that the superhero show, 'The Boys' has more full frontal nudity than a horror film about making an actual porno.The final act of the film though is what really ruins the film for me, what made the original TCM scary is that it took place during the day, seeing blood splattered on a farm door in the middle of a hot summer has a certain style to it that doesn't exist at night. The gore is fun but nothing too original, if they had stuck to the 70's style and had the whole movie taken place during the day I might have loved this film. It's still a better TCM sequel than any of the actual TCM sequels though so I guess congrats.",2022-10-20

"This movie reminded me a lot of Rob Zombie's House movie 31, but just the first 15 minutes or so. Because the characters are a good natured crew of 70's road-tripping performers, that kind of are friends and kind of not.In a way, this like a Rob Zombie movie that replaces the awful Rob Zombie dialogue with boring dialogue.And of course, Rob Zombie has been remaking Texas Chainsaw Massacre little by little across his movies, and this movie, very authentically filmed in Texas, has several little references to TCM, and like TCM, it has a lot of heart and unusual villains that are human but are very far gone from normalcy.So this movie is like if you replaced the murderous family from TCM with the murderous grandparents from The Visit.",2022-06-20
"Legit watched this film in 2× speed. Gruesome and pornography only. Storyline was too boring. Slow movie at start and then expected plot twists. How that old woman got killed is still a big question for me. That's why just rated 2 stars only. She legit gun shot that girl and how she even died!? Also the motive for killing of that old woman was not clear. At first it seemed she only wanted sex that's why she killed that innocent guy. Yeahh on that point, my heart break when he was killed. He already had gone through a heart break and that innocent guy gets killed. Infact Maxine or that blonde girl should get killed first. Or maybe that girl who cheated for sex. Yeahh but tht innocent guy should also disagree with others. Makes sense, whatever. Continuing talking abt movie, 1st motive was understood that she wants sex, and those who denies she kills. But she never asked the other guy. And why was even her husband involved in killing? So many questions just don't make sense. Only a good thing was they showed a guy's dick and yeahh i am rating it one more star for not only sexualizing female's body(Yeah me a feminist). Was also expecting a horror element as mentioned in the horror category. Good things was how Maxine escaped and tried to help that girl, teenagers actually caring for other people. Just u do sex doesn't make u a bitch. They all were there for old lady to help. Also was she a lesbian? Doesn't she wanted sex with a guy. Why Maxine then. Just a ques but maybe she was appreciating her beauty idk. Ans she so naive to act like she wasn't guilty to kill ppl. Liked how maxine rode the truck over her. And she wasn't a sex figure when she got a fiancee. Her dialogues and attitude seemed like villian at first and tht shy girl a helpful one. Whatever, in short a below average movie as gruesome and pornography only.",2022-10-08
"It was a fun watch, but I don't think I'll be compelled to watch it again. Leading up to seeing it, I read/heard many comparisons to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Yeah, there were allusions or homages, but it's definitely it's own unique film, story, and character set. Lots of current socially charged undertones, which I thought were presented in an original and compelling way. The overall look had an interesting style.

Is RJ still dead in front of the van, or is he hanging in the cellar with his pants pulled down? Or is the body in the cellar somebody else entirely?

"I would give ""X"" a 6.5 if I could, as I do think it's above average, but not good enough to warrant a 7 or above. This is not a bad film at all, it's just simply not up my alley.The characters, while excellently acted, are rather bland and we don't learn much about them before they are killed off. The main antagonists weirdly enough have more substance than the main group we're supposed to care about. The film is also slightly annoying in that it pretends to be deeper than what it really is, which again, wouldn't be an issue if the leads had some more meat. The characters are not bad, just lacking.Other than that, the film gets almost everything right. The cinematography is as excellent as we've come to expect from an A24 production. The atmosphere of the film is extremely well done. The pacing is masterful. This film is only roughly 1hr40min, yet it still manages to build up to the action much more satisfyingly than big budget action flicks. Due to the great pacing and great special effects, the kills have excellent payoff even in their at-times campy brutality. The wardrobe was eye-catching and period accurate. Lastly, the acting is great. Everyone gave a stellar performance and worked well with what they were given.So overall do I think ""X"" is a good film? Yes. Is it a film I will be returning to? No. This isn't the kind of horror I am tantalized by, but I do recommend it for people who are into the slasher genre and want to see it take on a more arthouse vibe.I will be giving ""Pearl"" a watch though!",2022-11-10
"This can't really be called a slasher or a porno. I'm confused as to the intent of the film here other than wanting to showcase female nudity from Brittany Snow and Mia Goth. This will draw in cis male viewers. But the storyline is a bore.A bunch of young 20 something's want to shoot a porno at (basically) an Air BnB. Would I say the nude scenes are artistically done? Maybe i dont have an eye for that but it really just felt like a gimmick.Later on in the film the old woman who is renting out the Air BnB to them (not really an air BnB bc this is set in like the 80s), is feeling sexually frustrated and neglected by her husband, so she wants to get in on the action too. But she ends up being creepy/evil and killing all of them but Mia Goth.Then at the end you find out Mia Goth's character is this pastor's daughter who ran away from home and decided to take charge of her own destiny or something.I don't know...no real point to this except for nudity and death. Not very good....",2022-12-18

But... there is just no real tension.I will of course go see the prequel, that I hope will make this movie more make more than a homage to the classics.",2022-04-10
"The film starts in 1979 following a group of young sex workers and a camera crew (a cameraman and his girlfriend) headed out to the middle of nowhere to shoot an adult movie in the hopes of getting rich from it. From there the movie is somewhat of a slow burn. With a good few suspenseful moments and jump scares building until the inedible first kill. Leads to a series of multiple gruesome deaths, definitely not for the weak-hearted.Overall this film was very enjoyable and possibly one of my favorite horror movies I've seen in a while. It gave the feel of a classic 70s slasher film but with a few nice twists sprinkled throughout.",2022-04-03

It might be the type of movie to watch on a date or when you have company if you don't really care about watching the movie at all.It wasn't the worst thing in the world, but I usually only watch certain types of horror.

"That this movie brings a good point to how confusing can be to have sex for make a living and to date for real with someone at the same time. Lorraine was't necessarily someone who stares everyone. Since the beginning she was observing how people who make porn relate to each other, just like 'how can they be normal?', so her voyeur side was activated live and she had sure they are... 'normal' as herself.Also to the point that it is easier when you are taping and having fun in the background when it is not your girlfriend which never did it. Not everyone is capable of that. It can make you change from cheerful to want to abandon.Lorraine saw freedom, even more when the actors talked about their vision of sexuality.Regarding to the story, it has a great cinematography (what a beautiful place with the pond) and is original. The guts, gore, corpses effects are in shape! And at the end: life beats death, and keep taking the risk of coke.I used to have Horror as a favorite but there are too many bad movies. Probably the genre with more repetitive subjects.If this world last, for me it will be a classical.",2022-05-28
"X is a slasher movie, with several references to others of the same genre, what I am amazed, was the story of the movie that is the differential of any other slasher movie. I don't consider it the perfect movie, but it's a good movie that plays with its subgenre all the time and that left me feeling satisfied after seeing a good slasher movie after so long, X takes a little bit of each slasher movie and mixes it up into something good, the cast is extremely good and Mia Goth gives a show of acting playing pearl and maxine, really a good movie for fans of a good slasher. But I recommend taking the movie rating seriously.",2022-09-30
"This was one of the most well put together movies I have seen. The plot is quite simple, and even before watching it you expect you have some idea of what to expect: A sexy horror film. And this movie gives you that. Sex and murder. But beyond that you have a internal conflict with the main character, become a star. She struggles with drugs and is caught up in a less then favorable lifestyle. But she has strong self talk and that is seen throughout the movie. Two other characters in particular go through some changes. One you could call it a growing pain of acceptance. And the other.... the desire to be free. The killers have this kind of sick ritual that isn't totally revealed until the end of the show. I wouldn't call it a twist, but its a nice tie in. The only thing I really didn't like about this movie is... well what I don't like about most horrors. That characters could have taken alternative actions to stay alive. But hey that's part of this genre. I thought that flow of the movie was smooth and the script was well written. Not game changing. Just an excellently told story. Highly recommend.",2022-07-27
"Half decent B Movie - ultimately silly but no doubt there will be some kind of sequel or low quality franchise.Kind of in the Texas Chainsaw massacre style where several young people end up in a backwater , renting out a house connected to farmhouse where an old couple live. Then it's relatively formulaic from thereon in.Production values are pretty good and also the acting is OK. It's a slightly different kind of slasher movie so it has that going for it. I guess it's quite low budget so it's never going to be top notch.I would say watch it once and then forget it completely. TBH, there are many many worse films out there.",2023-01-05
"Ti West, the new King of the Slow Burn (see: House of the Devil), is quickly becoming one of horror's greatest ambassadors. At just 41 years old, he's transforming the genre altogether. And although he doesn't want to be known as such (he's said this much), fans of the oft-flawed back section of the video store, we know better.His impressive catalog already contains 09's Devil, ""The Innkeepers"" (2011), the ""Second Honeymoon"" segment in V/H/S (2012), ""The Sacrament"" (2013), & ""In The Valley of Violence"" (2016). Enter 2022's ""X,"" an expertly crafted tip-of-the-cap to 70's era exploitation films. With its sexual liberation style, in the form of back-alley porn, it's easy to get lost in what you're watching. Is this a horror film or something conjured up from Paul Thomas Anderson and Quentin, written on a napkin, in a coffee shop back in the early 90's- for use at a later date? And of course, it too, is a slasher film. Of the highest order no less. But that comes later. Way Later. It's old vs young, faded beauty vs exuberant youth, religion vs we'll worry about the afterlife later, and the cycle of life - All wrapped up tightly - somewhat masquerading as a film Hollywoodites would greet with warm hugs and a barrage of Late Night TV invites to West & his Entire cast. Not exactly something La-La Land tends to bestow on the ""horror"" community.It's not, thank goodness, a nod to time travel (though it might get to feeling that way, if you really start to ask yourself, ""WAIT! What the hell is going on here?""). Maxine, played to perfection by Mia Goth, is confident in her own skin. And why not? She's at the peak of her youth and beauty, which is why Pearl (also played by Goth - totally unrecognizable with prosthetics & caked-on makeup) loathes her so. Or maybe it's envy? Maybe it's both? Pearl ""used to be a dancer,"" but those days older than her reflection in the mirror. And after 45(ish) minutes of building tension & bubbling intensity, ""X"" is spinning rapidly toward WTF territory. And I mean that in the best way possible.Finding out the next day, that ""X"" is part of a Ti West trilogy, quite frankly, made me want to get neked and join the smut party. ""Pearl"" is a prequel, set in a 1910 WW1 era and starring Goth again (in the title role -- which many viewers will have to Find Out after watching ""X,"" as it's not exactly slap-you-in-the-face that it's her underneath all of that get-up).This film is a Masterclass! And oh my the way, we don't have to wait - like we so often do in a trilogy. ""Pearl"" has already been teased and announced by West himself. And it's hurdling to a theater near you later this year.""Farmer's Daughter,"" by the way, was an Actual 58-minute 1976 porno. It's brainchild (in our movie anyways), is Wayne, played by Martin Henderson. He sums the whole ""X"" experience up, quite nicely:
""We're gonna be rich! Feel how hard my c$%k is!""",2022-06-01
"I always said a horror movie with plotholes is just wasting time to watch . I love realism and logic in horror movies , one of the best Example of the great horror movie is ( Get Out ) .But also this movie didn't have too much Plotholes which I like it somehow.",2022-04-18
Very good movie that exceed my expectations. I think we all didn't have super high hopes for this movie but it was very creepy and unsettling. Did not expect to enjoy the movie and the aspects it brought. Nothing to crazy just very good movie for horror night!,2022-07-23
This movie was very creative. I haven't seen a slasher movie this good in a while. The plot twist was cool. It might have been a little disturbing and inappropriate but I enjoyed it. Maybe definitely not a first date/date movie.,2022-03-31
"Will the innocent virgin girl be the final girl? The film takes those old 70s slasher horror tropes and put a spin on it.But for people who just want a modern solid slasher film, this is probably not it, as the threat isn't per se threatening. As it approaches the horror elements with an 'elevated' approach, this also applies to how the Killer's identity is constructed.Does an 'elevated slasher' film work? It does feel like opposite spectrums of the horror genre. So... it still feels off kilter, but I still enjoyed the attempt at it.""X"" is something fresh in the current landscape of horror flicks, but not necessarily executed smoothly.Warning, if you're reading past this point, it's all spoilers.What stuck out to me was the 'final girl' trope used as the throughline for the film. Who will survive the night and escape? But obviously there are no pure goody two-shoes, even with the title of the film it puts that fact front and center.The kill order was satisfyingly on point, removing the promiscuous shameless characters, the overtly strong and reliable characters, and leaving only the innocent tenacious characters.Lorraine (Jenna Ortega), playing the innocent tenacious character, was a likely candidate for a 'final girl', but the film has long established Maxine (Mia Goth) being the main protagonist even before the killings started happening. Maxine being killer's obsession but clearly isn't innocent, with her drive to become a famous adult film star.In the final moments, it gives the audience hope with two survivors. With the scene slowly falling into place like a puzzle piece matching up with the movie opening scene. The audience sees Lorraine and Maxine about to escape, one last hopeful moment only to have it stolen from them.So, what's the trump card that Maxine holds over Lorraine's character? Aside from the film's pacing not giving Lorraine enough plausible screentime to become a survivor... The final reveal was that Maxine is the preacher's daughter. Previous scenes start to fall into place, Maxine's disgust for religious types, her rebellious nature to conform, and her determination to become famous.Maxine's wonderment of grandma Pearl, which is also played by Mia Goth, reflects a life that Maxine might have had if she hadn't broken free of her father's grasp. A life that is not lived, Pearl trapped with a faithful husband who can no longer satisfy her.What bothered me the most was Pearl's prosthetics. It was throwing me off for most of the film. It was clear that it was a young actress dressed up as an old person. I honestly wouldn't have recognized that it was Mia Goth underneath all the prosthetics just by looks alone. Instead, it was leading me to believe that there would be a plot point dealing with de-aging rituals. But it wasn't, it was just a very pent up lustful grandma wishing to be adored once more.In this film, the whole drive for Pearl and her obsession with Maxine didn't really do it for me, it seemed like Pearl's character role was just a supporting role to mirror Maxine. Pearl's unfilled lust drove her into a serial killer, which felt creepy at best when she was lurking about. Was she always a serial killer even in her youth as a lonely dancer? Like a siren calling in their victims? (The subsequent prequel film ""Pearl"" answers some of this.)It also seems far fetched that a frail elderly couple is able to swiftly and consistently catch their victims for so long. The film doesn't exhibit scenes of the couple being conniving or cunning enough, but only happens to catch the right people at the right time like most slashers. It also isn't trying to be comical or dry humor about it either, even though some of the scenes are ridiculous on par with some other slashers. It's only slightly more ridiculous because the killers are a slow moving elderly couple.",2022-07-23
"You might be thinking, ""but you gave it a 6"". Yes, and that's because that's what it is. It's not Shawshank Redemption. It's not Pulp Fiction. It's a good horror film. A lot of complaints about it being ""pornography"". It's called ""X""...what do you expect. The gore and horror in this film are exceptional. Some great kill scenes and great acting from Mia Goth. If you enjoy horror films that don't make you think, with good acting and gore, this is for you.",2022-05-02
"A24 films are all beautifully shot and well acted. This movie does the same. This film is a huge nod to the 1970s slasher film, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and 1960's thriller, Hitchcock's Psycho. Now combine those two classic films with a 1970s porno and you get this movie.Sex is a major theme in this film. And I do not put that lightly! Personally, I did not care for this movie but that's just my personal opinion. It had one too many sex scenes and is highly critical of ""prudeness"" and challenges sexual monogamy. But it's an A24 film, all movies that belong to this production company challenge traditional norms! NO SURPRISE AT ALL!A24 fanatics will probably love this. Others will like it because of the nostalgia and the unique take on the classic horror genre but others will be turned off, no pun intended.I feel really gross after watching this movie. Maybe that was the intent of the filmmaker so this movies does accomplish that. Definitely not a good date movie.",2022-10-07

"The characters are all so honest and genuine, and with the slow build during the first half, we really get to know them. It makes you actually care about it when they die.The idea of aging and being seen as ugly and disgusting is something that most people go through. I felt real sympathy for this old couple who just want to be young again.The kills, while few in number, make up for it with intensely gruesome visuals.Don't be fooled by all the 1 and 2 star ratings. While not a masterpiece by any means, X does the slasher genre a big service as an emotionally challenging experience, as well as having the obligatory T&A and squirm-worthy violence we all expect from a sleazy slasher.",2023-01-22
"Some movie are so bad it's laughable and you still have a good time. This movie isn't, it's just boring. It takes SOOOOO MUCH TIME before anything happens and when it does, you guessed it : it's lame. All that happens is so predictable (Let's just go into this dark basement that can be locked, or not seeing the person's hand and oh surprise, a knife! Etc) and also makes no sense. How can a 90 years old that can barely move find the strength to start stabbing people? Also I don't understand the need to spend 10 hours on prosthetics to make someone look old (with a not so believable effect) when you can just cast an actual elderly person. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 cause some actors were good, but I still wouldn't suggest wasting time watching this movie.",2022-12-31
"X is about a group of young filmmakers who set out to make a porn film. Each member has their own motivations for doing it; the blonde chick wants to become a star, the brunette wants to live a better life, the black guy wants to lay some mad pipe, the older white dude is the producer trying to keep everything moving, the cameraman has hopes of creating a porno with class, and his religious girlfriend (and sound operator) is dragged along. They end up shooting in an old couples guest house, and these people are pretty strange.This film was enjoyable the whole way through. There wasn't only a lot of suspense, but it was also really funny. The characters were all funny and unique, and there was a ton of blood, gore, and sex, and if you enjoy watching that stuff, this film is for you. 8/10.",2022-04-10

"A film crew wants to shoot a porn movie. To do this, they rent a cottage of an old couple. This was not a good decision, because it develops into a horror slasher story. The film is a slow burn. It takes 50 minutes to get to the first death, but we get to know the characters better. The acting is consistently good. Maxine, played by Mia Goth, turns out to be the main character. But also Jenna Ortega as Lorraine should be known to everyone after the huge success of Wednesday. The film deals with many themes. It is about lust of young and old and love, but also about religion. The film was inspired by other works like Psycho, which even gets a mention. Lorraine was first a shy person with a cross around her neck, in charge of audio, and evolves into a person who wants to be in the porn movie herself. To do this, the plot of the film must be changed in the middle. Similar to Psycho or X itself, which is first a porno and then becomes a horror film. The combination of these two genres is well done. There is a scene where they keep cutting back and forth between the porn movie and a real scene. In the process, the format also always changes and there are parallels of the plot of both scenes. The motive of the murderer is also based in lust. Thus, both genres, as well as porn film and reality slowly blur. In the first half, an uneasiness is triggered in the viewer. The old female owner of the estate is always portrayed mysteriously. You don't understand what she thinks or wants for a long time. This is also underlined by a great soundtrack. This, like the movie, combines sexy moans with creepy noises, creating a sound picture similar to the video game Little Nightmares. The film never gets really scary and the slasher aspect isn't particularly fun either. The film is carried by the mood, the mystery and the characters. Artistically, the film makes quite a bit.Thanks for reading.",2023-01-07
"X is a 2022 film where the potential stayed so strong but lost so much of it afterwards. X was fine, it has good characters and other good things. It had a solid performances, it was genuinely a good time. Needless to say, The horror they put in to this film was wasted potential. It's gory elements trying to gross the viewers but there is no actual horror that can terrify people. It's just shocking and disturbing. The Climax of this film was shockingly bad. Not because it was trash but because it felt rushed. Our final character dies and there's less than 10 minutes of the movie so the scared protagonist immediately becomes fierce? In the end, Pearl was better than this film and needless to say, this wasn't trash at all. But it's potential fell drastically.",2023-07-05
"It was not a bad movie, but not a great movie either. Just so so. That's why I gave it a middle of the road rating.It kept my attention. But I'm honestly not sure why it did. I think it kept my attention because it was super predictable and I wanted to see if my predictions were correct. Which they were!I liked the period piece aspect of it. But it wasn't a very original storyline.The acting wasn't anything special. Very mediocre. The old lady was horrible acting. And the old couple were very creepy and not in a good horror movie way. In a very, I felt uncomfortable watching them way. Such bad acting. You could easily tell it was younger people trying to play a very old person. At least in the old woman's case.Honestly this is a skip for me. My husband liked it. But I really wouldn't recommend it.",2022-12-29

Then the horror slasher movie started.Way too much bloat, a good edit with 30mins shaved off would turn this into a far more enjoyable and watchable movie. I'm not talking of shaving huge amounts of the start either, the horror bits had way too many long takes.",2022-07-06
"Maybe my mistake was waiting a good horror film, and I don't say that is a bad idea at the beginning but maybe is the typical case of the director who prefers to show sex than history, plot or coherence
I think that the general concept was good but at the end (i feel is a directors, men directors, have a trust issue) and they prefer or decide that all the scenes have people naked and porno with small boobs
I feel uncomfortable because if I want to watch a porn movie I can search it in a porn page BUT I WAS EXPECTING BLOOD AND SCARES, so if you want to watch porn better search another option and if you can't to watch a scary movie REALLY SEARCH ANOTHER OPTION, don't waste your time with this movie.",2023-01-30

"Alright, ill just start it off by saying how amazing the 2 antagonists of this movie were written. Usually, when you see a gory scary movie, the villain is just a killer because he´s crazy and our main characters need to be killed. That's not the case here. The elderly couple were giving heart sympathy and made me feel kind of bad for them. Yeah, the music indicated that something was up, but for the first 2 acts of the movie, they just seemed like an old and lovely couple. Which made the first killing scene come as much more of a shock, and made me jump in my seat. And for some reason, I couldn't help but feel bad for her even as she was stabbing the guy in the throat. That's some great writing.Ty West nailed the old 70-80s era slasher films. It kinda gave me Friday the 13th vibes. Amazing cast with great build-up. There was a big emphasis on introducing everyone, so we start to care about them before they all get brutally murdered. I loved the soundtrack and the whole atmosphere he had created. It was definitely the best it could be considering the story 7/10.",2022-04-07
"Unfamiliar with Ti West's catalogue outside of his direct-to-video Cabin Fever sequel (which was stupid, gross-out fun), I didn't quite know what to expect from this. The positive word-of-mouth and the trailer for it's upcoming prequel, Pearl, convinced me to check this one out. X has a lot to say about ageism, sexism, gender roles, jealousy and puritanism, and while the film certainly isn't subtle about any of this, the film is effective enough to bring those points home. There's an appropriate sleaze that pervades this movie. It plays with our expectations, paying reverent homage to the grimy slasher films of the 70s, while also subverting the character tropes from those very same movies. The ensemble here is likable, it's a joy to hang out with them, and Mia Goth has a particular screen presence that completely drew me in. Beyond the lack of subtlety, the old-age makeup effects were completely distracting, unfortunately falling into the Prometheus/Bad Grandpa camp of prosthetics, and the movie does just kind of fall into standard slasher fare towards the end. Still, Ti West directs and edits this flick with style to spare and his adoration for the genre bleeds off the screen. X is kind of like Boogie Nights meets Texas Chainsaw and it's a pretty effective little shocker. I'm looking forward to Pearl this September.",2022-07-27
"X or the revival of chainsaw massacre, produced by the famous studio A24, announced a sulphurous horror film and that will be little be re-inventing codes that truly changed the horror cinema of the 80s. It is ultimately nothing, on the contrary and on this point it is a little disappointment, nothing will be really surprising despite a really successful atmosphere, with in the background the image of the couple that breaks in front of these women who claim their sexual freedom. But unfortunately the purpose of the film, remains very surface, clean to what offers a beautiful plastic that still holds breath.The characters suffer from a real lack of development to truly stand out. Of all this there remains however a very pleasant moment insofar as we appreciate the film for what it is: A better teen film than usual. It's really a shame that the film misses its subject a little because of lack of audacity which is quite ironic in the end when we remember its title. In itself it remains all the same, a real, good little horror movie of Saturday night.",2023-11-01

Slow movie. It's standard film entertainment like any other movie until roughly the last 30-45 minutes. That's when it starts to get into the horror but even then it's weird. Not the best horror film but not bad either.,2022-06-26
"The whole concept is ""old people can't have sex,"" old people= scary, bad. This isn't even remotely true, to add on that old people are so bitter they'll kill everyone is ageist and the way they went about it felt very unrealistic. There are many ways to work around disability and sex, and it didn't quite make sense why they wouldn't explore that before massacring young folks. This tired concept that has been pretty prevalent in horror films, the idea that elders are somehow very dangerous and manipulative is tiresome especially when that's the whole concept. You can have old characters who are creepy but give it more of a concept, and background. Not to mention, elders are the most at risk to get hurt and this adds to the stigma. I enjoyed the first half of the movie, I liked seeing the drama unfold with the stars and their views and aspirations seemed interesting. Once the gore and horror started, it felt lazy and like they had no real direction to killing the characters. I understood the concept of the last one being special and the daughter of the priest... Nonetheless, lazy. Great acting on everyone's part, bad concept and execution. It should of just been in a drama.Sincerely, a twenty something year old horror fan.",2022-05-29
"Whilst being a pastiche of the 70s era of cinema, focusing heavily on the pornographic adult XXX and exploitation horror sub-genres, it never quite reaches the shock levels of the material it is emulating. A lot has happened in the over fifty years of cinema since the time period of the movie's setting, so seeing two of the movie's female stars (Brittany Snow and Mia Goth) simulate sex scenes is nothing we haven't seen one hundred times over. The gore too, whilst at moments deliciously wet and crunchy, is very sparse for a film that labels itself as a blood soaked shock feature. There is only really one remarkable instance of it in fact during a horrific yet strangely inspired scene where a character's neck isn't just slashed but transformed into a soaking wet scarlet cavern.With that being said it's very enjoyable in it's self referential nature, at times reminding me of the first two installments of Wes Craven's Scream franchise. References to the wankery of claiming to be making high art out of 'smut', as Jenna Ortega's character calls it, land very well including one scene where the director character (RJ played by Owen Campbell) claims to want to copy the avant-garde by throwing in pointless pretentious transitions and edits to which director Ti West obliges by editing the movie in the same way. The actors are clearly having fun, especially Brittany Snow and Martin Henderson who deliver lines in the most fantastic southern drawl.It works best when considered a horror comedy, much like the Scream features I mentioned previously, because for a film intended to shock nothing much happens for the first hour of its runtime. The only scene of tension in this time being an expertly shot near encounter with a alligator for Mia Goth's Maxine. The cinematographic work in this scene is really fantastic and doubles the heart-rate as it jumps between the duel threats of the gator as well as the creeping old lady in the bushes, Pearl, whose intentions are foreign to us at this time. Then cutting to a god's eye view shot of an unknowing Maxine as she floats adrift and nude; completely vulnerable between the horrors and completely unaware of her tenuous situation. It's a masterfully handled set-piece and unfortunately is the standout amidst the movie's other tense scenes of threat which range from good (a visit from Pearl whilst Maxine is asleep) to pretty standard (a death in the barn).West deploys an artificially produced film grain filter that he has thrown over the visuals which almost seem meaningless as they are so minute. This movie very much feels like it was shot digitally. West's 2009 feature, The House of the Devil, went all out on this adherence to an authentic visual style to the period it's emulating and I don't quite understand why he didn't go for a repeat of it here as, if anything, the flourish would have more of an impact on this picture instead.",2023-03-17
"I hope Pearl is better. Not a bad movie. Just not a good movie. Not scary. No real tension. Every death scene is predictable. Jenna Ortega is a highlight. Plays her part well enough. The plot isn't confusing, it's just not very good. No build up. Anyway, I guess I just don't see the point of this movie. I've seen a number of films by Ti West. House of the Devil was at least interesting. Sacrament too, I guess. The cast of this movie seems so much better than anything he has written. And it still fails. Is it him? I don't think the acting is failing. I hope Jenna Ortega survives. That's likely the only reason I'm still watching this. I hope Pearl is better.",2023-02-17
"All new horror movies lack the depth, this movie though, touch up on intriguing idea of age, the cinematics and the way this movie was shot is fascinating, it's gory, bloody, and interesting.This movie is well put together, keep in mind that the movie is very slow to begin but I never felt bored during watching.I recommend to watch this movie with your partner.",2022-08-16
The producer said Maxine and Pearl are not relate by blood? So how come they are look alike? Plus how does pearl feel when she seen that Maxine has exactly same face when Pearl was young? How could you feel like want to molest someone who has your face? It doesn't make any sense at all. And how possible someone of the age nearly 100 years old could ever have power to slap young woman so hard and even pushed a young woman into a crocodile pond? This movie is not a fantasy right? But it is the most unrealistic movie I have watched ever. If you just want to enjoy some nonsense unrealistic story then you probably enjoy it.,2023-05-17
"The acting in the film overall was OK. I dont blame this on the actors, but man the story/suspense/horror/entertainmen/etc was just absolute booty cheeks. One of the worst horror/suspense movies I have ever seen. A lot of parts were extremely dragged out and predictable and lackluster to say the least. Movie also took way too long to get started, the beginning of the film felt like it was written by a horny virgin teenager. Luckily I didnt pay anything for the film so i don't want my money back or anything, but man I wish there was a way to refund time, because I'd want my time back for sure!!",2023-10-14
"Not great as a horror movie but you will definitely get tons of laughs. Lol some of the scenes are so silly and absurd. An elderly couple plays it completely for laughs and also contributes to this bugs bunny style violence. I had never heard of it and went into it expecting horror. Ending up laughing till my sides hurt. Very cartoonish in style. There is very little plot, and some characters are only there to increase the number. Give it a try if you see it on demand or free on cable. I'm really not sure there's anything I have found so far this year that actually is scary but I will take the laughs.",2022-10-26
"While the premise is standard classic movie trope, the execution is much different. Slasher movies are a dime a dozen and this movie falls right in the middle. It's nothing groundbreaking and it relies heavily upon the ""making a porn"" premise way too much.Each character has their own place and they take time to give each of them some sort of defining trait but it's ultimately pointless. Foreshadowing deaths with lazy dialogue might seem clever to some but man it's really grating to anyone who has ever watched a movie before.The movie looks great and the practical effects are always better than any form of cgi. The opening shot is really cool and shows that the cinematographer knows what their doing but so many well framed shots are wasted on bad acting and a confusing plot. I don't need every killer in a movie to have the best motive in the world but I do want something. The creepiness and unsettling nature of the villains isn't enough to keep me interested.I know there is a prequel that might give us a bit more information but that doesn't help this movie. Like, give me more than an old woman who is sex deprived as a reason to kill a bunch of people. She kept saying she needed one of the girls for what seemed like a specific reason but when it came to the end she just shrugged it off. Like, why did she need a young woman to fill her sexual needs? Why was there an abused naked dude in the basement? Was it all just about sex or was there more that I missed?A few of the kills are surprising and full of gore while the others were lazy and boring. There was just an unevenness to the movie that made me feel like it was missing something. Maybe I wanted a character to root for? Horror movies have a unique place in cinema since they are usually places for superb creatively but the chances this movie takes is with giant fake silhouetted penises instead of good storytelling.",2023-10-23
"The movie is about a gaggle of pornographers renting land on a farm to shoot their smut film. One of the land owners, a sexually frustrated gross looking old broad, starts killing the pornographers off one by one. Somehow has sex with a guy after she kills him. The cast wasn't bad. The makeup used for the old lady was pretty rough looking but maybe they didn't want to hire an old lady actress to do some of the stuff she was doing. Otherwise the acting wasn't bad.Lot of weird shib going on in this movie. Idk I feel like I could've beat the brakes off that old lady but it's a horror movie. Old people = scary nowadays.Btw not that much blood comes from a foot if you step on a nail. We've all seen Home Alone.",2023-10-05
X is a good horror movie that I was definitely not ready for. I don't know if it was something I ate or the movie (or maybe a mixture of both) but I was very close to actually throwing up a lot of times.,2022-07-28
"I really had no idea what movie I was going to get when I decided to watch X. I had no idea if it would be Texas Chainsaw, Hills Have Eyes, Wrong Turn, Friday 13th?What I got was a movie that on many technical levels provides you with a very thought out and mechanical structure and feel. It's beautiful, sexy, horrifying and disgusting but at the same time, it felt very mechanical in the sense that the story didn't feel organic to me. It felt overly planned out and structured, where each plot point had to be met precisely but Ti West became so focused on the craft that he forgot to make the characters notable or likable beyond archetype.The most human and believable character in typical fashion with 70s and 80s slasher flicks, was not treated too kindly. I'll leave it up to you to decide who that is.I feel that if this had continued to be a movie about a group of people filming a porno in a weirdos back house, it would actually have left room for some intrigue. Instead we're invited to the slasher time through a predictable (probably purposefully so) starting shot for X that takes off sprinting and keeps sprinting until close to the end where it seems to run out of energyWould I recommend someone to watch X? I think this can be one of those more polarising flicks where on one side, there's a group that understands the genius of the film and on the other side there's myself (hopefully not alone) thinking that it was perhaps sniffing its genius a little too much to forget to come up for air.If you dislike sex scenes, exploitation, nudity, graphic violence and gore and disturbing imagery. I don't even know why you're here. This clearly isn't the movie for you.Otherwise, you can expect to be at least mildly entertained, but beware that the sex scenes are quite vivid, loud and not the short sweet PG13 fade to black. If that's no problem for you, then it's a good movie and on technical levels, it's impressive. While narratively I was left unsatisfied (get it? Cause...nvm) but still entertained enough that I don't regret watching it.",2022-06-07
"This is, by far, the worst thing I've ever witnessed in my life... a stupid story with a plot that's so boring I wanted to gouge my eyes out... horrible horrible acting with cheesy ... Mia Goth with the worst make-up ever to make her look like an old lady, who is beating the hell out of every one... Sex scenes that has no meaning, which shows the degradation of the culture, that people only thinks about sex all the time like it's the only thing old people lose... the reason that made the officer in disbelief in the first scene in the movie isn't that horrible compared to everything else that happened... and the hero of the movie is a girl who is a pornstar and an addict (the culture is going down the drain and the messages sent through movies are disgusting)...I can go on and on with this and talk about each individual scene, but no site will have enough pages or characters... how this movie got a 6.6 rating on this site is beyond me... RIP future generations...I'm giving one star for the gore only!!!",2023-10-30
"I'd heard so many good things about this film and its sequels that I finally gave it a go. I wish I hadn't bothered.There's no smart storytelling at all, the first 50 minutes just seem like an excuse to make the actresses act out the filmmakers ideal porn scenarios and the last half just seems to be about how unappealing women will become when they get old. The ""old woman is gross and creepy"" is becoming a weird trend lately and there is literally no explanation behind her behaviour and murders apart from ""shes a woman, she will of course be annoyed she's old"".Maybe the sequels are better and give more insight but I'm not sure I even want to give them a go after this.",2023-08-23
"I'm not gonna call this one terrible at all, it's a pretty unique horror movie but it just wasn't for me.I didn't like how much of a slow burner it was despite being a slasher film, took a whole hour for the action to start. We get 60 mins of sex and about 30 to 35 mins of horror. Like I get it, it's the premise of the thing but Jesus they drag out those freaking scenes for way too long, if I wanted to see porn I'd just see porn. By the time we get to the horror I didn't even care about it anymore, though I will say I found about 2 of the kills to be pretty unique and well executed.SPOILERS STARTI honestly think that I might have liked it better if RJ ended up snapping and becoming the actual villain and say he's gonna turn the film into his own sick project but instead we end up with ""Old gross people are jealous to a crazy level that they can't have sex"". The villains also seemed to switch between pathetically weak and strong & stealthy on a dime.SPOILERS ENDI think I'd rather re-watch The Skeleton Key (2005) or Malignant (2021) than watch this again.",2022-05-25
"I love slashers, they are my favourite sub genre, but this wasn't it. The acting of the young people was pretty good for the most part but the old couple were way too fake and threw the immersion of the film. People calling it gory I'm sure have never seen a slasher before. The only cool death was the alligator but it looked so fake.",2022-08-16
"Fantastic 70's style horror movie, the contrast bettewen the first and second half of the filme are very noticible, very thriller like first half with obvously the sex parts of the movie, and a much faster second part really giving that slasher style to the film, also i must say this filme is not just another slasher horror movie it has an interesting disturbing side to it that actually makes him a bit unique...Talking about the positive points first, the picture is outstanding from the start to the end of the movie, some shots like the river one, and the final sex scene in the bedroom (dont want to give spoilers) are soo well thought, and very well accomplished.The acting is very good, Mia Goth in specific was amazing, she was really capable of transmiting the energy of the filme to the audience throughout the all movie, and her final scene was satisfying.Soundtrack was very well selected in specific the old rock in the start of the film passed the cool teen vibes we needed to the first half of the movie.One of the things i liked the most was the junction of two very different themes of movies (erotic and horror movies) that are not putted together nowadays and happly are coming back.For thosse who are talking about the lack of blood in the movie and the lack of violence with the girls in the movie im just going to give two examples...
Old lady final of the movie, and the not soo old girl with a big problem in her face, it was very graphic and bloody, also talking abount lack of blood only the ""red truck"" scene was bloody as hell soo idk how people are coming up with these ""problems"".There were more good points but im alredy expanding this alot soo bad points now....Some of the kill scenes are not very good, and not very creative, some of them are also soo predictable, in particular the river one...
Also the shotgun one in the hoods just makes me sad that we dont see the ""result"", i think that's were some of the ""lack of blood coments"" are coming from, second shotgun kill just feels like a desesperation of the script to kill someone, character thrown away, and another mediocre death.The old couple just look a bit like zombies unfortunatly, i see the idea but the make-up too exagerated...The backstory to that place was also not explored the old couple even in the final of the movie we know almost nothing about what they have done in the past, i understand the decision on the lack of info but i just think it was a bit too fast the second part of the movie and they had the time to explore better the old house and some of the characters....
The worst part was that they had the perfect character locked inside the old house and they didnt explored that oportunity...Just to finish, the final police scene was fantastic, amazing quote to finish the film.And also this slasher type movie as not been very popular nowadays but with films like these i think they will start to ascend again, we hope at least...",2022-09-26
"Was a good movie don't get me wrong..great shots and camera work . But story line could have been better with the Givin material..I felt like I was watching a raunchy version of ""the visitors"" with how it was with the old ppl..just seemed like so much more could have been done and we ended up with something I've seen before ..",2022-06-02
Anyone else think the movie was too dark to see anything???? It was so frustrating! I kept readjusting my settings to try and see better but nothing! Gave me a headache! The movie itself was very promising in the beginning but there was no connection to any character. In that case I usually root for the antagonist but even they were hard to see and hear so it was a bust! Huge waste.,2022-08-21
"This is a boring and weird (not in a good way) film. The first hour is just people having sx and people generally annoying characters so you won't care about them and not much else, then it gets weird with an old woman wanting to touch everyone up and get her husband to sleep with her, then randomly kills them. It's not creepy it's just kinda gross but not in a horror movie gross kinda way, just a ""man, I don't wanna see that"" kinda way. The horror itself of the killing is ok but by then I doubt you'll care. Waste of hour and a half. This is not a good movie and find it odd it's so highly rated on prime and here.",2023-01-03
"This is what I've anticipated, in a good way! The whole movie has that horror-suspense vibe I've wished to see. Maybe some don't like the story and the plot. But the small things make the entire movie so good.The actor, actress, story, scripts, visual story, everything was good.",2022-04-20
I think the movie was cute and the cast did a great job i just wish the story was told a little better with more at stake maybe or more of a twist but also i don't think they were trying to make it a movie with any crazy twists i think they were just making an ode to 70s/80s horror so all in all i thought it was a cute movie!,2022-04-05
I like the retro look of this movie.Scene with swim and alligator excelent.Simply bizzare but worth watching.I like disturbing climate and the 80/s in the horror movies.,2022-05-21
"Gotta believe if this were shot similarly to your average horror movie these days, (think Texas Chainsaw) it would not be receiving this high of praise. While the look and production of it is outstanding, the story is nothing you haven't seen before. Don't wait for a big twist or enlightening moment toward to end, because it's not coming.",2022-04-17
The movie is a slasher film set in the 70s where some young people rent a building on an elderly couples' property to make porn movies. The elderly couple end up killing most of them and get closer as a couple in the process until death does them apart.It is an undeniably unique movie going places where other slasher movies have not. So if you want something different in horror this is definitely it.By contrast if you are looking for an excuse to see pornography this is not the movie. The sex is suggested rather than shown with close ups of moving parts. It may well be that no actor had sex during the filming.If you don't think you'd like elderly people portrayed in a creepy way or don't want to watch something with clear racist stereotypes implied and risk feeling that you watched a movie where some misogynistic incel type wrote the script then this is not for you.,2022-04-10
"It was ok. A typical of a B grade slasher film. Possible a scenario like hat could have happened....except. Can you name one black county sheriff in Texas in 1978? I doubt that. Anyhow, valiant effort to make a B grade trash film that'll only get watched because the title is ""X"". Movies have really gone to crap the past 10 years, and I sincerely believe it's due to Hollywood's obsession with wild politics. Oh well.",2022-04-17
"The original Texas Chain Saw Massacre directed by Texas native Tobe Hooper is a classic of the genre not only for establishing a brand of grunge horror but for the realism with which it treats its victims. They feel like your friends, or since it was from my parents' time, like my own parents and their friends when they were young taking road trips across the Lone Star State. Furthermore, it feels like a horror brewed from the love/hate relationship city-born Texans have with the heat and with the more ""country"" aspects of life here.A few minutes into Ti West's X, I was pleased to see a few shots paying homage to Texas Chain Saw, but was quickly dismayed to notice no one involved in this movie had apparently been to Texas. Every line in the first 30 min is a forced attempt to sound regional, and it comes off cartoonish, caricaturish, and inauthentic. Martin Henderson's Wayne is a composite of a few Matthew McConaughey characters and Britney Snow's Bobby-Lynne is a discount Dolly. They can't decide what era or which part of the South they're from or whether they're from the city or the country. I wonder if non-Southern viewers really think that young people in 1979 Houston ever unironically spoke like they were in an old Western film. Certainly they would not dream of filming a porno in a barn outside of cool winter months.The slow first hour of this movie is a long set-up where nothing plotworthy happens except to explore the characters and setting, but it only served to shatter my immersion. I am not easily offended by Texas stereotypes, but in the case of this film, I was not convinced of them. If they were going to shoot in NZ, why not just make it a Kiwi horror instead of a botched Texas Chain Saw tribute? I have to give props to Mia Goth as Maxine for attempting a three-dimensional character. The cinematography was quite good as well, except for the superfluous porn scenes (was this supposed to be shocking? In 2022?). There was also an attempt to make the death of each character pertinent to their revealed flaws, but by that time, X had spent so much time being cutesy it forgot to make me care. OK horror, 4/10.",2023-06-10
"I loved it! Scary, Intriguing, Exciting, and Different! What a movie. It was totally unexpected. Oh! Did I mention it was gross. All the qualities of a 1980's horror show with a little twist.",2022-08-22
"TLDR: Just that, a good movie, fun to watch with friends, and that ending is just the coolest.The movie's pacing is well done. The suspenseful scenes are well-executed, and the action sequences are intense and thrilling. The film does a good job of keeping the audience on the edge of their seat.One criticism of the movie is that some of the characters can be one-dimensional, and the movie relies on simple horror movie tropes. However, this is also part of the film's charm, as it is a horror movie that is self-aware and embraces its own genre.Overall, is a classic horror movie that combines elements of horror and some humor in a unique and entertaining way. The film's self-awareness and strong performances make it a must-watch for horror movie fans, an influential and important film in the horror genre in 2022.",2023-04-06
"Watching X felt like watching the best B movie doable. Everything is a sound choice from actors cast, displaying a very large range of personalities and emotions, to sets, the houses and lake set up makes for great situations between the two characters groups, and the very tight movie direction provides a very interesting watching experience.I believe X to be one of, if not the best, meta-film available by the time of this review. Meta-films are for me a new kind of genre, where the classical movie genre, be it thriller or horror, is set aside a deeper political message. To cite a few of these recent Meta-films : Matrix 4, Clean, Willy's Night, Everything is everywhere... If many of these movies fail to convince due to their assumed parodic tone, X finds strong roots in the horror genre, maybe closer to the political situation it wants to highlight, and thus a better fit.In X, which shall be read ""cross"", rather than ""X"", there is a tremendous number of cross-references. First, at a cinematographic level, through genres, mixing meta-movie (a movie about making a movie), teenage movie and X-rated movie (both horror and adults), second, within the story itself, introducing black and white, shy and seasoned, young and old, female and male characters.""Bitch""
What X wants to highlight is, I believe, the idea of a passage, the transmission, of an aesthetic message through time, represented in the movie, through the various sexual intercourses. What seems naive at first, semen being manually swiped off of a belly, takes a more profound sense as the aesthetic of hands and blood is being later developed.In a way, the message is that the natural cycle of life is somehow broken. As depicted in the ending, even if we manage to free ourselves physically, we always find back in our habits some sort of psychological jail.X, 10/10.",2022-05-29

"I never saw a Scary Movie like this before. I am a really fan of this kind of movie. I think this kind is not for everyone, but the Scenes were really intense. There wer not so many jump scares, but the atmosphere was really scary and the music in the background underlines it. This Movie have many diffrences to other scary movies and for people who likes horror movies this one is a good choice. The making off the movie and effects were really simple not many special effects, but much blood. One thing i needs to criticises, there was not a long story about the creepy villain. So you didn't knew why some things happens, but all in all I have to say that this movie is a good choice to watch and I rate this movie a seven out of ten.",2023-10-05
I'd like to offer a less pretentious review. The movie was ok. It was enjoyable but a little on the odd side as most A24 movies are. If you like sex and gore in your horror films you should enjoy this movie.,2022-05-21
"It could have transcended as a horror movie that showed it all, Gore and Explicitness, however, the movie is too shy when it comes to the sexual nature they are trying to suggest with the title and the R rated film, Mia Goth was part of the Nymphomaniac volumes, which are an example of how to go the extra mile without being a XXX movie.",2022-05-27
"X is A24's newest horror movie that has been getting rave reviews.Bloodthirsty and pornographic, X is slow to develop, making us get closer to the characters. During 1 hour of film practically nothing happens, the final minutes are pure carnage.",2022-08-17
"Despite good acting and stunning visuals, the film cannot defend itself even as a typical slasher. There is no place for horror in it, no place even for sexual tension. It's exceptionally repulsive. It presents sexual desires, appearance, and behavior of elderly people as something utterly depraved, vile, and leading to crime and perversions. This causes film X to be not only very weak, but also socially harmful.Mocking the elderly and stripping them of their dignity is a malevolence equivalent to racism. It's neither funny nor instructive.I'm surprised A24 could be involved in something so disgraceful.Two stars just for Mia's acting skills.",2023-08-24
"I really loved the plot, but they could work a little bit more with all the characters past, instead of putting so many jump scares. For example: being a black marine could save his life for a bit more. And I think it would be better if more than one character survived, because they were 6 against two old guys who could barely move. The amazing thing is that almost 99% of the movie is like a ""real thing"". The old lady is just a psycho and the old man is really in love with her. And the traps/murders were pretty real, it would be something that normal people wouldn't think about (and couldn't escape). But the marine, I can't believe he died so easily.",2023-06-12
"I believe x accomplished all it set out to be, a vintage seeming slasher flick with suggestive themes. I appreciate modern horror that doesn't rely on jump scares and i believe x was executed in the best way possible with that restraint. I may not have been terrified but i was hooked and couldnt get enough the antique shots. This nascent stage of horror makes me hopeful for the future. Solid movie.The casting couldnt have been done more perfectly. With such a stacked cast i never felt bored or fatigued in any way when watching via fantastic acting. Loved the stretched use of mia goth, incredibly versatile actress.",2023-10-18
"If the appeal is homage, it's certainly a must watch. The aesthetic is spot on; from the crunchy, sun-kissed cinematography to the costumes/look of the ensemble cast. The thing succeeds as a period piece, in great part due to the cast who really deliver, most notably Mescudi and Ortega.The modernized aspects work as well within the 70's world the film creates. The cutting doesn't take long to win you over (those transitions are awesome). The music is fantastic, that blending of diagetic sounds with sparse instrumentation really adds to the atmosphere.Unfortunately, the films strongest aspects are bound to its weakest. The killers have some incredibly touching moments, glimpses of really unsettling empathy come out of some of the most disturbing moments of the movie resulting in some really unique emotions. These moments, however, are followed by bland gross-out punches culminating in a deeply uninteresting motivation for the violence at hand. If you've ever helped a grandparent get dressed, some of the thrills don't hit nearly as hard as the filmmakers clearly want them to.Also, a personal qualm: those bookends. I loved the detail with the TV Speaker and its implications to Maxine's furious urge for fame. But that cops last line? No thanks.",2022-11-25
"This has turned into one of my top 10 horror movie favorites! It has a story...which is what is lacking in so many horror movies today, in my humble opinion. It is a bit gory in places, but I can look away if it bothers me...! The cast is awesome too, they all do an excellent job, such talent! I also appreciate the subtle humor and the music! The horror world needs more of this,again,in my humble opinion. This movie has restored my hope into some good movie entertainment! There's so much bad to mediocre out there and this is definitely a bright spot! I can't wait to watch Pearl! Congrats to you!",2023-01-08
"X has it all. Whether it be the blood and gore, witty humor, clever writing, captivating performances, or stunning camera work, there is something for everyone to appreciate here. The film manages to hold an artistic direction while not coming off as pretentious as some other A24 productions.The writing is immaculate. Every piece of dialogue in this movie has a purpose, as there are many specific lines from the characters that lead to a great payoff down the line, giving X that rewatchability factor.The antagonists of the film are much more unique and multilayered than those of many other slasher movie villains. You may even find yourself feeling for the killers at times.All in all, this was a very entertaining watch, and is a certified horror classic in books.",2023-01-16
This was my first experience with Ti West and it didn't disappoint. There were moments i felt were almost losing track but it soon picks up right before the end. The cast and crew did amazing with emulating the look of Texas '79 and the surrounding areas of it. I look forward to the prequel and how much crazier it can get.,2022-05-04
"This movie starts off solid and interesting. I went in knowing nothing so it was a fun ride to see what the movie is about. But as it went on I started to realize how mediocre it is, which was still mildly enjoyable for a while.I think what put the nail in the negative review coffin are a few parts that I believe are supposed to be the pinnacle of scariness the movie has to offer. Some people will find it terrifying. I thought it was so stupid.And just to be clear, I don't go into a movie with a negative mindset, ready to make fun of everything. I try my best to get into it, to allow myself to be scared. But I couldn't help it. I found it zero scary and all I could think is, ""stupid.""After introducing different elements that make you wonder how it will all come together, it barely does. It's related but not vital or impactful. A few things at the end made me say, ""wth."" And when the credits rolled, my eyes rolled. (1 viewing, UltraScreen 9/14/2022)",2022-09-15
"Wow... it started out extremely good. All the way until we saw the barbarian and then it is just down hills from there. Like most of these indy horror films, someone has some good premise of an idea and then ultimately fizzles b/c they don't have enough material for a full movie or they simply ran out of ideas how to develop it.It has so much potential, the first 40 mins was literally flawless... it was intriguing, mysterious, the actors were really great... and it makes you question and ponder who is the real bad guy and what is going on, then... boom... turned into just another hide and seek, slasher, monster, cliche.2/10.",2023-02-02
"The first act is pretty good. Atmospheric, nuanced, interesting, decent acting - especially from Skarsgard. I did have to really suspend my disbelief a lot to allow the film to move forward though. Double booked AirBnB, no hotel rooms available, the main charcater had done no research on the area before arriving. Really?The second act started well and was enhanced because of the events of the first. It works because it sets the audience up in a position where we have more knowledge than the newly introduced characters. It added tension and I was interested in what direction they would take the story.I liked the way the first two acts played with the personalities / backgrounds of the male leads. Hinting and leaning into social stereotypes but leaving a few clues to the real intentions. It works quite well. I may be crediting the writers too much here, but I think I get the underlying message of this film, but it just gets lost by the end.The longer the film goes on (and it does feel a bit overlong), the more ridiculous it gets. It feels like it's written by two different people; or they spent so much time on the first half of the movie they had to rush the rest. There are some truly stupid moments that are almost farcical comedy. All the tension drained out of the film, and it just became a series of ridiculous scenes strung together. Events are telegraphed way ahead of time. All the nuance is gone.It's so disappointing that something so creepy and initially interesting can go so wrong. Ignoring the stupid decisions made by the main charcater in the first act, I would have scored it a 7. The acting is good, the direction is solid, but the story just drags it down so much that by the end I can only give it a 4.",2022-10-29

"A lot of great things can and should be said about Barbarian. It's a masterfully directed film; Creggor always shows us just enough in each shot that we're left wondering about what's lurking in the empty space on the frame.The first two-thirds of the film are tense when it's quiet and shocking when it's loud. It kept me on my toes for nearly the entire time, which is refreshing for my desensitised eyes.Efficient work is made of the character introductions. Cregor's script doesn't waste time at the beginning of each character's story. We get to know exactly what we need to know about each of them as a person before they get thrust into the metaphorical depths of hell. It makes the eventual carnage all the more nerve-shredding because no character is disposable.So, yes, the film is good. But it's not all good.The film's narrative and pacing are not nearly as compelling and tight, respectively, as they should be due to the fact that it tells the stories of three separate sets of characters (one after the other) before getting to the finale.Also, the film's last act really took a dive into campy and I found it to be a betrayal of the rest of the story's bleak tone.The final set piece is so out-of-left-field and ridiculous that it became unintentionally hilarious for me.This may seem like a minor complaint, but when the ending of the movie leaves a bad taste in my mouth, it kind of sours the whole experience.I wanted this to be better than it was. But it's still so tense throughout its majority and the many twists are so satisfying that I do heartily recommend this subversive horror flick.",2022-09-09
"UGH .... so close - SO CLOSE! But in the end, no cigar. All that potential and solid storytelling dissolving into to a nonsensical, clumsy, rushed, and ultimately unsatisfying conclusion, implementing all of the worst elements of horror movies. That's what disappoints the most. This movie held so much promise and had such a great start and journey all the way up until the end, but sadly the writer(s) somehow couldn't find the way to keep that strong storytelling up to par all the way through to the end. It wasn't that I disliked the end result. It was the clumsy way the screenplay got us there that left a lot to be desired. I was rolling my eyes on multiple occasions during parts of the final act. Video review to come soon.",2022-09-14
"It seems that three different people had unfinished scripts and someone stapled the pages together and decided to make a movie from the result. Unfortunately, the result is ""Barbarian.""What or who is ""Barbarian?"" I have no idea! I didn't know much about the movie, but I saw some positive reviews, so I took a chance. Apparently, the people who really liked this movie are either paid reviewers or have never seen another movie before.I liked Tess and the tension between her and Keith.After Keith meets ""The Mother,"" the movie takes a sharp fall off a tall cliff and lands on jagged rocks below. Any sort of impact the scene had with Keith and ""The Mother"" was immediately destroyed by the next scene. After that, the movie never recovered.It's annoying to see characters in horror films with super-human strength. ""The Mother"" literally ripped a person's arm off and beat him with it. Apparently, she can also leap from tall heights without any problem. You would think that she would be malnourished and frail. Noooooooo!It's also annoying to see bumbling cops that disregard an obvious problem while scoffing at a victim.The fact that the AirBB house looked reasonably decent in a run down, crack house neighborhood is ridiculous. I doubt the house was rented out constantly, so I'm sure squatters would have overtaken the house at some point.IMDB states in its Trivia section, ""Although not officially credited in any way, Jordan Peele was an invisible hand in shaping the eventual story."" If I would have known that, I wouldn't have seen the movie. I dislike the crap movies that Peele is involved with.Save yourself the frustration and skip this sad excuse of a horror movie.",2022-10-25
"Barbarian is a film I've been curious about for a while. When I saw the trailer, it did not seem that interesting to me. However, when it came out and was getting praised by critics, including Youtube personalities I follow, I became quite interested. Plus, the film has some notable actors like Justin Long and Bill Skarsgard, whom I've liked it other things. After finally seeing the film, I have to say I'm disappointed. Now, this might be because of how hyped-up the film is. Maybe, after seeing it more times I'll warm up to it more. That's happened before. However, right now I can say I wasn't a big fan of the film.It's not the worst or the most disappointing movie I've seen this year. Dr. Strange 2 was definitely the film I was disappointed most by. Halloween Ends is the worst film I saw this year. It's definitely the worst horror film I've seen. I can say Barbarian is better than that film. However, there are other horror movies I've seen that are better like the Black Phone and even the new Hellraiser film.Now, the film does have some things going for it.It's a good-looking movie. It has some creative and atmospheric environments and shots. The performances were all good. There are some good kill scenes. There isn't many of them, but when they happen you have some good effects. I also like how the film subverts expectations a little bit. It feels a little like Psycho in that regard. You think it's going to be one movie, but then it becomes something else later.But I just found the film very boring throughout most of it's run. A slow burn like this can work if you're attached to the characters, but I just wasn't. I found the leads pretty boring or unlikable. So those things really brought the film down for me.But I'm in the minority on that. Most people seem to really like this film, and that's fine. Right now, I'm not really one of them. If you want a horror movie that cleverly subverts your expectations, but is more fun (at least to me), watch Malignant by James Wan.",2022-10-20
"I don't always pick up a movie's deeper meaning upon first viewing. Usually for the first watch, I just want to enjoy the plot. That's how it was with Barbarian, a monster movie with more to say hiding below the surface.Barbarian is a story about a woman interviewing for a job in Detroit, and the troubles that arise when she finds that her AirBnB is already occupied. I won't go into more plot details and I recommend you go into this movie knowing as little as possible.It isn't possible, though, to avoid some spoilers in discussing the layers to Barbarian. So, spoilers ahead.Beneath the horror movie lies a conversation about women and men. There are dangers in being a woman, which two of the primary characters briefly discuss. But there are also misperceptions that can lead to disaster. Who is good and who is bad, and how can one tell? Does a woman let bad men change her perception of the entire gender? Does she let it make her into a monster? Can a man change? What is a woman? What is a man? What should they be?I went back and forth several times on whether the character Keith was going to be the movie's villain or not. Well done to the writers and director for that. Upon second watch of the film, I realized that many or maybe even all of the circumstances that put the audience and the character Tess on alert about Keith are situations outside of his control. He didn't mix-up the AirBnB reservations. He didn't open Tess's bedroom door as she slept. He didn't choose to get lost in the cavernous dungeon. But, he might have, and up until the very last second, the audience is left guessing about Keith. How difficult it is to judge someone's character.Then, we switch to Justin Long's character AJ, a magnificent cut scene that left me surprised and delighted upon first viewing. Here's another man that we the audience might have a little trouble getting a solid handle on. The movie beautifully puts AJ in different situations in which we for a moment feel for him, or think that maybe he is innocent of his accused crimes, and then the movie yanks that thought away from us with AJ doing something bad. For example, we have AJ talking to his mom on the phone. How sweet, he's talking with his mom. He seems genuinely certain he didn't do anything wrong with that other actress. Then he hangs up on his mom without even saying goodbye. There goes that idea of him being a good son. Then, later in the movie, he's around the campfire with the unhoused man and Tess and he seems to be having a genuine moment of contrition and making the decision to grow and become better. Then, Mother busts into the scene and AJ runs off as quickly as possible, leaving Tess, whom he accidentally shot earlier, and the homeless man that gave them shelter in the dust.The movie explores the ideas of character and how difficult it is to judge another's character, or even know our own character in an expertly crafted manner. The themes of gender, and trust, and abuse, are wonderfully couched in a genuinely scary and excellent horror movie.Horror is thriving these days, with The Witch, Midsommar, It Follows, Hereditary, Us, Brandon Cronenberg's amazing film Possessor, and many more. Smart, well-crafted films that are both intense, frightening and thoughtful.",2022-10-06
"This was not a good horror film. The story does not make any sense at all - like literally - ZERO. If the lady went out at night, how come she never took the people in the Air BNB on the first night, why did she wait until they found her in the basement? Who opened and closed the door to the basement and locked them - was that just a trap the dad set? How come the black dude never said to her she was going to be attacked he just tried to run at her and scare her? Why would he spend anytime at all in a neighborhood where some creepy old hag lady ran around? Who sold the young couple the air bnb in the first place? How did they get double booked? How could anyone believe that a convention in town would take up ALL the hotel space in Detroit? What was the young man having a nightmare about? What did the people in the basement eat - and when did they eat it - where did the big old bottle come from? How did the guy from Hollywood own property in Detroit? Why did he go back there? How could he not know that the space in the basement was not good for rental or sales? And why was this film even called Barbarian? Was that woman a Barbarian? Nice work from my man Night King, though.",2022-09-13
"Despite an intriguing introduction I was mostly bored for the first hour and annoyed by how basic the actual concept was. The direction is flat, slow and didn't bring any real tension as I have seen way scarier dark tunnel horror scenes.Characters were introduced in a banal way like a tv show pilot with many scenes to give them back story that had nothing to do with the main plot. I guess their main trait is that they all behave very irrationally inside that house.Then the flashback just presented what we sort of guessed all along and in a way that was neither frightening or interesting. After such a long build up I was expecting a proper twist or at least at true horror moment. The ""action"" at the end felt rushed, goofy and again not scary at all.I'm a horror film lover and that's probably the issue as I have seen this exact sort of stories done better. Also this year didn't disappoint with many gems by very accomplished directors like The Black Phone, Pearl, X, Nope (although I'll admit Nope barely fits the horror category). They know how to built fear gradually and create characters integral to the story. While it had a good premise Barbarian felt quite amateurish.",2022-10-25
"This movie has A LOT of positive traits. The plot is interesting and there are some genuinely scary details in it. Unfortunately the plot is also very scattered, some of the choice do not make sense and the further the plot developers, the weirder it all gets.The beginning is actually very good. You don't know what is going on, it's fascinating to find out what is going on. The acting is great, Bill Skarsgård is one of my favorite actor and it was a nice surprise to see him in this. But when Justin Long comes to the picture, the plot loses the intense feeling and the threat. Long's character is way over the top and all the way through his character and intentions do not make sense. They force this #MeToo plot point in the story and it bring the story down quite a bit.There are some genuine scary moments in this, and even though I am a horror addict and seen some scary stuff, this movie manages to frighten me a few times. If they had managed to keep the story more coherent and intact, it would've been a better experience.The last 20 minutes are just bad. I have heard some bad things about American cops but in this movie they do not seem even human and it's weird. The water tower scene is actually bad and Justin Long's character ruins it for good.It's very frustrating to see great potential in something and then see it wasted. First half is a solid 8 and the second half is 5 at best. It's 6,5 average, but I'm lowering in to 6 because of the wasted potential.",2022-12-11
"Ok so Barbarian was bonkers.Given the name, I was afraid it would be a kidnappy gore fest/Hostel style. But I was pleasantly surprised to find it was not even remotely what I thought it would be. It's not what anyone could imagine. I had read it's 90 mins of wtf, but I'd actually almost say it's a slow burn. In a nice way. Really fun to see in a theater, ESPECIALLY if you're from Detroit 🤣 (it def got some choice laughs in the theater I was in) Practical effects, great acting, super stylish directing, laughs, and weirdness. Would be awesome in a drive-in theater, don't watch the trailer, go in blind. It's a riot. Thumbs up from me 👍🏼🚪🔦",2022-09-08
"Barbarian features a warped premise that could have been amazingly terrifying and unique, but which doesn't quite click, despite a decent cast and solid direction from Zach Cregger, who also wrote the film. I think my issue is that the basic set-up offers opportunities to go to some seriously dark and twisted places, but the final product only goes part of the way.Georgina Campbell plays Tess, who books an Airbnb in Detroit so that she can attend a job interview; however, when she arrives in what appears to be very bad neighbourhood, the property is already occupied by a young man, Keith (Bill Skarsgård), who claims that he has also rented the house. With nowhere else to go, Tess accepts Keith's offer for her to stay the night. Tension and uneasiness is established, Keith's behaviour seemingly off.Keith, as it turns out, isn't the danger, for unbeknownst to either of the occupants, hidden behind a secret door in the cellar is a network of rooms and passageways, home to a hideous inbred mutant mother who captures people to keep as her 'babies'.That sounds messed up, and it is, but Cregger's script doesn't fully exploit it's potential. At it's weirdest, disgraced Hollywood actor AJ (Justin Long), owner of the house, is forced to suckle from the mutant mother's breast (Long sure picks 'em!), but I wanted much more from the film: the mother should have been seen putting AJ in a diaper, spooning disgusting food into his mouth, putting him in a cradle etc. AJ is such a slimeball that he deserves to suffer more.I would also have liked to have seen more of the backstory: a flashback shows weirdo Frank (Richard Brake) preparing for the birth of one of his children by shopping for baby goods, but the film glosses over how he abducted women and used them to bear his kids in his underground lair, and how these children grew up to have more children, until the result was the deformed mutant we see in the film. The comparisons to Josef Fritzl are interesting and it would have been good to have seen them explored further.However, when all is said and done, Barbarian is still a fun ride, with plenty of atmosphere, another enjoyable turn from Long, a great 'creature', and a bit of gore, so I doubt horror fans will come away disappointed. I just wanted it to be crazier.6/10.",2022-09-08
"""Barbarian"" is nerve-racking - from the opening seconds, not minutes, but seconds of the film, director Zach Cregger immediately immerses viewers in an experience that leaves knuckles white, nails bitten, and minds consistently wondering what on God's green earth could possibly happen next.Viewing ""Barbarian"" without any knowledge of what it is about is the optimal viewing experience; however, even if you've seen the trailer for this film, you'll be happy to know that it spoils basically zero of the twists and turns this movie has to offer. Thus, I do not want to spoil anything either, which makes this an incredibly hard review to write! So, what I will do is attempt to explain the basic premise of ""Barbarian,"" and what makes it one of the most thrilling theatre experiences I've had in a long time.Starring the beautiful Georgina Campbell as a lone Airbnb renter who is staying overnight at a house in Detroit, Michigan, ""Barbarian"" opens with Georgina's character, Tess, arriving at her rental to find that another man - played by Bill Skarsgård - is already occupying the home. Claiming that this incident is the result of a simple mixup of double booking, Bill's character Keith invites Tess in to stay the night, promising that, in the morning, they will both get this situation sorted out. From that point on, the movie becomes a razor sharp thriller that will infect audiences with its inherent uneasiness.Is Keith truly a stranger caught up in an innocent mistake, or is he someone, or something, more nefarious? And is the rental property all it seems to be, or is there a greater mystery to be uncovered beneath its welcoming surface? ""Barbarian"" begins by introducing question after question to its audience, ensuring that viewers remain on the edge of their seat trying to predict what will next occur. Second after second and minute after minute, this movie is full of surprises, to the point where, after the 45 minute mark, my expectations were blown out of the water to the point where it felt useless trying to guess what would happen next, because I hadn't the slightest idea what could possibly happen next. And that is the highest compliment I can give this movie because, regardless of how you choose to describe this movie, you cannot claim it to be predictable. And on a side note, the fact that the characters actually made intelligent decisions and thought things out only made the viewing experience more tense, because, since everyone was already doing what I assumed a smart person would do, I had no idea how the scenes and sequences would progress. And I also want to pay my compliments to the soundtrack, the direction, and the cinematography, all of which combined perfectly to create a truly chilling experience.I feel like this is a vague and poorly written review, but only because I do not want to spoil anything for anyone. You may have seen the teasers claiming that this film is so scary that people are screaming, vomiting, and passing out in the theatre - while that is just false marketing at its finest, I will say that ""Barbarian"" did induce a physical reaction from me at parts - I could feel my heart practically beating out of my chest during certain sequences due to the suspense. So, while I don't necessarily find this film to be scary, it is one of the most adrenaline pumping experiences I have had in a long, long time. If you are at all a fan of thrillers, I'd recommend seeing this on the biggest screen you can find, and preferably late at night. This isn't the most horrifying movie you'll ever see, but it is sure to get your blood pumping.",2022-09-09
"Greetings again from the darkness. It's a dark, stormy night. If that's not scary enough, Tess is in Detroit. She hops out of her car and dashes to the front door only to find the key is missing from the lockbox. Her Airbnb has been double-booked and a confused and sleepy man answers the door. When Tess agrees to 'come in', we veterans of the horror genre know exactly where this movie is headed. The only problem with our theory is that writer-director Zach Cregger has made it his mission to mess with our heads - and the genre - by confounding us at every turn.Georgina Campbell (""Broadchurch"") plays Tess and Bill Skarsgard (Pennywise in IT, 2017) is Keith, the settled Airbnb tenant. The two actors are superb during their awkward encounter, as Tess comes across as an intelligent and cautious woman, fully aware of the red flags in this situation. Keith is a bit shy, yet polite and accommodating - and also aware of what might make Tess uncomfortable. But Keith looks exactly like the guy who played Pennywise, so Skarsgard's look results in the perfect contrast with this character's demeanor ... keeping us viewers (and Tess) on our toes.It's really the structure of the storytelling that gives this one a creative punch. Cregger serves up 3 different perspectives and then tries to wrap things up in a final act. I actually found all three puzzle pieces well done and interesting, leaving only the wrap-up a bit lacking. In addition to Tess and Keith, we get Justin Long as a cocky actor named AJ cruising along the California coast in his convertible, singing along at full pitch. A phone call abruptly shifts the tone and soon AJ is on a flight leading him to the front porch of a rental property he owns in Detroit. Yep, the same Airbnb Keith and Tess double-booked. Thirdly, there is a flashback to well-kept homes with perfectly manicured lawns. Right again ... the same house a few decades earlier before blight took over the neighborhood. It's in this stage where we note the homeowner (played by Richard Brake) follows a young woman home from the store and gains entrance under false pretenses.If this seems like a lot to tie into one horror film, that's because it is. We'd like to know more about Tess. We welcome AJ's natural sarcasm, and Brake's early years could have been the creepiest of the bunch. Cregger excels at atmospheric tension, especially in the always dreaded dank basement with hidden hallways and secret rooms. He's also clever with his misdirection and inclusion of contemporary issues like immediate ramifications of accusations, and the defensive mode that women must maintain when deciding to accept a cup of tea. I certainly enjoyed the jolting cuts from one storyline to the next. However, I will admit to feeling frustration that Tess was set up as such an intelligent person, only to make multiple decisions that force us to suspend disbelief ... a trait of far too many horror films.Opens in theaters on September 9, 2022.",2022-09-08
"No, they are not mutually exclusive.First of all, props to the creators of this intensely riveting film for keeping us GLUED to the edge of our seats, in suspense, during the slow burn of a beginning, DESPITE thinking we knew what was going to happen.Read that again.In simple terms, even if this film had gone exactly the way we thought it would, the build-up to what we expected to happen, was masterfully handled.Beyond that, the film declines in intensity during the second half, and expects more from the viewer in order to keep its believability factor.I meant to add so much more, but I keep giving away too much and have to go back and delete it. I DETEST spoilers (unless I specifically ask for them) and those who think they actually gain something by revealing anything more than what is necessary. As such and as it is almost impossible to fully discuss the film without some reveals (and I possess tact enough not to spoil it for others), I will simply add that although there ARE a couple of ""dumb"" horror-film trope moments as in 'why did he/she do that' or 'why didn't he/she do that', they are in no way lastingly detrimental to the film. It is quite good, in that it quickly reels you back in and you all but forget about them - at least for the duration.... It is also quite bad in the sense that it is off-the-wall bonkers.It does gift viewers with a couple of funny/humorous moments, but they neither make or break the film.In short, You will really like it, or you will hate it. Either way, see it before someone with less courtesy spoils it for you.(The casting of Alexander Skarsgard was genius).6.5-7/10.",2022-09-16
"What would you do, your Airbnb has two, when you arrive someone is there, a double booking, would you just share? Would you put yourself in danger, with a complete and total stranger, perhaps enjoy a glass of wine, would you really cross that line?This is a film that won't test your full cognition, if you found you were in a similar scenario or situation, not just at the start when the choices might be limited, but later when you find yourself in places quite inhibited.This could have been a spectacular piece of film making but there are far too many tangents, dangling ends and nonesensicals, defying the laws of physics was the least of them.",2022-10-25
I cant believe this movie has such high ratings. I almost walked out due to the stupid decisions made by what seemed rational people. The beginning was slow and oh so stupid. Who stays with a stranger in a seedy area? Who the hell stays in a house after finding a room a serial killer has set up? Then go BACK INTO THE TUNNELS TOO after they left? Who wrote this? I wanted to scream at the actors the whole time! It did get a little fun after we witnessed the Wrong Turn type person. I did laugh due to the dumb choices. I just cant believe people are rating this so high. If you don't mind spending money to watch people make dump decisions then this is for you. Maybe its a new Rocky Horror or something.,2022-09-11
"Yes, I love the tonal switches. That is brilliant. But allowing the characters to keep doing the dumbest thing possible, is distancing. Also, it contains many plot holes. I don't require constant explanations, but...1) Who built the tunnels?2) Who is The Mother. All of those tapes.3) ALL of Detroit was booked for a convention?4) Flashback was 1980 - how many ""generations"" could be fostered, since then? (Granted, the scenario probably started much sooner than 1980.)5) Who was the neighborhood ""watchdog"" guy? WHY would he stay there?6) WHO survives a gunshot wound, and a fall from a likely six-story water tower?The raving Rotten reviews, fascinate me. Yeah, the director grabbed a bit of ""Psycho,"" ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" ""Blair Witch,"" etc. WHY are the critics FAWNING over this?And, yes, it %$#@ bothers me, that I had to Google, while sitting in the theater, to see if there happened to be, an extended after-credit sequence.Once again...the characters kept doing the most idiotic things, to extend the plot.Meh.",2022-09-14
"This is a case of a very well connected guy who gathered his talented actor friends and make something cheap. There is no story here, just a bunch of disjointed ideas that gather to form nothing. Tess (the Halle Berry level beauty Georgina Campbell) is in town for a job interview. There she meets Keith (Bill Skarsgard - no surprise he is also a producer) an awkward dude who is the mysterious renter who is double booked. They share some pleasantries until Tess feels comfortable enough to spend the night. Things go bump. By something unseen. Keith is the massive red herring, having night terrors that make us believe he is a sleepwalking creep. Nope, he is your run of the mill creep in town from New York City (what purpose is he here at all, if not to make us believe he is going to be the terror ahead). Tess goes as far as to take a photo of his driver's license, a device that goes nowhere. Having discovered a secret room that leads to a tunnel, Keith decides to investigate. Though Tess begins by being the smart person of color who understands horror film tropes, she succumbs to...her own stupidity and goes after him. Apparently their night together was so special she felt it necessary to risk her life to pursue him. Hilarious.Cut to, Justin Long's character (don't remember his character name). He is a grotesque Hollywood actor who just got the news he is being smeared across industry papers that he is a rapist. In order for him to gather some cash for his litigation he goes to one of his properties he buys. Guess which one it is? He's so self-involved he overlooks the fact that there was a tunnel through his basement. And he goes deeper and deeper into the mouth of certain death. As a viewer, you scream for him to not be this stupid. Meanwhile, we discover Tess is still alive and being held captive. By what? The most hilariously stupid set-up monster you can invent. An inbred monster from a man who had dwelled in that house since the 1980's. It goes on like this for a while.A few questions comes to mind...
-why in God's name do you yell into the dark maw of a cavernous tunnel as you hear a day old ""friend"" scream in terror. Run, idiot!-What's the story with the rest of the neighborhood. Surely the missing women of the town would've kicked up massive questions. Particularly the town weirdo who buys baby stuff but has no wife
-Was there a reason for Keith at all other than to make us believe he is going to murder Tess?-surely the homeless man knows the secrets but refuses to call the police. For what reason?-Tess has too great of teeth and not manic enough to warrant Detroit police not to take her seriously.-why go back to save Justin Long? He's obnoxious and stupid. Was this only to make her seem better than anyone else?-are critics so fearful of a lead female person of color that they can't ask these questions? Better yet, give it a negative review for clear cut case of massive horror stupidity?-What does Barbarian even mean?So this movie is really a director's vanity piece. Funded by 20th Century Studios, of all things. It most likely was to keep Arnon Milchan and his brood happy. Or to strike out like Jason Blum didThere is also nothing scary about it. It's awkward and squirm inducing. I'm sure had I watched it with an audience most would be screaming at the naive nitwits that seem like that should be smarter. This was movie industry friends putting things together for their own amusement. And seemed making something just to keep busy.Oof.",2022-10-03
"For most I think this is one of those either you love it or you hate it movies. After viewing a couple of days ago I still am having issues deciding on which side of that divide I fall. For me, the opening act was exceptional. Skarsgård was fantastic in his role and Campbell also played her part excellently ( for the entire film really), but the two together had a perfect horror chemistry for me. I really was craving more screen time with both of them.The movie then tries to combine a couple different backstories and attach them all together. I would say this was done with moderate success. The exposure of the character flaws was achieved through these backstories that helped the movie display the themes it set out to, however I felt a lot of time was wasted on irrelevant scenes. I suppose this was an attempt to keep you on your toes, but after knowing how the story ends I would have liked other areas of the story to be explored in a little more detail. Specifically, focusing a little bit more on ""the mothers"" history could have been quite powerful and informing. Instead, the audience is tasked with having to sort of use its imagination to envision exactly how ""the mother"" became what she is.Overall, it was fine, loved some parts and hated others. However, I definitely don't see how this would ever be elevated to the level of a ""classic"".",2022-09-17
"I never trusted Airbnb before, and thanks to this Barbarian, I can justify that feeling.I had high hopes for this movie. So high and instead, all I left was frustrated. How can so many characters make all the wrong choices? Every single decision made had a right way and a wrong way and by the 17th straight bad direction, the movie ultimately became very predictable.An interviewee checks into an Airbnb only to find out it's already rented out by a ""is he really this nice"" of a guy. Her instincts tell her to leave and find another place, so of course she stays in what seems like the nicest place in the absolute worst neighborhood in America. Turns out, looks can be deceiving.Yeah, I was pretty vague on the synopsis. I love to go into movies cold and the first two-thirds of this movie is worth seeing. You probably know what's coming...It's that last third that sank all the potential this movie built up. In fact, it almost made the movie feel incomplete, or that they're already planning the clichéd prequel to expand on so many of the ideas brought up here and barely explored. I was already irritated SO MUCH by all the incredibly bad choices these seemingly normal folk make, but then the movie shifts into supernatural territories that were never established in the first two acts.The villain of the story is just about as strong as Jason Voorhees, but with no explanation that I gathered. At least they call Jason a Zombie from VI onward and that is the time he became three times stronger and more resilient than ever before. The bad-person in this movie not only had the strength of both Jason & Victor Crowley combined, but can also defy the laws of physics. (No spoiler, but involves a miraculous stunt in midair.)Plus, I wasn't a fan of the look of the villain. The villain looked so generic and I've seen that look numerous times before.It wasn't terrible, just frustrating. Especially if you think too logically. Can't recommend, unless you leave your brain at the door.***Final Thoughts: I don't watch trailers or read/watch reviews prior to seeing a movie I want to see. That said, I can tell I'm in the minority. Probably vast minority, but that's cool. Sounds like others have seen something I didn't. Happens to me all the time, as well.And concerning Airbnb: #1 I can't believe they lent their name to this production. It does NOT paint them in a good light. #2 I've never used the service, nor ever plan to. It's just a personal thing: I would both feel uncomfortable in someone else's place unattended but also would fear they would have hidden cameras up everywhere so nothing I do on holiday, supposedly alone or with a loved one, is private. I don't blame them for the cameras since it's their place, but I certainly wouldn't want someone spying on me. It's worth whatever price more to choose a hotel. And besides, #3 you could end up in a movie like this one.",2022-09-18
"First things first:
This movie is well made. Technically. Acting is mostly good, except from Justin Long, but that might be a personal bias as I can't stand that guy. He seems to make every movie a bit worse than it actually is. Also one gore scene is well made and shocking.The first 30-40 minutes are intriguing. Sadly it ends somewhere else.Now to the negatives:
Although it's nicely shot and intriguing first part, the movie disappoints on so many levels after(spoilers now!)Skarsgard gets his head smashed. As soon as the cut to Justin changes the setting and the tone it goes downhill soooo fast.I can't really get my head around why people praise this as surprising, genius, whatever.It's subverting expectations in the worst way possible, by turning an intriguing intro into a silly half comedy half horror nonsense with a message that doesn't get delivered through nice acting and a nice plot but more through the dumbest decisions and most nonsensical behavior by every single character. How anyone thinks the message is delivered well through this is out of my mind.Also the highly praised humor here is what? Justin Long measuring the basement? People really lose their minds about this incredibly annoying scene and praise the sh** out of how funny that was. Seriously?Also Tess being very careful in the beginning and then starting to make the dumbest choices ever seen on screen. Completely out of the formerly established character.And these dumb decisions lack the silly charme of 80ies slashers, on one hand due to the tone and on the other due to what we know about Tess and how clever she is. In the aforementioned slashers, people are dumb tropes from the beginning on, so their decisions fit the role.The whole movie suffers from so many small details that either don't fit the character, that completely change formerly established rules that you need a complete suspension of disbelief to get any enjoyment out of it.",2023-01-19
"I had really low expectations when it started because because it begins exactly the same as ""Weekenders"" did which really wasn't a great movie, different genres though. Over half an hour in I still wasn't sure where exactly the movie was heading, but when things turn dark the thrill starts, old school horror-esque.My only complaint, which unfortunately seemed like it was done deliberately, is that once the horror starts, the movie introduces a completely new character arc and you have to wait for it to build up all again, it purposely teases the eerie stuff which is frustrating because you know the good stuff's coming but not yet. And it does this several times, keeps resetting which makes the second act seem off paced but it all comes together in the end.It was a conventional horror like you'd remember in the 2010's, not really prismatic or director trying to reinvent the wheel; it's just people stuck trying to escape from something in a 'haunted' house. And I like how there was still logical explanation, albeit a disturbing one. A few details that weren't explained, didn't seem to have the time to as it tries to introduce all the characters properly.The last act of the movie is all eerie, it however doesn't climax as hard as I anticipated, thought they'd have more fight but it still did a pretty decent job and the finale scene was sensible end. Almost everything about the movie was better than I expected, I suggest going in blind.",2022-09-10
"Words fail me on how bad this movie was. It's crap actually. I am just not understanding all the love this film is getting... plodding script, wrecked tension, not funny... some decent acting from Georgina and some cool music moments but that was it. This movie was almost as bad as ""Us"" for me. The plot ""twist"" was... just something that had happened in the house? Or was the twist supposed to be it wasn't Skaarsgaard? His unbelievable lines gave that away... I'm also normally a jumpy person and any tension I felt building was destroyed with how they chose to edit and tell the story. It just was not scary at all? I guess this movie wasn't ""made for me"" as someone who doesn't enjoy comedy horror. So disappointing! The first half of the film I really thought the pennywise actor was eventually going to be revealed as the creepy killer but, man I was in for something even bigger and more unexpected. The characters in this movie were really dumb at some points but, hey I guess there supposed to make dumb decisions in order to keep film going flowing with it's momentum. I kept making predictions in this movie only for the movie to keep taking different directions I didn't expect. I can't call this movie a scary movie maybe cause I'm an adult now it just doesn't scare me like older horror movies did when I was a kid but, I'm definitely glad I seen this movie on the big screen. I saw this movie yesterday and I have to admit I do not get the glowing reviews its getting. I guess I'm missing something because I thought it was quite awful. The 1st act was tense but then you get to the big twist and the movie fell off a cliff for me. Would have rather they stuck with the original idea they teased before the twist. There was one particular part in the movie that had something to do with a bottle and I almost walked out. It was painfully bad. Other than maybe 2 jump scares there was nothing that scary about the film. I had high hopes for it so yeah I am a bit perplexed, not at all what I thought. Film was horrible. Not scary and had the dumbest characters ever. What a disappointment this was. This has to be the most overly hyped movie of the year.",2022-10-29
"This movie had good potential the 1st 40 mins were great and scary and stuff and then they do all the bs with a inbred kid. I mean so many plot holes I couldn't even count them first of all. Why is a kid who grew up in a cave with no sun drinking baby milk her whole life, grow to be seven feet tall and as strong as hulk? Second of all how does this old man who starts at like 50 live in a cave with no health care or anything eating spam his whole life live to be like 100? Also if you tell the police you think someone is being murdered they will look into it not just ignore you. Also with the weird guy was he just weird or what? Like he acted like a idiot and was awkward af but no one cared also they had phones basically the whole time, why did no one call 911 or something. Also how did the door keep closing by itself. Like wtf. So for the people giving it tens and stuff good for you like like what you want and stuff, sorry to rain on your parade.",2022-10-15
"My son and I went to see it at the theater and afterward agreed that we probably could have literally seen ANY other movie playing right now, and it would have been better than this mess. I feel so duped -- I'd read the reviews and was hoping it would be a very satisfying horror flick.It's probably one of the stupidest films I've ever seen, with a nothing burger for a plot and all of the characters doing things that are so ridiculous that they don't even qualify as ""horror trope"" dumb. They're just all-time low levels of dumb.Not to mention that there is absolutely ZERO reality to the plot. I don't mind suspending disbelief if the story is good -- but this story is severely lacking AND you basically just have to imagine the whole thing taking place on another planet, as nothing about the central plot line of this movie would or could happen in real life. NOTHING. It's one of the most absurdly unrealistic plots I've ever seen.Don't buy the hype! And definitely don't waste your money seeing it in the theater. If you insist on seeing it after reading the bad reviews, at least wait until it's on streaming so you can save yourself 30-plus bucks, and then all you'll be wasting is your time.",2022-09-24
"I'm glad I'm NOT the only one who knows that this movie was nowhere near good!!!! I watched it thinking that it was going to be good because of the description of the movie as well as the reviews but the reviews have git to be fake because this movie sucked!!!! Why was this movie even called Barbarian to begin with? I didn't see anything in the movie that had to do with the word Barbarian!!! On top of that, it was never explained how the woman(Tess) and the guy(Keith) were both booked at the same place at the same time. They both showed proof of their reservations but nothing was ever said about how the error happened and etc...Then when the other guy comes(A.j.), he specifically asks the question of why were there clothes in the house but the woman tells him that there were no other tenants in weeks. How is that true when Tess's clothes are still in the house???!!!! There were a lot of plot holes in this movie that just didn't make sense.",2022-10-26
"I went in totally blind, with no expectations whatsoever as I only heard of this movie the day I decided to watch it. I think that's the best way to enjoy it.This is campy horror film that has all the classic tropes from horror movies of a home invasion, with some fun twists and turns in it. This is definitely more of campy film though. Not quite as a campy as movies like Child's Play or Leprechan, but definitely not a true horror movie that will give you nightmares like the Ring or the Excorcist.Bill Skarsgård really does a great job setting things up, and Georgina Campbell serves well as the classic ""damsel in the distress."" Justin Long is truly hilarious. This pokes fun at a lot of hororr movie tropes while still being scary enough to have audiences jumping out of their seats. It's a movie that's best seen with a lot of friends in a packed theater. But I don't think it will be a horror classic.",2022-09-10
"Having not seen any trailers, I went into Zach Cregger's ""Barbarian"" knowing only that it was about a woman who books a house, only to discover that a man also booked the house, leading to questions of what happened. It turns out that's only the starting point. This is one movie that really plays with the audience. Even after the most shocking scenes - of which there are many - you still have no idea what's coming.My point is that this is one of the most innovative horror movies in years. Maybe not like ""Psycho"" or ""The Shining"", but this is still one for the ages. Definitely check it out.So yes, Rikki Tikki Tavi, won't you be my baby?",2022-09-14
"When i watched barbarian i felt like i manipulated in all different directions..in a good way, i couldn't guess where the plot was going and it wasn't obvious who was the bad and who the good one... extra credits to the trailer that didn't expose anything... not even the so called 'mama' and in general the movie didn't let you predict anything...The first act was great... the second one it could be better.. i felt like it was two different movies.. the second part was kind of sequel that rarely is better than the authentic first movie. The First movie always has the atmosphere vibes and the jumpscares... and the second one the visuals and the brutal scenes...Well it was just like that. It was good horror stuff.. i can't denny it. Maybe a better balance was needed comparing the first act to the second.. it's kind of weird how they use the same set up for different outcomes.",2022-10-29
"This movie is textbook, to a T, the very definition of a cult film. This is the most ""culty"" film I've seen since rocky horror.I don't really want to say much (or compare this to other films) because anything written will give expectations and this film is absolutely best if you go in blind and with zero expectations. I would really, really recommend avoiding all reviews and any discussion of this film prior to seeing it. If you're a horror fan this movie should be at the top of your list.I will say that the person who made the trailer deserves a major award because the trailer gives away *nothing* at all, which is exactly how a trailer should be and trailers like this are so rare.7/10.",2022-09-12
"Can't believe this film has such a high rating???The main female character has zero judgement, is trusting as a lamb to slaughter.Just before she arrives at the ABNB, she is given hints as to why to not go there, then when she arrives, that should be the end of the film, if she has any common sense. But no, then the writer, takes us on a journey of implausibility.Everything that happens hereon, I was just going, no, that just wouldn't happen, stop the film, do a 'short' if you have to???Terribly unbelievable script.Nasty & boring story.Watch Quarantine or Home Alone, rather than this silly garbage.",2022-12-27
"It was intriguing from the beginning. The whole time I said no, no, no. I usually can figure this stuff out. I never expected this plot. Not really gory, but it's a thriller. Justin Long is great.I understood Tess staying at this house when she arrived at night. I did not understand it when she saw the neighborhood or got the warnings. I would have slept in my car.It was filmed in Bulgaria, but they seem to understand the universal perceptions of Detroit. Whoever wrote the movie did a great job. It's nice to have a plot with some twists. Most stuff out of Hollywood has an agenda. They seem to also remake already great movie. This movie and The Watcher seem to have fresh ideas.",2022-09-10
"In a time where bad to worse movies and shows flood the screens worldwide and numb the heart and souls of the innocent and not so innocent, Barbarian may look a little better than it is actually - acting and production are okayish but the movie misses momentum and the pace is too slow. On top, the level on the horror-o-meter is a rather low one: a mainstream audience may disagree but regarding the true arts of horror Barbarian is a tame entry indeed and the chance for the psychological aspects (of horror) are also not played too strong, so I really wonder after reading some raving reviews what movie those happy guys have watched. Maybe a secret directors cut? Anyway, I won't recommend this one to you, but if you are just in need for some time-killing piece, this one may be good enough for that purpose. Maybe.",2022-10-25
"It's definitely not a 1 or a 10 so anyone who rates it either way is lying but it's somewhere in between. I think it's a bit better than most mainstream horror films (like Smile for example).The first third of the film is good, intense, and introduces the characters but the moment the ""monsters"" in the film are revealed it falls apart.Instead of going down the familiar ""Hills Have Eyes"" and ""The Descent"" angle,I would have focused on the human angle and the Fred character being the monster and seeing more of his backstory.You have to suspend all belief for this film unfortunately. Characters have phones but calls to police aren't made or the 911 operator decides they're ""too busy"". Same with the cops when they do arrive. Apparently, the ""monsters"" have inhuman strength and capabilities. Instead of running, characters keep going back to ridiculous situations.Good attempt but the second and third act in this film should have been redone.",2022-12-23
"Barbarian (2022) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows an Airbnb in the bad part of Detroit that is owned by a movie star. This picture follows two storylines, one involving two people who rent it out on the same night and a parallel storyline where the actor who owns the Airbnb gets into legal troubles and needs to consider selling the Airbnb. When the actor visits the location the storylines are bound to cross...This movie is written and directed by Zach Cregger (Miss March) and stars Georgina Campbell (Krypton), Bill Skarsgård (IT), Richard Brake (31) and Justin Long (Jeepers Creepers).This movie is really, really good. The storyline is brilliantly put together and reminded me of a mix of The Hills Have Eyes and The People Under the Stairs. The details of the history of the house and the various characters is presented perfectly. This is a very smart film and has some Wes Craven elements that jump out. The cast is outstanding and delivers tremendous performances, especially Long. The horror elements are out of this world and this has a little bit of everything going on - intense location, sudden violence, gore, blood splatter and a tremendous villain(s). This definitely needs a prequel.Overall, this is a tremendous addition to the horror genre that is an absolute must see. Initially I score this an 8 while my wife scored it a 9. Since she's way smarter than me I'll give this a 9/10.",2022-09-11
"""Do I look like some kind of monster""? Keith (Bill Skaarsgard)I may be at the point when a horror/thriller character goes into the basement, I walk out because of that common cliché's boredom factor. Yet, I'm glad I stayed for Barbarian, a slick horror film satisfying an urge to see privileged 20 somethings face doom for their arrogance and naivete stupidity.More than my low-level schadenfreude is the comic use of the horror/thriller formula, whose elements are preserved from time-immemorial with just enough freshness to keep audience interest and themes intact. Tess (Georgina Campbell) has rented an Airbnb
bungalow in run-down Detroit for her job interview the next day. When the lockbox contains no key, it's the first sign of trouble from writer/director Zach Creeger.Keith is inside the house, for he has rented it through another company. Given he is played by Bill Skaarsgard of Pennywise ""It"" fame, we downright know she's in trouble. To make things the worst, he gets lost in the basement, and she goes through its labyrinthine tunnels to find him! Mercy me, no one should go there, even smart-ass young'uns. Underneath this shabby house and hood lurk pale creatures like cave dwellers in The Descent.At any rate, enough gory material is offered for those who like that stuff and enough heady material for those who dive deep into psychology such as seeing a parallel with Hitchcock's Psycho. Yes, Bill could remind you of Anthony Perkins and Georgina could Janet Leigh, and all are affected by the hotel business, so to speak.Thematically, Barbarian is solid with its reliance on the suffering and the horror of being poor, including a deformed mother (Matthew Patrick Davis), who longs for her baby, beating up the inexperienced young folk. If you don't believe someone is so clueless as to explore a basement in a rental, see Barbarian, for you will never rent again anyway.",2022-09-10
"BARBARIAN (2022) *** Georgina Campbell, Bill Skarsgard, Justin Long, Matthew Patrick Davis, Richard Brake. When a young woman arrives at an Airbnb she gets more than she bargained for when she discovers some truly unsettling developments on the premises. Directed within an inch of its life by Zach Cregger who pulls out all the stops and horror tropes that go from the 'Don't' factor to a whole lot of WTF! Sprinkled with some out of left field comedy and dread enducing to the nth degree with some genuine scares and violent set pieces yet the plot echoes 'DON'T BREATHE' and the atmosphere suggests early Wes Craven. Original, unsettling and altogether weird it's definitely a must see.",2022-09-12
"Tess (played by Georgina Campbell) just makes such dumb decisions that it is hard to take any of this seriously.The little tension there is in the first part of this film is thrown away as the film seems to reboot with the introduction of AJ (played by Justin Long). While we possibly need to understand something of AJ's character and we certainly need to understand his motivation for becoming involved in the story, he could have been introduced in a way that didn't feel so jarring.The flashback towards the end is another piece of clumsy storytelling. (Andre explains much of the backstory, so the flashback could have been omitted.)All in all, there's nothing here that's anything more than mildly scary and nothing that makes this worth watching.",2022-12-22
Why are you making me watch the beginning of this lame plot character build up and then the stupidity begins. Why are you making viewers watch these two bond for that length of time. Who exactly is the naked woman searching for at night in an abandoned neighborhood when her father was abducting women ?? Woman is a product of 40 years of inbreeding ??? How does that even make any sense ?in what world are you going to produce an offspring of that magnitude in 40 years ?? If you're going toThis is more of a comedy than anything substantial. It just falls apart the more it moves along.Such a shame. All that money for production and no meat and potatoes. Lame.,2022-09-10
"BARBARIAN was a film of two halves for me, with a really good and tension-filled first half which keeps you guessing throughout. It goes for the low-key Blumhouse approach and elicits a couple of fine understated performances from Campbell and Skarsgard to strong effect. The Detroit setting is extremely well evoked and some of the subterranean sequences are wonderfully creepy, so that's all for the good. Unfortunately there's a tonal shift halfway through when things get more explicit and rather juvenile at times. We don't need gross-out bits in films like this, even if I did appreciate the overall subtext about male behaviour. Maybe some female involvement behind the camera would have worked better.",2023-01-11
"The movie had potential, but somewhere in the middle it became the typical idiotic horror story with characters acting predictable. The second part of the movie was a parody of a horror rather than horror.At the beginning we see characters address typical horror features, kind of poking the viewer saying this is not your typical horror. We are left guessing whether Keith is going to be the monster or not. Thus, the movie is intense, mysterious, atmospheric. That all changes in the second part. It becomes the definition of word stupid.No matter how deep the message may be, there is no excuse to execute it as terribly as The Barbarian did. The first part combined with the ridiculous second part does not complement the movie's message one bit. If anything, it makes one disappointed.Also, it does not answer many important questions. Where are the bodies of those locked, raped, and, inbred women? How does the barbarian survives the fall? How does she has superheroes powers? Does this mean inbred people are superior in strength? Have I missed something? The first part tells us this is supposed to be realistic. The second part negates it. So, what is this movie? Ok, whatever, now I am just nitpicking.",2022-12-29

"I was expecting so much from this movie. The tense atmosphere in the trailer was so interesting. Finally i got the chance to watch the movie and i was so disappointed. First of all this movie is not even a proper horror movie and it seemed like a comedy.Many viewers have already mentioned many points in their reviews. So i will not get into those.Some of the main points which i would like to discuss are
1. The dumb decisions made by the main characters. Who would walk into a dark room or tunnel without knowing what is on the other side. That too speaking loudly?2. After finding a hidden room with a bed, bucket and camera why would anyone want to still live in the house??3. If the creature woman comes out in night why didn't she took the two characters on the first night??why she waited for them to come to the hidden room and find her?? Wow! Hats off to the writers!!4. The most likable character Keith was killed in the first half?? Why?5, Why would you risk your live twice for some random strangers?? Why??6. You had so many chances to leave the town but somehow you wanted to get yourself in trouble.7. How come the creature woman was so strong?? She remained in the cave for her whole life She was more stronger than hulk. ( yeah no kidding)8. Why the Airbnb house was overbooked in the first place?? Why? We are never given any explanation.9. So the creature woman falls from a 50 foot plus water tower and lands on her back with a 50kg woman on top and still can survive?? How? How she became a super soldier in these years? Some sort of secret experiment by government??10. How was the villain who brought all the kidnapped all these women in the house was still alive? What he ate during all these years??11. So according to the movie the serial killer made babies with all the kidnapped women? Where were all the babies?? Where were all the women?? Even there were no bodies.. so weird.12. Why the character AJ was so dumb in the first place??13. What was with the basement door?? Some sort of booby trap??14. OMG so many more points to discuss. But i think i will stop here as i don't want to waste anymore time on this movie'NOT RECOMMENDED!! Save yourself while you can from this torture..",2022-11-01
"Awful.... I mean, truly awful.You know those horrors in which the main characters make stupid, idiotic decisions that no-one in their right mind would ever do? Well, in this one, literally EVERY decision made by EVERY character is so incomprehensibly dumb and logic-defying that you quickly start to hope the main protagonists will be horribly killed just to remove their dumb asses from the gene pool. Every opportunity to escape the situation is refused; every opportunity to get help is wasted.

"It starts very well, with the scenes from the trailer, those scenes that pulled us to watch this movie, we were quite hyped. But after the first act of the movie, the writers decided to mess up the whole thing. It's a shame, really, this had potential to be one of the best horror movies of the last 5 years, but it's just another bad movie made by modern Hollywood. If you're wondering if this movie is free of political propaganda, I'm sorry to tell you, it's full of it (after the 1st act). I thought Hollywood moved on from the ""me too movement"" after 4 years of movies and tv shows full of it, but it seems it's back. ""Men, like, omg, do better""Anyway, the protagonist actress is very good, Bill's performance is amazing too (too bad his time is too short, I wonder why, since he's the best actor in the whole cast)... and that's it. A disappointing movie, full of plot holes. Bait and switch, basically.There's a reason why they only showed scenes from the 1st Act in the trailer, they knew no one would watch this movie if they showed the stupid useless scenes from the act 2 and act 3.Anyway, this is a Jordan Peele type of ""horror"" movie, watchable but weak and stupid.To anyone (like me) disappointed with this movie and left with a bad taste in their mouth after wasting 1h40m watching this, I recommend you watching (or re-watching) 10 Cloverfield Lane, a real good Horror movie, that has a real great female protagonist and evil men, but (surprise!) no political propaganda!

"Yeah, after that amazing first act, with awesome characters, a great premise, an a subtle GOOD social message that didn't distract from the horror movie... all got in flames inmediatly by the start of the second act, with the introduction of Justin Long, a horrendous actor, and his character, a walking and talking MESSAGE (well, most of it becomes a message) instead of just a character that is bad, but human.When the movie tries to connect the dots of the story, themes and characters, it fails to fit the supernatural horror elements with the realistic ones and both are interrupted constantly by the need to MAKE THE MESSAGE CLEARER AND CLEARER (a good message, by the way).Of course critics loved it, because of the message. And of course I failed to recognize it would be like this. At the same time, I loved the first act, so I guess I don't regret seeing it.",2022-12-27

The whole side plot with the sex assault actor was so pointless and just dragged on and didn't go anywhere. Is this still the same movie?? When the sexy mutant did a swan dive off the top of the building I lmfao'd so hard. Baaaaaaby. The story was literally just all over the place.

Not a single character in the movie behaves like a sane adult if they were put in similar circumstances. The actors are cartoonish and they have zero depth. They are just in for their paychecks, which, they shouldn't get in full, because they did a terribly bad job.

Why was this house in the middle of an absolute ghetto and no one seem to notice until they got to the house? The beginnings seemed so good, but then there was this weird pause and a secondary story was introduced that had very little backstory or meaning to the entire movie. Characters were very undeveloped and the entire premise relied on stupid people doing stupid things that no real person would ever do in real life.

"Is it just me, or is the horror genre in a really healthy way at the moment? Great horror films like 'Barbarian' are starting to feel like the norm, rather than the exception. It's great. Boy I had a lot of fun with this movie.This feels like a film where writer/director Zach Cregger was in total control. He directs a brilliant opening segment with tension, mystery and a pay off - and then abruptly cuts away to start introducing a fresh character. Not many filmmakers would have the guts to completely erase all the momentum they have worked incredibly hard to build up, only to start from scratch again. He made it work though.When this film is tense, it is very tense. The underground setting is nearly the perfect stage for horror to flourish. It's dark, it's claustrophobic, it looks very easy to get lost and you never know what is around the corner.Finally the dialogue in this movie was perfect. Likeable characters (even the despicable ones had charm) having really interesting interactions. This is how you set up a horror movie. You make us care about the people in it, and then you put them in peril. This one was great. Highly recommend. 9/10.",2022-10-26
"Don't bother unless you enjoy yelling at the screen because you cannot believe how stupid the characters are, to the point where it is unbelievable. It isn't like they make one or two stupid moves; the stupid moves never stop. Waste of time. I've never been so annoyed with characters in a movie. The movie starts with a single woman making decisions no female would make and then gets progressively worse when the homeowner shows up. The only slightly believable reaction was the cops' reaction to the wild story, which was probably the result of not believing anyone would legitimately rent that house.",2023-01-02
". . . about a decayed decrepit demon-drenched disaster dead end known as ""Detroit."" Before being nicknamed ""The Motor City,"" this cursed crescent was home to the Saltine Tribe, who survived by trading the sacred salt underlying their Homeland for the other necessities of life. However, once European settlers horned in on the Saltine Fatherland, centuries worth of hallowed tribal salt was wrested from Mother Earth every month. Furthermore, as BARBARIAN depicts, most New Detroit homes have been constructed with basements, cellars, tunnels and sub-basements allowing residents to privately loot and plunder the Saltine heritage for their own personal profit. As pictured by BARBARIAN, reports of the Horrid Hag have persisted in Detroit since the mid-1700's. Dozens of city residents disappear without a trace annually, and the local police agencies are trained to callously ignore and squelch media reports of such happenings, BARBARIAN faithfully reveals. So unless you're totally suicidal, do NOT ever set foot in Detroit!",2022-09-09
"I went into this one with high expectations from other reviews and hype from around the internet. Unfortunately it was all wind.The first half of the movie is compelling and atmospheric. The chemistry between the two main characters of this half was top notch, and Skarsgard was believable and just a little creepy.However, the second half empties all the tension and atmosphere of the first. It's almost as though the writing and directing team left the room and gave it over to a bloke who walked in from the street.Massively. Disappointing.Spoilers - in the final act, was I really supposed to believe that
1. AJ heaved Tess over the edge of the water tower one handed?2. She fell so slowly that the Mother could catch up and position herself between the ground and Tess?3. That both Tess and the Mother were **completely uninjured** by the fall?!?",2023-01-12
First act was decent. Which was like 30 minutes long.Should have been a YouTube short.The rest of the movie is a disaster. I don't remember the last time I've seen something so bad.No idea why this movie has such a big review score. Guess I should stop trusting IMDB ratings.Now I need to type 300 more characters in order to post this review so I am just going to type trash cause this movie is not worth me actually breaking it down and explain anything.

The first 30 minutes were actually great, good suspense, mystery, interesting plot, then it NOSE dived into the literal worst theater experience I've ever had. What a freaking joke, I want my money back. I've learned my lesson, never trust IMDb reviews. Only trust word of mouth. Unfortunately I went in blind. I feel sorry for the cast/actors, they performed well, but this movie should not have been made. I don't know who the target audience is, maybe 15 year old girls? Had a decent amount of potential with the first 30 minutes, interesting setting, and actors, until it was flushed down the drain when the plot revealed itself. I feel tricked.",2022-10-22
"By ten minutes into the film we are supposed to believe that a woman who is applying for a white collar job in a prestigous downtown corporate office is going to book a room at a house in what is worse than any ghetto I have ever seen (every other house on the street is literally destroyed and uninhabital. It looks like the Dresden bombings and a crack epidemic happened to the neigborhood at the same time).It would never happen. It's absurd.But wait!... then we're supposed to believe another guy chose to stay there too!There would never in a million years be a remodelled, modernized Air bnb on a street like this. It would be illegal on so many levels, and no one with a working brain would ever want to stay there, let alone it being a viable business for 20 years.So why is Hollywood continually making movies for people who forgot how to think?? This is not asking us to ""suspend our disbelief""... this is asking for us to be retarded! With so many positive reviews I am very, very concerned for the millenial generation and those to come.But I continued to watch because I was bored and had nothing better, and here is what I got.1. A ""horror movie"" that was not at all scary and way more laughable in a bad way.2. More ridiculous defying the laws of logic and physics, ie. A girl falls well over 50 feet off a giant fule/water tank and she gets up and walks away from it. LMAO.3. A shift out of left field into another time and place and charcters 4. A shift back.5. ANOTHER SHIFT to a new time and more new characters... like STOP! Who cares anymore!? Make ONE cohesive movie! Not three slapped together.And finally... 6. The ""monster"" is hilariously funny, not scary at all, has a ridiculous back story, has ridiculous behavior, also defies gravity, physics and logic in what it can and can't do... etc. Etc. Etc.Hollywood gave the masses another prize for the ultra stupid, and sadly many people gobbled it up because it's probably the best their going to get.",2022-11-21
"I don't get the raving reviews? Horror is my favorite genre, and I still found this completely uninteresting! It was like some stuff happened, then someone was killed, then some more stuff happened, and a guy that needed money. Adding 3 people to the stupid stuff that was happening,There was a basement door (oohh.. scary!!) with more basements, and more doors, which came with (you guessed it) more fear of death, or just stupid scare jumps. There's a homeless guy that comes along, now there's more people to kill.. blah-blah-blahFinally, you realize who the d-bag was at the end, and hate yourself for watching this movie.RECOMMENDATION: I wouldn't watch this for free on a streaming service, much less pay to see it in the movie theaters!! SKIP IT... the movie was terrible!!",2022-09-17
"I am amazed at how many good reviews this movie has because this movie was awful. I almost fell asleep on it and I've never done that during a horror movie. If you are reading this and you have not seen this movie yet, please do not buy into the hype that is being sold around this movie.I've seen this get compared to The Exorcist, Evil Dead, Jeepers Creepers and a ton of other BETTER horror films. When in all actuality this movie is more like someone who seen Don't Breathe and went ""you know what would have been better if they had"".... and this movie was made.The movie started off well and then just went all the way downhill especially when Justin Long's character shows up and transitions the movie from a horror to a comedy and kills the atmosphere and tension that was being built.You don't need to see this with a crowd, there is no hooting and hollering moments here, but there are a lot of dumb decisions being made by the main character. There are also things that are not explained or given enough back story to which is always frustrating. The movie ends flat and I most definitely walked out thinking wtf did I just watch but for all the wrong reasons. My advice would be to tamper your expectations and expect to see a very mediocre ""horror"" film.",2022-09-09
"This was just another classic Hollywood horror movie. Nothing here was smart or educative which is very typical of Hollywood horror movies unfortunately. You have a couple of people making rather really stupid decisions and you are forced to sit and watch things unfold. Frankly I don't know how the writers expect the viewers to feel for the victims when they clearly deserve what they got.I guess I kept watching because the acting was really good and I liked the both of them from other movies. I wish they had done more as far as the backstory goes, that one scene just didn't do much. Now thinking about it, the backstory would have made a much better movie than the main movie. How ironic.",2023-01-24
"I think the ratings on this movie have been fabricated and are not a true representation of what most people think. I am sure a lot of these high ratings are done by people hired by the movie company so people will be encouraged to go see it. It is a real low budget movie, half of it takes place in an underground hallway, they must of saved a fortune on lighting and set design, it has a lot of nothing going on to draw it out to fill a time slot. The plot is hodgepodge. A movie is scary if it is realistic the monster and the plot are silly. If you want to be scared just turn on your local news channel and save the price of a theatre ticket.",2022-11-10
I was so excited watching lots of good reviews and while watching the first half I was like okay this has good buildup. It has potential for a good movie but it went downhill so fast that it couldn't recover.But the 2nd half of the movie disappointed me so much. There are too many plotholes with 0 explanation of anything. The characters made at least thousands of mistakes. But in reality this is not possible at all. This movie was made just to show horror without any sense.Don't believe the hype and better watch something else. Go for it for the scares but at the end of the movie you would think of it as a huge time waste.,2022-09-10
"I wanted to see this movie so badly, and all that desire turned into disappointment. Let's just say that started so good...the idea of Bill Skarsgard (Pennywise), and Justin Long (from Jeepers Creepers) in a horror movie was incredible...and then this movie happened. I think everything was great until, the Psycho twist...the main character gets savagely murdered. Then every decision that you thought was stupid in the beginning, continued increasing into a cartoon level idiotic nonsense. Then stupidity not only took over the characters, but into the plot, the direction, and the production. Some stupidity could even be compared with Plan 9 from Outer Space, in the same scene the stupid girl, after trying to convince 2 stupid cops, goes into the house and all of the sudden is dark outside. But that's not all, a water tower appears out of nowhere, from where the stupid girl was pushed and then the stupid monster jumps after her...but then after the fall, Stupid girl is on top of stupid monster. It's ok that in horror movies we are used to people that won't die, but this is Road Runner's magic powers for everyone. I give it a 2, because the acting was fine...and it didn't look like an indie. I wonder how much the production payed for the good reviews.",2022-10-25
"This movie had so much potential. The setting, actors, & first half of the movie were great. Once the movie got going the 2nd half didn't explain enough and had way too many holes in it. Unfortunately I hate whenever a movie is supposed to be serious & realistic then has a ton of unrealistic supernatural elements.The holes include the cops not taking a hostage victim serious without even looking into the situation. The people in the community supposedly know about the ""monster"" without ever calling the police. The being that was produced via incest relationships with the father was around 7 feet tall & unkillable by being ran over with a car and falling from over 20 feet but yet a small gun shot ended her. Way too many holes but good try.",2022-09-09
"I really was never sure if this was a comedy or a thriller. I literally laughed out loud in the theater at parts of the movie that may have been intended to be scary. The first 30 minutes of this film felt like a masterpiece. The rest was a hot mess. I feel like there were great actors, great ideas and then felt like Jerry Lewis stepped in. Predictable then unpredictable then laughable then scary. A hot mess! We were glad to have a theater experience and seriously appreciated the cinematography but git lost in a plot that felt like a trip through a middle school haunted house. The tunnels, the home, the neighborhood all screamed horror
Then the characters, the milk bottle, the character landing on top of the monster that fell second, all felt like a comedy.",2022-09-13
"I saw Barbarian, starring Georgina Campbell-All My Friends Hate Me, Krypton_tv; Bill Skarsgard-Eternals, Pennywise in the new It movies; Justin Long-New Girl_tv, Dodgeball and Richard Brake-Game of Thrones_tv, Thor:The Dark World.This is a great horror movie that is both scary and funny-Justin provides most of the funny moments. Georgina plays a young woman that is going for a job interview in Detroit. She reserves an Airbnb but when she gets there, she finds that Bill is already there, saying the same thing, that he booked the house. It's pouring down raining so Bill talks her into staying the night and straightening out the over booking problem in the morning. Georgina reluctantly agrees. They soon discover that there is someone else in the house. Justin plays an actor that owns the house and he has problems of his own-sexual allegations from an actress-and Richard owned the house before Justin.It's rated R for violence, gore, language and sexual content-including extreme nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 42 minutes.I really liked this one and would buy it on Blu_Ray.",2022-09-08
"Well, what can I say. I really really like the first half of the movie. The tension and nervoysness between Tess and Keith was great and I really warmed to the characters and was completely intrigued by what would develop, especially when Tess finds the hidden room. Then, bam, the movie takes a completely different direction that is completely absurd for many reasons.1. Why does ""the mother"" have superhuman strength?2. Why don't the police believe her and not follow up properly?3. Why does ""the mother"" just let her shoot her in the head? There's no reason for her to do this
4. Why does the guy in the cellar kill himself? There's no reason for him to do this either
5. How does the vagrant guy know everything about what's going on inside the house?I could go on and on. Like I said, I really liked the 1st half of the film and my 3* review is for that. 2nd half gets 0*",2022-11-25
I guess 7 stars means 70% of the people who watched this movie are brain dead. I don't care what you liked about the movie. The stupidity for the first girl to go down there when she was already about to leave in a frantic horror makes no sense at all. It defies all logic. Gee whiz. Sorry I am going to duplicate this but I have to since IMDb now has this minimum characters list.I guess 7 stars means 70% of people who watched this movie are brain dead.

"This movie starts great: tense, ambiguous, unsettling; it seems like the first act of an engaging thriller. And then it ends. The second act switches gears completely and focuses on the machinations and tribulations of a Hollywood predator, which is both refreshing (insofar as Hollywood finally admits that Hollywood predators are the histrionic denizens of Hollywood rather than villifying normal men in some cockamamie attempt expurgate the sins of Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, etc.) and a trite excuse to cram #metoo messaging into a movie in which it has no logical place. The less said about the third act the better. Barbarian plays out like three short movies tenuously stitched together but only the first is worth watching.",2023-02-24
"The first 30 minutes were great. It seemed promising, but then it all crumbled. If Bill Skargard's character, Keith, would've turned out to be a creep, the movie would've been so much better and scarier, as it would've been more realistic. Plot twists in movies are either a hit or miss. In this film, it was definitely a miss.So there's a literal inbred, superhuman-like creature living in a hidden dungeon in the basement with her rapist father? It's far fetched and very unlikely. The homeless man saying that the old lady comes out at night, yet has never messed with him, being that the neighborhood is pretty much deserted with vacant homes, and he's the only there makes absolutely no sense.I also didn't like how the police were portrayed as careless, completely oblivious and unreliable. Tess has several chances to escape and doesn't. The part where she goes and grabs her car keys, gets in her car and then jams her car into the inbred woman with super strength, and still she doesn't die? Plllease! Utter nonsense.I can't believe that this movie has such high ratings. I'm extremely disappointed and mad that I wasted my time watching this. It was so good at first. If only they would've just kept it realistic, the movie could've been great. Absolutely Ridiculous.",2022-12-05
"I haven't seen a horror movie in a long time, so today I chose the new ""Barbarian"". The last 30 minutes are the most terrifying moments.However, because it was an amateur performance, I laughed when the monster said ""blah blah blah"". It has no frightening effect.This movie is very similar to the old 8mm video ""The Blair Witch Project"" and the Japanese horror movie ""Ring"". The scene where the VHS video comes out.The actors acted naturally and well.When it comes to spooky monsters living underground, my favorite is Michael Myers from ""Halloween."" It's enough to see this movie once, so 3 stars.",2023-01-19
"The trailer for ""Barbarian"" was quite simple for me, but the good reviews and its high ratings led me to see it. At first it seemed faithful to the trailer but without charm as I suspected, soon the suspense and mystery are joined by a talented cast and some gloomy filming locations and the script explodes in quality, proving that the trailer is only the tip of the iceberg. Noteworthy are the special makeup effects that are realistic and barbaric. Georgina Campbell, Bill Skarsgård, Justin Long and Matthew Patrick Davis offer good performances, playing characters that click with the viewer or obnoxious characters that fit well in this story. A modern horror movie classic!",2022-09-22
"I hardly pen down negative reviews because most times, the ratings would already be down or average so, I simply just ignore a terrible movie. But I'm so pissed off at this cos I enjoyed SMILE with a much lower rating where as this was utter RUBBISH!! Take away just 1/3rd of the dumb decisions in this movie and they wouldn't have had anything to act at all. I tried hard just as I always do while watching a horror movie to put myself in the shoes of the characters just to justify their actions but at key moments, they decide on going with the dumbest decision a human being can make. It's so off putting and if you are a fan of horror, avoid this at all cost. The ratings are definitely doctored and you can't tell me otherwise. Even the story itself which would have been explored better was ignored and the run time was spent on useless scenes. It had a nice concept but the execution was absolutely awful. Hell, I even beat my minimum limit due to having so much faults against this movie.",2022-12-01
"This movie was riddled with lunatic decisions by the lead character:1. She shows up at an Air BnB in a town she hasn't visited. In an area she doesn't know. Alone. She doesn't bring a friend, a family member for the night, a cousin. Nobody. A young woman. By herself. Brings noone.2. She gets to the Air BnB. It's late. She sees a man inside. A man. A man taller than her. She rings the doorbell. Chats with him. Says the place is hers. She doesn't immediately get out of there. She doesn't park in a Wal-Mart parking lot and sleep the night in her vehicle as everyone does. She doesn't look for a hostel, a dorm, a police station parking lot. No. SHE GOES INSIDE.3. She goes inside. Sure she's a little cautious, but so what? He can knock you out, tie you up, lock you in his basement? What if he placed the ad? What if that's what he does?4. STAYS THE NIGHT. Locks her door. But if that was a killer? A little old door lock won't save you if he has a key or if he kicks the door in.5. During the night her locked door is now opened. Not enough for you pal? You locked your door. And now it is open. Still no red flags? She hears the guy sleeping on the couch have nightmares. She goes over to wake him?6. She leaves for her job interview. She notices that every house in the area is abandoned, burnt, falling apart, except for the one Air BnB.7. The woman at the job interview tells her not to stay in that area. She doesn't listen. She goes back. A man runs at her. Instead of jumping in her car. She runs into the house. Not into her car which she knows. But into the house which she doesn't.8. She goes into the basement. Yes. She gets locked in. Then she pulls a rope. Finds a grungy creepy door into a dark room. SHE WALKS INTO THE DARK ROOM. She finds a bed and it looks like something heinous happened down there. She is helped escape. She sees the guy. Tells him what happened.9. The guy tries to stop her from leaving and blocks her entrance to the front door.10. THEN SHE GOES BACK INTO THAT BASEMENT AFTER HIM. AND FURTHER INTO THE DARKNESS. Would you do that? Would anybody you know do that? Wouldn't you solo or both IMMEDIATELY LEAVE TO A POLICE STATION?? No what you want to do is go straight away into a dark strange blood filled basement with videocamera and torture. That's what we all want, no?I was watching with people and we turned it off because it is sooo desperately stupid. Not a single decision this lead character does makes any, sense, at, all.It's competently directed, but man oh man is it badly written.NOTHING the lead protagonist does is what a sane human being would do. Take 10 Cloverfield Lane. The lead character makes smart decisions almost the entirety of the movie. So we are on side with her. We want her to get free and escape. In this movie we in fact WANT this idiot to be caught, however we wish it was the writer.",2023-04-09
"There's no way this is a 7.1 out of 10 movie, the whole thing is juvenile at best, she makes silly choices right from the start, who in this day and age doesn't street view when they are renting a place, especially the dilapidated streets of Detroit, then lets assume like every other young person out there that she wouldn't phone Mom or a friend or somebody and say there is a weird guy here at my rental, what should I do? So she stays like any female would do right? Lol, then hears weird stuff and her door is open at night and she's still ok with that and gets up in the AM and finds out she's in a dump but doesn't grab her belongings and just beat it after the interview like any other human under 80 in the whole world would do let alone a Z or Millennial female.And why exactly would she be staying after her meeting? Wouldn't you go back where you came from and wait to hear the outcome? You think you're starting next Monday or something and should stick around? Lol. Then you get the K guy getting smashed out, her being trapped for the 2nd time until old Justin Long shows up, another oblivious tool who does the exact opposite of what any normal person would do who had rental house in the middle of a war zone, measure the place and search Google to see if the creepy basement adds value to your $50K house among $1000 houses. Sure, makes sense.None of it makes sense, then the silly flashback to the 70s, the homeless guy saving her, warning her and then going back because she has to save that unknown guy, lol, as if. Total failure and it's as ridiculous as saying a Hallmark Movie represents real life. Bad acting all around except the Skarsgard guy. Long fails again like he did in Drag Me To Hell and Jeepers Creepers, they should just let him stick to comedy like Idiocracy or Accepted where he can be just average and nobody cares. He's a 1000 lb anchor as far as horror movies go, and this was a dog of a movie. Stick to The Conjuring universe or a classic horror thrillers rather than waste your time on Barbarian, the creature? Hilarious and laughed so hard at it, wish I could say the movie didn't make me laugh as well.",2022-12-11
"I don't know why this movie is getting such high ratings. I am not saying that it's bad but it's not that good either. The movie starts with a promising note and then suddenly the pace and tone of the movie changes. After 30-40 minutes, I started feeling bored as I felt that the movie started dragging after that. The main highlight of the movie needed to be the suspense part which was underwhelming, in my opinion. I was also unable to connect with the characters.Overall, I had good expectations for this movie but it proved to be an average thriller drama which I don't think will recommend to anyone.",2022-10-26
"I suppose if nothing else you can give Barbarian a few points for some originality. Conceptually it's pretty different than most other horror movies and not everything can be clearly predicted. However, it's still pretty loose in its logic careless in its execution and honestly a lot of what's intended to make you scream makes you laugh. I think it was partially intentional and partially not but every character in it is unlikable and you couldn't care less what happens. This movie lies at just the bottom of the barrel so its definetly bad but it hasn't quite fallen through the bottom to make it bad enough where you can have more to say about.",2023-01-29
"I just don't get the high ratings. To start with, the trailer shows it all. There was nothing extra except something my husband and I laughed outload at. You will get it when you see it. You can't miss what I'm saying.The movie starts with 45 minutes of character building. Finally, something happens and then another character is added and we sit back and let the character build again and again. Unfortunately, there is only a small amount of horror/thrill to it. Lot's of unforeseen laughter.I definitely recommend saving your money and watching this on (netflix etc.) Then you can walk away from it guilt free, knowing you didn't pay for this on the big screen.",2022-09-16
"Just came back from this & still am at a loss as to what I just watched. A friend of mine said this film was amazing, I however was skeptical... & I was right to be after watching...The film sees a young girl going to an Air Bnb, only to find it's already occupied, but, once she spends the night at the place & ventures into the basement, she discovers something sinister.I found the film to be pretty boring. The story for starters is pretty boring & the engagement of it alone is a yawnfest. The characters are pretty disengaging too, along with the pointless drawn out scenarios which already add to the problem of the film. It starts with one story, then chops to another characters story (which see him enter the same house) & then another... in all, the chopping, changing of characters along with the plodding, sluggish pacing just adds to the frustration as to what is in the house & whom.The film is only 1 hour & 37 minutes long, but feels way, way longer. The film feature little in terms of horror & lacks in gore & action. The film itself is just weird & out there & expects you as the viewer to know what's what, there's so many plot holes, unanswered questions & more. The first hour alone just adds nothing (plods along with little to no horror) & it's only until the last 30 odd minutes that something does happen & the film sort gets going.Another thing I disliked was the films message & the portrayal of the male characters, can't a film just not have any of that drivel in there? No, not in this day & age, but hey, it's 2022 I suppose... Every male character has to be portrayed as bad in some way, shape or form, whether it be evil, dumb, stupid, perverse, selfish, cowardly, deadbeat or a red herring. It really ruins the film when it insults me & other male audience members in the cinema.Overall, it's a 97 minute bore-fest. Skit this one, you're not missing much, at all. The story is bad, the characters are all unlikable, the male characters are all portrayed as bad & the pacing & runtime are abysmal. I wouldn't recommend it & would certainly say it adds to the every growing list of bad horrors this year. I guess 2022 isn't the year for horrors... shame...1/10.",2022-11-01

"Before I dig into what I didn't like here, I'll discuss what I thought was good. Cinematography as a whole was excellent, some of the best in a long time. Soundtrack was also great. The first act of this movie was incredible. If the goal was for us not to know whether or not Keith was good or bad, they succeeded. The suspense and tension was certainly there. But then, we get into Act 2. This is essentially where this whole thing fell off. Below are a series of questions that never got answer.Why did the double booking happen? Was it just a happenstance plot device that was the only way the story could occur?Why did the rental company deny that Keith and Tess were there once AJ showed up?Why did the person conducting Tess' job interview say that the area Tess was staying in is one she should not be in? It had a very sinister tone without a real purpose. Maybe she just thought a girl shouldn't be alone by herself in a rough area.What about the guy who originally lived in the house? Was all that just to give context to the camera room and such? Why'd he have 10 minutes of screen time to himself if he was gonna go out the way he did?Was the house haunted by ghosts or just the energy of this monstrous lady living in the underground below the home?These are just a series of loose ends.Ultimately, the movie had SO much potential and had a perfect setup. The tension was right, the suspense was perfect. The acting was great across the board. They knew when to blend comedy into it. I just didn't like the fact that they had so many good potential plot devices that the writers just forgot about.",2022-09-13
"For the first hour or so, I thought I was going to really enjoy it. I love the way you think it's going to be a thriller about a girl stuck in a house with a creepy guy and then it takes a hard left turn. Using Bill Skarsgard was a brilliant idea because you automatically associate him as a villain, so you don't expect what happens to him pretty early on. I can't say it's the most surprising thing that's happened in a film, but still interesting.The movie lost me completely when the police officers showed up. There is no police officer who would see Tess the way she was looking in that scene and think she was lying about being kidnapped. I kept expecting them to be in on it, but nope. They're just poorly written. When they drove off, the car drives away slowly and it looks like the driver is giving a sinister look. But it turns out it was just an opportunity for the writer to milk his cameo.After that, it seemed like every single thing that happened was written by a middle schooler. Everything was so messy and contrived. It feels like the writer came up with a concept they liked and thought that was enough to make a good movie, without having to put any effort into making a good script. What a letdown.",2022-12-31
"I watched this movie with friends over the weekend to celebrate Halloween and, while we were talking a lot during its runtime, no scene succeeded in scaring nor surprising me. This film felt like a standard horror film with all the usual beats -- weird thing happening in home, investigation of said weird thing, some characters get caught in the process, historical exposition of the phenomenon, and resolution at end. The film was formed from a mold that so many other movies have used and nothing really stood out to me as original. There was some strange sub-textual message about men taking advantage of women. Yet, that point is so loosely tied to the story, like everything else in this movie, that I couldn't help but feel disappointed at the end.",2022-10-31

The main character georgina great too. But...Second part wtf! I just don't like horror movies were characters make dumb mistakes. The second part character was annoying as hell.

"With the top reviews!This is not a horror! I love horror movies and watch almost only horror movies. I was excited to watch this cause of the high rating and also the description. Now I am so dissapointed, I suffer from cognitive dissonance and PTSD because of the traumatic events that went completely downhill.I will sum the movie up for you!Tess rents a house in a crackhead neighbourhood. There is already a man there named keith cause they got double booked. Tess gets locked in the basement idiotically, finds a dungeon, and a secret door, then saved by keith then goes back so Keith can see, afrer two minutes he is gone. Tess goes after keith gets killed by the monster. A naked woman with supernatural powers.New movie Aj drives a cat, gets accused of rape, has to sell his property the house rented to Tess and Keith. He never knew about the basement but finds it cause the door is open. Goes down to measure the area so he can sell ot for a higher bid. Get captured by the monster and put in a dungeon with Tess. Tess escapes while the monster tries to breastfeed AJ . She runs to a ohine, calls the police who dont want to listen to her. This was a try to make the police look bad. She crashes the car in to the monster who runs out of the house.a homeless man tries to save tess and tells her to run and ""she isnt the worst thing down there"" but never do we find out what is. Aj finds an old man who shoots himself and noone knows why. He then takes the gun and runs, shooting Tess who came back for him. They run to the water tower where rhe homeless man tries to save them. But the monster comes chasing them. Aj turns schizophrenic and throws Tess down from the water tower. Monster jumps after saving the shot wounded Tess somehow and herself. Aj comes closer and gets killed by the monster. Tess shoots the monster and the movie ends.We know nothing we didnt see anything, this movie isnt scary! It's ridiculous. There is absolutely no sort of reason or even logic or horrifying in this movie. The first 30 min were good ! Interesting and got me watching then it just made a free fall and I was literally left with a wth is this!? I am still wondering what in the name of god did I just watch!",2022-11-27
"This movie started off STRONG! It pulled me all the way in. I was immediately thinking: is this man a murderer, is he possessed, is he only a squatter...so many questions ran through my head. What ACTUALLY ends up happening is nowhere near what my mind could've imagined. On the scale of ""unique"" this one is a 10. On the scale of ""weird"" an 8.9..not the weirdest thing I've seen, but definitely up there. I feel conflicted in this rating because I want to rate the first two thirds of the movie a 7 or 8 but by the end it was a 3 or 4 at best. Sadly it lost all of its suspense, horror, and fear and it became almost comical. I appreciate that it wasn't aimless. At least there was a storyline to the chaos. But this movie could've been so great had they made it a little more creepy at the end and not so comedic. I do like a couple of laughs in a horror movie..for instance, I enjoyed Justin Long's character, but at the same time I feel like he could've been that narcissistic jerk of a character while also having a strong creepy ending without it turning to straight comedy.",2023-03-19
"I decided to watch this only because of the cast and would have never thought that these actors would agree to this crap. Sorry but what happened after the first act? It seemed so very promising and intriguing and then it went all down hill. I actually thought this would be a great thriller with those two in the same Airbnb.. thought there would be a great plot twist but that twist that happened was just silly. No background story, no explanation, only a very short scene with the great Richard Brake. It's so disappointing!And I don't even wanna start on the stupid decisions these characters made as well as how unrealistic it all is. I honestly don't get who writes this nonsense and why?!What a waste of great acting talent! 2 stars for the actors!",2023-01-22
"The film starts out pretty intriguing, it's hard to tell where it might be going, it's genuinely quite good... And then it's just a downward spiral. After about 30 or 40 minutes it goes royally off the boil. It's almost like they changed writers half way through. What really sank it for me was the r^pe/incest and inbreeding trope. Overdone, dull and lazy writing - did they have an idea board of the some shocking/weird buzz words and just put it in a film? They had a good thing going initially and then just whacked in a bunch of absolute tripe. Is it worth watching? Not really, unless you have a couple of hours to waste your time.",2023-01-11
"First off, there's a lot of rambling and filler scenes that add nothing to the movie. I felt like a lot of scenes and dialogue could have been added to make the movie have more soul.Acting is great in some areas, but absolutely laughably terrible in others.There are very loud screams, moaning, gunshots, and whatever else randomly through out the movie.Makes it very hard to watch with others in the house at a steady volume when the volume was raised from trying to hear a quiet scene...The uselessness and inactiveness of the police force was very accurate to reality, however!My review gets an extra star for the scary entity/being.",2023-01-14
"Honestly I am surprised to see all the great reviews for this movie. I will give it this, it was really interesting at first and got me hooked. From the description of it I was expecting something totally different than what I got.It is honestly one of those movies that you just have to watch for yourself to really get the feel of it. If you have almost 2 hours to waste that is. It's really not worth the time imo.Like I said, the beginning was good and the acting seems alright. But once they killed off Keith, Bill's character, it really all went to crap after that.It's almost like they changed screen writers midway through and then again for the last 20 mins. I'd honestly skip this one but definitely watch it if you don't believe the bad reviews. It'll change your mind.",2023-02-23
"The only reason I didn't give this movie a 1 is because of the exposition. The acting is refreshing and the is chemistry between Bill Skarsgard and Georgina Campbell is palpable. However the story doesn't make much sense at all. How do you double book an Airbnb? There isn't a single hotel room open...really? After seeing the neighborhood and getting warned of the danger by her interviewer, she goes back? I tried to move past all this, but unfortunately, it only got WAY worse.The movie then asks you to believe that Tess discovers a murder dungeon and she doesn't call the police? That, after discovering the dungeon, she gets locked inside the basement and she doesn't just kick the flimsy door down? When Keith is screaming for help, instead of calling the police, she goes after him without a weapon??? The movie made me feel duped. It portrayed Tess as a somewhat reasonable person, then suddenly she has no brain function. Like I'm talking 0. She is truly the dumbest horror protagonist I have ever seen. And after this point it just becomes comical.For starters how does the inbred lady have Super human strength? What could she possibly be eating down there? Is she lifting weights? Why, oh goodness, why is Tess is going in and out of that house to save random strangers? Even when the movie tries to address the obvious plot hole in that you could just call the police, it genuinely just makes things worse. They don't help, why, because she's crazy? Really? These people have a person in front of them telling them that some ones life is in danger and they just leave?! They have probable cause, and they don't even look!?!?! THEY CAN SEE THE GLASS IS BROKEN OUT NOT IN, SHE CLEARLY CAME FROM INSIDE!!!! Its infuriating. Its never ending. It could be a comedy, but its not. If this had starred Nicholas cage as the monster I would have given it a 10. Any sort of theme that the writer was trying to get across is just shadowed by pure idiocy. Why is this movie even called Barbarian?Who is the barbarian? Is it AJ because he is a bad person? Is it the magic demon inbred lady ? Or is that the whole meaning? Ah, now
were getting somewhere. So, that is the meaning of the whole movie. Who is truly the Barbarian? Is it the man who lacks empathy or the crazy lady who just wants to be a mommy defending her babies? The answer is Neither. A barbarian is an axe wielding invader. If anything, this movie is the barbarian and it invaded my living room and smashed 1:50 minutes of my life into smithereens.",2023-02-19
"Out of all the horror movies that have come and gone this year, this one doesn't dissapoint. Just like The Black Phone, this horror movie delivers the thrills and chills but it's original and uses the popularity of Airbnb to new heights. Justin Long, whom people know from the get a mac ads and Die Hard , plays second fiddle to Georgina Campbell, a newbie, as they rent an Airbnb house that might be haunted by a creature that says ba ba ba and the house is barbary street, hence the title of the film. Seeing it in dolby makes the movie shine as the vibrant colors and stunning audio make this a must see on a big screen with surround sound and recliners.",2022-09-11
"I'm only giving it 2 stars because of Bill Skarsgard. The first 20 minutes or so are actually entertaining but man - when the secret basement is found the movie goes completely off the rails and these people act like utter buffoons. Nothing even remotely makes sense for the remainder of the movie. The ""mother"" is not even remotely scary. It would have been far more terrifying had the mother been a normal, albeit disturbed, person. Not even gonna waste more time typing up this review. Just a putrid, boring, snooze fest that goes nowhere, does nothing, insults the audience and wastes two hours of your life.",2023-01-16
"In Detroit, Tess (Georgina Campbell) arrives in the night at her Airbnb rental. She can't find the key. Keith (Bill Skarsgård) is already staying at the house. Meanwhile in Hollywood, actor AJ (Justin Long) is accused of sexual misconduct.This indie horror starts with so many red flags. They are bright red lights shinning in her face and she's running right through every one of them. It's the standard horror trope. I'm willing to accept it, but it doesn't fill me with great hope. I'm just waiting for Keith to go nuts. That's when this horror goes crazy. I like the awfulness of AJ being slowly revealed. The weirdness of the crazy situation is great. I like the resolution. This is very memorable.",2022-11-05
"First 40 minutes of film are dragged around useless talking. Bill S. Has a useless role. The acting is poor, the story is clueless, the monster is laughable. I don't know what the goal was for this film but, to me, it didn't deliver anything good. I feel like it wasted time of my life that I can't have back... so boring, so many plot holes, such a waste of resources! The editing also felt very weird, at times.I love it that, in the trailer, people are screaming as if the movie was scary, lol. I was almost screaming, as well but, from exhaustion.Save yourself from this garbage and go watch something else.",2022-10-26
"This movie felt like three different movies. The initial premise was great and every vacationer's nightmare. You rent an Airbnb a only to find it already occupied. Scam? Cross platform confusion? Who knows. This could have been a great paranoid atmosphere piece. But 20 minutes or so I'm it completely changes focus with a new location, new plot, new characters. Never came back to the initial promise. Then it shifts focus and timeframe again. It ended up being just another slayer/survivor movie. Part psychological thriller, part MeToo treatise, part slasher flick, part creepy neighbor kidnapper movie. Each premise held its own promise. Together it failed. The sum of the parts is definitely much less than the sum of the whole.Seemed like a wasted effort.",2022-09-11
"The first part - everyone will know after watching until which point - is really well made. Despite a probably stupid plot background mentioned already (e.g. Air BnB location), the atmosphere starts great - I would even say excellent... a thick, scary fog, including the creepy character interaction - the acting is good, the screenplay is good and you wonder where the story will go.But excuse me... what the heck happens then? It is not the sudden change of POV, nor the unlikeable character. I could live with that. But everything becomes so incredibly stupid from then on. How each and every character behaves, what they are doing - or rather not doing...
Beside that the atmosphere is gone, the monster is not a tiny bit scary anymore and with both of that gone down the drain the movie becomes dull.Honestly, something must be off with the critics here. I have seen countless of horror movies and do actually not need a masterpiece to enjoy this genre... and even in cases where I do not agree with the majority of reviews I am either not far off or can relate to the other oppinions. But here? People must have watched a different movie.I even had to create an account here and waste 10 minutes of my life in a futile attempt to save some others 100 minutes of their life time.",2023-01-21
"A rare horror gem that actually succeeds in every way.I went in to Barbarian knowing not too much other than one measly trailer, even despite its already scarce marketing and promotion (why is that? They should be pushing this like crazy, it's actually worth the hype), and it turned out to be one of the most entertaining and thrilling movie experiences of the year and in a while! A perfect blend of modern horror, dark comedy, and fast-paced thriller - it hit all the right notes and in such a fun and addictive way.In terms of tone, it reminded me of Malignant a bit but also reminiscent of a variety of other horror classics. It truly felt like 4 movies in one but in the best way. Go in as blind as possible and I guarantee you'll find it more than refreshing. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great time. This will be one to talk about for years to come!",2022-09-09
"So the first half of the movie is awesome. They do some really great set up. Sufficiently creepy and drew me in. I was so excited for this movie and looking forward to it. The second part came out of nowhere and I spent too much time trying to figure out if I was watching the same movie I'd gotten invested in. Once they connected the two parts I thought it'd get back to the creep factor and it almost did. They just couldn't quite get me back there. It just went downhill after the second jump to something else. It could have been cool but just didn't hit the way I'd hoped and it got a bit too cheesy by the end. If it tells you anything, just about the entire trailer is from the beginning where they set up what looks to be a great horror flick but it just falls short.",2023-02-03
"I've been waiting to see Barbarian for awhile because the trailer for this film has been one of the best I've seen in a long time because it scares you while also not telling you what's going to happen in the movie. The film relies a lot on tension and does so in such an expert manner with absolutely no cheap jump scares in sight. Another positive point is how straight to the point the movie is. It starts off quickly and there is little to no fluff in the film which I prefer. This film also does something relatively new in the horror film genre by dividing the film up to involve different characters perspectives which I actually loved. I recommend you get the front row seats like me and my gf did because I think it's worth it for that first big scare. You're able to feel extremely uneasy with the sadistic theme music and the up-close experience which I love when I know I'm walking into a scary movie. Lastly, the film was written and directed by Zach Creggers who did work mostly as an actor in some small projects which really makes me curious as to how many original great scripts are not being made out there because of someone's credentials. I really recommend you go see this film in its first week!",2022-09-09
"I have no idea how this movie received a 7 star rating... after watching the first 20 minutes I was ready to leave the theater. There is no plot, hardly a backstory and it ends leaving you confused and wondering why you spent your time watching it.A girl ( Tess ) rents out a Airbnb but when arriving finds out someone man is renting as well ( Keith ). They have a grand old time talking during that night and the next day Tess gets locked in the basement and finds a secret door leading to a room with a light, camera, bucket and bloody bed. She runs up to the window to have Keith help her get out and tells him about the room, he goes to look and ends up calling for help within 1-2 minutes. Tess runs down there and sees that Keith found an even deeper creepy tunnel leading to more secret rooms with cages. Keith comes running up to Tess in a panic trying to escape and a naked deformed woman comes and bashed his head in and capturing Tess.There is hardly a backstory on this woman, no back story on the cages or rooms and only one small flash back on the original home owner who buys home birthing things then stalks a woman from the store.After about 30 minutes after finding the deformed woman a character says she isn't the worst one in the tunnels... but NEVER shows who the worst one is. Only an old decrepit man In a bed who has VHS tapes labeled with his "" victims"" and then shoots himself after being found by another man who was renting the Airbnb out.At the end the the deformed woman jumps off a water tower to save Tess after she gets pushed and they fall to what you think is their death. NOPE. The man who rents the Airbnb goes down and sees that Tess is alive and the deformed woman jumps up and kill him then becomes sad that Tess is hurt and tries to signal to go back to the house. Tess holds a gun up to the woman who becomes aware and I believe says goodbye to her and Tess kills her.. that was the ending. This review basically sums up the whole movie.Garbage.",2022-09-25
"First 30 min of the movie was a bit scary. But after this movies turn to nonsense. Main characters has lack of reasonable actions in this movie. Most of scary parts of the movie was shown at the trailer. Story didnt have end and logic at all. Save your time and money, try to avoid this movie. Because when you go to the movie you expected some sense in actions of movie heroes. But in here all acting was equals NPC in old games. Of course without that thing movie could be even worth. Fuel to fire add some untold stories of bad guys, so at the and of the movie you feels like you wached pilot version of soap opera.",2022-09-14
"I had not read a single thing about the plot or watched any trailer before seeing this film, and boy am I glad I did. All I heard was the buzz about the film that said it was must see. What a wild ride this movie was. This was a wholly unique experience for me in that I truly had no idea where the story was going or what would happen next.The first 30 minutes are honestly horror perfection. I was on the edge of my seat and in awe of how bone chilling the atmosphere was. I was genuinely frightened from the methodical build up of suspense. While the film does lose a little momentum near the end, it still manages to go out with a satisfying finish.Barbarian is a wonderful twist on the horror genre that will keep you guessing throughout.",2022-09-16
"This film started off great, then became cheesy nonsense. It felt like it was three short-story films by three different writers, then pieced together to make one film. Never mind adding in woke references and poor attempts at humor. The first act was brilliantly directed, the second felt like a different film all together, and the third act felt more like a parody cliche of every other typical horror film. And that's a shame, because I felt this really had potential to be great, instead it was misguided and muddled, and riddled with more plot holes than scares. Casting and performances, as well as the cinematography and score were all great. But they weren't enough to register anything higher than my generous 6/10. This film was overrated and underwhelming. I enjoyed Deadstream much more.",2022-11-15
"Probably one of the most original horror movies to come out in years if not decades. I really enjoyed it from beginning till the credits rolled. Quite honestly, I might do the rare thing and drop another $11 to see it again.The story is simple:
Double booked air bnb brings together an unusual couple-or maybe not so unusual
Some weird stuff happens at night in the shady part of Detroit where the house is. The neighborhood is run down except for the well manicured home the air bnb sits on. This adds to the eeriness.The house holds some seriously disturbing secrets, right down to the dirty mattress with an old school camcorder set up. The room for some reason is set apart from the rest of the house.Seriously disturbing secrets I did not see coming. I honestly could not guess what direction this horror movie was going but it goes there and it goes there full throttle.Just in time for the spooky season this movie is one scary thrill ride. Actually kinda stayed with me for a little bit afterwards. Bill Skaarsgard, the clown from it is unrecognizable and Georgina Campbell reminds me of a young Rosario Dawson.You'll have a good time finding out the secrets in this one. No spoilers because quite honestly the big reveals in this one are some of the most original I've seen in years.",2022-09-09
"Like all movies, you have to know if you're dealing with full on fantasy where there are no rules and anything can happen, as if by magic, or if you're watching an actual story depicting real life people in real life situations where rules ABOUND. This movie reels you in as though it's the latter, when in fact it is the former.The first third is good, compelling mystery/drama; you don't know what's going on really, but you are content going along for the ride. Then comes the fantasy that humans could survive in caves dug deep into the earth, below a home, in a modern city. Seemingly thousands of feet of caves and cave tunnels. And of course, the chief protagonist 'mother' is of incredible strength and ability, despite living deep in the earth with nothing more than a TV that seems to never stop playing a VHS tape.I can forgive the movie for the whole other story that they crowbar into this thing, but not where the movie goes once he's in. We are to believe that someone can jump off a building, then several seconds later someone else can jump from the same spot, and yet land before the first jumper in order to cushion their fall? Fantasy, and bad fantasy at that. You can skip this one... (I'd have gone one star, but Skarsgard is pretty good so it gets two).",2022-10-30
"In several user-reviews, specialized horror magazines, and festival article reports, I have read a couple of times already that ""Barbarian"" is the best horror movie of the year 2022. And you know what; - I tend to concur! Partially because most of the genre's output this year has been dreadful, but also - and mostly - because this film by writer/director Zach Creggar is suspenseful, absorbing, uncanny, and occasionally even downright shocking!Tess and Keith meet each other under very strange circumstances, namely when it turns out they both booked the same house in the outskirts of Detroit via Airbnb. Although very wary and skeptical at first, especially Tess, the two develop a good understanding and even look forward to spending another evening together. But strange occurrences take place at the house anyways, notably when Tess discovers a secret passageway in the basement.The biggest trump of ""Barbarian"" is, without any doubt, the unpredictable and mysterious nature of the plot. Like other reviewers already righteously pointed out, you better don't read anything in advance, and allow for the complete film to unfold in front of you. ""Barbarian"" is slow-paced but brooding with tension the entire time, with an intriguing flashback/background story, and great performances from a great cast. Of course, there are severe flaws as well, like a few totally implausible sequences and an exaggeratedly negative depiction of the Detroit Police department.Still, I observed some similarities between this film and the great H. P Lovecraft's famous story ""Lurking Fear""; and there are worse stories to get compared to if you ask me. Finally, there are a couple of brutal and sick moments, and a golden oldie (""by my little baby"" by The Ronettes) playing during the climax. If you bring all that, you deserve to be labeled best horror of the year.",2022-10-30
"About halfway through I genuinely thought ""Oh, it's a horror comedy. Silly me!"", but turns out I wasn't supposed to be laughing.I mirror what so many others have said: how is the rating for this so high?The first half of the movie is brilliantly paced with good acting and sets up what could have been an excellent horror movie.By the end we find there's no resolution to things that have been set up and the plot is exposed as having more holes than Swiss cheese!The characters' decisions aren't believable and the antagonist is laughable.There's no suspense as everything is telegraphed way ahead of time.Watch the first half then once it reaches a certain point (you'll know which one), turn it off and write your own ending.",2023-01-11

There is nothing playing like Barbarian. It is absolutely terrifying while also having some laughs in between the craziness. I personally liked that because the comedy blended itself really well with the horror aspect of it.The actors were superb. I love Bill he was fantastic in It and It Chapter 2 and he was fantastic in this movie. Justin Long for me though stole the show. I'm a huge fan and lately his roles have not been huge so I'm glad he is getting the recognition he deserves.There is not one dull moment in this movie. It will have you on the edge of your seat the whole time.Definitely the HORROR MOVIE OF THE YEAR HANDS DOWN!!!!!!!!!,2022-09-10
"The movie starts decently and keeps getting better, but the second half is not that great and the ending is not as satisfying. The movie is also more funny than scary, some part intentional and some part trying to be creepy but coming out as funny instead. I didn't expect it to be scary either, because well, I'm not 8 or 14 anymore.So first of all, the movie is obviously well-made and looks good and it's made by someone who knows how to edit and shot his movies. The acting from everyone except - surprisingly - Bill Skarsgård was great.And I say except because his acting was just weird, I haven't seen him in any other movies than It and Atomic Blonde, and I don't remember how he was in Atomic Blonde, but he was great in It, and just confusing in this movie because I actually don't know if he's only good at playing psycho killer clowns and not normal human awkward beings or if it was his character and that weird acting was intentional. Because honestly it looked and felt like bad acting and I would've thought he was a bad or novice and amateur actor if I didn't know him and hadn't seen him in It and would've thought he only got roles and got famous because of nepotism. Since I don't really know if it was intentional or Bill doesn't even have the range to play some awkward ordinary guy, I won't let it affect my rating or enjoyment of this movie, not like it was gonna anyway because it's just a nitpick and not that big of a deal.So at first I liked the way the director/writer chose to tell his story and show different characters, but I expected an actual conclusion and culmination to these subplots coming together and something more than just a survival horror ending.So even the storytelling that seemed interesting at first had a not so satisfying at the end too. I liked that we saw Justin Long's characters at first, and I liked that they showed a day in the life of the bad guy in the 80s, they didn't need to, but they actually went to shoot on those sets and drive the old cars did a good job of making it believable, so the production is good, and it's really surprising with the low budget. But when the movie finished, I realized that it was a decent idea to have two protagonists in this movie - Justin Long's character is not really a protagonist but he becomes the main character for the second and third acts of the movie -, but that made the role of the main girl less impactful and you kinda forget that she was the protagonist even. The idea would work in a tv show that has more than 5 or 6 hours of screen time, but in a movie that's not even 2 hours? No, it really doesn't work and this movie is a good example of that.Another weird and confusing thing about the storytelling is that they somehow at the same time have great subtle storytelling and also just blurt out everything and reveal by making the characters say what's going on instead of letting the viewer get it through the visuals.For example, we have that bell tied to a rope that the movie only shows the bell itself and the end of the rope once and never mentions it again through the characters talking about it or pointing it out. That bell tells us a lot about how the old guy is still alive and how he communicates with the creature (yes I'm calling her creature), and how he could survive down here. Then we have the girl character just outright say the creature wants a baby, even though we already got that from the tv in her room like not even 2 minutes ago. I know it makes sense for the character to say that to the new guy who just got there, but for the movie to reveal that to the audience this way as if they're making this for kindergarteners, it just seems like cheap storytelling.Another thing is that we see the room with the bed and camera early in the movies, then we see the backstory of the guy who lived in that house, and also they shy away from showing the videotapes he got, which is I guess it's better we imagine it than we see it, but then they just reveal everything through the homeless guy saying what the creature and the old guy is. I love me some reveals as the next guy, but this kind of storytelling and reveal is not that good.Good reveals should be like Martyrs' which gives you enough after a long time of not knowing what's going on but also ends ambiguously and it's satisfying, but this movie just doesn't know how to do reveals and let the visual storytelling reveal instead of characters just saying it. Another example is the reveal of the creature which they definitely could've played more with it and build more tension, but decided to just reveal it and it's another Hollywood's idea of creepy: crazy naked old lady with saggy knockers. I guess this is the type of horror the director decided to go with, so I can't really fault that, but I rather have the creature not be revealed until the end of the movie and have more fear of unknown aspects. But the movie is not that scary, especially after the creature's reveal and most of the parts with her that are supposed to be creepy are more funny actually.The director also seems to shy away from actually breaking the barriers and giving us something more gross and violent than a crazy old naked lady running. Like compared to Martyrs and A Serbian Film, this is a Looney Tunes show. (Though I thought even Martyrs wasn't as violent and F'd up as it could've been). So I'm kinda inclined to consider them not showing the VHS tapes as the filmmaker not having the balls to show it rather than ""not knowing and imagining it is better"", especially when they don't really hesitate to reveal the creature, and I talked a lot about the reveals too, so I don't think they're really all that into not showing us.Justin Long's character was a complete idiot in this movie especially toward the ending, but I'm not gonna really count that as a negative for the movie or the script because it kinda makes sense unlike other horror movies (RIP my wasted precious time on watching the miserable Life 2017). Some things in this movie are so predictable, like him dropping the gun like an idiot, or him shooting the girl, but some are actually surprising like when he threw her off the water tower or when his head got split in half by the Hulk creature lady (apparently, years and years of inbreeding and malnourishment gives the kid super strength and she becomes a Hulk), because I 100% expected the girl to shoot the creature in the head and save the guy, but it didn't happen. I'm not saying these predictable stuff were bad or a fault of the script, it's just an observation and I liked that these predictable stuff don't really hurt the movie and are not really a negative, unlike most horrors.All in all, I thought the production was good and the movie was well-made and shot well, but some storytelling decisions that would work better in a series instead made the second and the third act and especially the ending feel unsatisfying and since you're not with the girl protagonist most of the second half of the movie, you just don't really feel like she's the main character and doesn't get connected as much since they just decide to cut to another protagonist after 40 minutes and just forget about her for the second act.The movie is still entertaining and worth a watch, but not really a movie that you will remember as a great or even good horror and a also a great film like Hereditary.",2022-12-01
"All the characters are stupid. The plot is stupid. All the cops in this movie are stupid.

But if someone has a lazy time like me and wants to waste time this movie is recommended.And I also do not know why people rated this movie so highly. The high rating of this movie is very deceiving. As a horror movie fan, so disappointed after watching this.I wish I could negatively rate this one. The worst movie of my life.",2022-10-28
"Every male in this movie is either a creep, a rapist, or a creepy rapist. Every female is a victim, or a monster victim. Complete with a female prisoner escaping captivity, only to have the police tell her to calm down, that there's no murderer in there, that nothing is wrong, rolling eyes at a woman covered in blood. I don't know if this was supposed to be jam packed with modern political tropes upon tropes, but even if that is the case it was not well done. It becomes campy and silly about halfway through and the rest is very predictable. It had my attention at first but suspense was killed.",2023-04-01
"Are you serious? The best horror of 2022? It's not even close. It's been a long time since I've watched such second-rate, pretentious films. This is a dummy, ridiculous, stupid and superficial. They throw dust in the eyes in the form of various important social topics. But I do not see sincerity and depth in the disclosure of these topics. They serve only as a bait and a distraction, a tribute to fashion, trends. And you can get carried away, distracted by an interesting wrapper, you can get carried away by the narrative. Indeed, the film was shot well, if we talk about the technical side. There are several interesting plot moves. But overall it's a very very weak film, it's really bad. There is nothing significant, nothing talented behind the exploitation of important topics.",2023-01-13
"There seems to be no limit to what passes for entertainment these days. I almost fell asleep after watching 20 minutes of this turkey waiting for something significant to happen. A woman alone in a spooky house; how original. Only been done a few hundred times before. But the producers want you to believe that this one will be different. It's not. If it had not been a free pass from my friend who is a theater manager, I would not have viewed this junk in the first place, but It was the only film playing at the time that was convenient for me, so I gave it a shot. I would have been better off watching the Minions again in one of the other theaters.",2022-10-06
"There is no possible way that this movie is anywhere in the vicinity of a 7.1. I don't even want to dignify it by explaining why it is bad. There absolutely has to be a campaign to rate it high.It was one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. The beginning was a decent set up. Then it turned into a comedy. There was a renovated house in a neighborhood that looked like a war went through it with a secret door in the basement opened by a giant rope sticking out of the wall that the contractors must've missed.Every character made the wrong choice every time and dropped everything possible in key moments. The plot is filled with holes and unanswered questions. The writing and acting is comical. The effects look to be made by grade schoolers. There is an inbred person with superhuman powers that can survive any blunt force trauma but not gunshot wounds and a main character with no powers that can survive any blunt force trauma AND also gunshot wounds. Every other character cannot survive blunt for trauma nor gunshot wounds. Most get easily ripped apart by the superhuman, night dwelling, malnourished, unwashed, inbred human with her super strength and lactating prosthetic breast glands.I am entertained by good and bad horror movies. I am not entertained by terrible ones. Something is up with the rating on this one.",2022-11-27
"Ok, this thing had a HUGE potential, or so I thought until the last 30 minutes!Oh boy, I really don't know what to say. This is one of the biggest traps I fell into!This thing (I wouldn't even dare to call it a movie!) keeps raising questions and building questions, and all of a sudden, poof, nothing happens!Who books the house??What caused double booking??What are these ""creatures""??How comes that Tess falls first then she's on her back over that creature!What kind of an idiot holds a torch for a few seconds, more than enough to recognize who's in front of him, then ""accidentally"" shoots her!What kind of a moron that gets shot in the belly by an a**hole, then she relaxedly tells him: It's ok it wasn't your fault!Ok, Tess get's shot, looses a lot of blood, no first aid of any kind, falls from the forth floor on her back, then she stands up and walks just like that??What's the whole thing with that town?? Why's it such a wreck??What's that thing with everyone knows about the dangerous creature living in for 4 decades in a property owned by a random a**hole, yet no body does anything about it??All of this is grounded in terrible acting, cringed dialog, no character development, all over the place scenario, zero plausibility, foolish characters decisions, and very unrealistic incidents, just to name a few things gone wrongI understand that this is the director's debut, fine. But where does all this praise come from??RUN AWAY.",2022-10-30
"....be made? Honestly. The point of this whole movie eluded me. It was just a hot mess of cliché's, and not the good ones. Peppered with the Joseph Fritzell story. This movie's story was slower than a frigid atom cloud. And then each time when something was almost happening, it just started all over again. Yeah, no joke. They would just start an entirely new storyline at the exact same speed. Stuff barely happened. The characters aren't likable nor relatable. Like the cops in this movie was just a big joke. No cop in their right mind would ever react like the cops in this movie would. I regret ever having watched this movie all the way trough, but it just goes to prove my 30 minute rule again. If you want this advice, its simple: if nothing has happened right at the 30 minute mark around that, nothing ever will happen in the movie you are watching. I suggest you try it, see me being right every time. Take a look at any movie you ever liked too, when does stuff start to happen? Thats right, the 30 minute mark. You're welcome.",2022-10-26
"Like one of the other reviewers, we were interested at first and it seemed like a regular B movie. Horror movies and B movies can be fun! Unfortunately about an hour into the movie, it devolved into this awful D-level horror movie, with all the standard cliche's and cheap horror movie behaviours.I actually can't believe there were other people who really liked it. I guess that's the level (or complete lack of) intelligence in the movie-making industry we see now. It's getting harder and harder to find something worth watching. What a waste of time this movie is!And this is what we're getting now - boat loads of complete crap in the movie industry.",2023-06-19
"I agree with most of the one star ratings. This movie, without a barbarian anywhere, is the mish mash muck of a disorganized mind. I figured the director/writer, Cregger, must be one of those trust fund offspring of some entertainment biz parents. Nope. So who does he know?!? Who, what investment group could ever willingly fund such a piece of moronic garbage? It's shocking to ponder that such stupidity abounds in the film industry. Maybe they're all strung out on drugs or booze. It's dangerously harmful that maybe a slick poster and a tantalizing trailer could entice people to
lay down cash for this tripe. Was it Covid mania that brought desperate people wanting to escape their memories of the previous 18 months back into the movie houses? Was it desperation to meld as one with the public?? And more alarmingly, what sort of psycho manipulator could convince the industry to fund, actor to take rolls in, and other talented industry types to partner in this crap?Have we all lost our minds?!This film is the biggest POS I've seen in a while. I saw it for free or I'd really be pissed.",2022-11-27
"The actors were OK, and the first half of the movie had potential. But one of my biggest turnoffs is when there are characters who do something that is so unbelievably STUPID that it is inexcusable. This was the case for the lead female, and then the guy who owned the house tried to be even dumber.I was reminded of 'The Quiet place'. When the small child was sacrificed to the monster barely 10 minutes into the movie, I was immediately ready to go home. As a side note - the Detroit police were portrayed as total jerks and unprofessional. I would bet they do not like this film.Some people may like the odd approach to horror, but I wish I would have left before the ending credits!",2022-10-19
"Saw this last year and then I thought it was an awful movie, I decided to watch it again to see if I had changed my outlook, well the quick answer is no.This movie is one mixed up film that doesn't know what it wants to be.It had a lot of promise at the start and until Saskgard gets killed it a very good. Very tense movie but then it all gets thrown into a blender and gets so mixed up it doesn't o is what it wants to do.The main evil character seems like she's bullet proof and seems extra strong by staying in a basement with minimum food and drink, what, I know Thai film gets really stupid.I had read somewhere that this result is from three different scripts, I can see that because each third was different from the previous.An incoherent mess of a movie.",2023-04-28
"First of all, I do not restrict anyone's opinion, but how can a sane person see that this movie is good and that it is worth watching? How does this rubbish get a 7 rating? A stupid movie in every way, the characters always make stupid strange decisions, do you have to make all the characters idiot in order to make a horror movie? A movie full of inconsistencies and plot holes. What provoked me greatly was the scene of falling from the top of the water tower, a scene that goes against the laws of nature and does not convince a young child. A very bad experience and I do not recommend it to anyone.",2022-12-26
"The first half of the movie was very engaging. And let me just point out that the cinematography was some of the best I've seen in recent movies- you get to clearly see what is happening, as well as what's happening in the background at the same time. Camera shots are lined up really well, no shaky cam and don't cut back and forth, which is sorely missing from modern movies especially in the horror genre to build tension. Both actors give excellent performances. Gave this part 8/10.Then the second half of the movie happens. Oh ok, this is different but how does it relate to the first part?? Oh ok I see, I can roll with that. 7/10.But in the last 30 or so minutes, it REALLY falls apart. It's like they didn't really know how to properly build the final act and just threw whatever they could out there. 3/10.It's a movie that I liked and didn't like at the same time. Do I recommend it? Yeah I'd say at check it out for the awesome cinematography and main character.",2023-08-03
"Congratulations. They didn't show much about the movie in the trailer of the movie. This is very good. The movie started very well. The movie is a mystery movie. You are unconfortable, very curious. It goes on, it goes on, and the mystery comes to the surface. Ok so far. Even if there are so many logic errors. Then the movie rolls down the hill. The pace slows towards the end. The finale of the movie is obviously predictable after the mystery is revealed. So after this movie came out, people were divided into two. I liked it, because movies that divide people into loving and hating sides in general intrigued me. I have likes and dislikes. For some reason it seemed to me that I would definitely like the movie. I haven't watched the movie for a long time. I waited. But after watching, my guess was not correct. I didn't like the movie, but I didn't hate it. For me, it was a movie that started well, continued well, but ended with disappointment. In addition, there are a few scenes and decisions in the movie that I was surprised and could not eat these scenes. Frankly, I'm neutral.",2022-12-12
"This starts off promising. Unfortunately, midway through it all falls apart rapidly.It's just yet another 'Horror' film where stupid people do stupid things.These films really get infuriating in all honesty. It is entirely possible to make a horror film where people actually act like real people.There's a bit here, once she manages to escape the house with the help of the homeless guy, all she had to do was burst the door open, or smash a window, get in quickly, get her car keys and get out of there. Instead, we're subjected to a truly infuriating scene where she walks to a petrol station, phones the Police who duly arrive and presume she's a junky. Did she tell them that her I. D. and car were at the property? No. She states she doesn't have I. D.
Once they get to the property, she still doesn't point out that the Jeep is her car and that the keys are on the table inside the house. She doesn't give them her name in order to cross check the registration to prove she's telling them the truth. Not only that, but the Police must clearly see the two cars parked outside the property, and maybe think her story might just add up.It's lazy writing with clearly nowhere near enough thought put into it. It would be possible to create the same storyline but with characters who think like intelligent people. This constant lazy writing that we get subjected to is ruining what could otherwise be very good films.",2022-11-02
I was looking forward for barbarian for a long time to start in Germany. But now my disappointment is huge. How many plotholes can a single movie have?***SPOILERS***Why does this woman even live down there? Why is she watching a TV show about kids? Why is she treating the intruders as her kids? What the hell is the other guy doing down there in his bed and why did he commit suicide? How could they rent a house that was not beeing rented in the last month?Maybe i just didnt understand what the director wants to tell me.But in my opinion this is just a bad movie that doesnt make any sense for me.

"So the previews intrigued me enough to want to check this movie out, however red flag after red flag were quickly raised while watching this to the point where I said this is really dumb!Let's start with a Hollywood celeb who's originally from Michigan owning air B&B properties in a run down area of Detroit.The neighborhood looks like a dilapidated war zone, and one nicely kept house in the middle of it all, and someone would stay there??Then there's the whole situation with what's going on in the basement. Totally ridiculous even though the first time you see the woman it is kinda frightening, which quickly gives way to this is so dumb.The ending just sums up the ridiculousness of the entire film.If you have an hour or so to waste, go for it I guess.",2023-06-17
"BARBARIAN (C) has an incredibly simple and freaky and effective setup: what if you arrived at night at your AirBnB or Vrbo only to discover it was double-booked and the house might not be everything you thought it was? I won't say more because much of the substance of the movie is in the reveal of what comes next. My view is that once the reveal happens, I just didn't care for the direction and kept becoming increasingly frustrated with there the movie went. I don't think the reset and re-intro works that well. I also don't think a key decision by authority figures later made any sense. In the end I don't think it's theme on women/men is all that insightful or helpful. A promising horror movie that never delivered for me. Overrated, not that insightful, and full of shock for shock sake.",2023-02-26

No one would make these decisions.So nope. We peaced out on this movie about 30 minutes in. And I have no regrets. I read more reviews to get some spoilers and I'm at peace with this decision.Y'all can keep on saying it's intense and we'll structured and great acting. Nope.It's pure nonsense.

"The premise was really strong and interesting. It looked like it was gonna be one of my favorite horror films in recent times. The acting was good, the characters were good, but the film fell off a cliff after the monster reveal. It became a comedy. The monsters were scarier when we couldn't see them. After the reveal I couldn't take them seriously.The characters who were competent at the beginning started to make the dumb decision horror trope. I stopped rooting for them to escape and I didn't care if they got offed. This completely dissolved the tension of the film for me.So many horror films have a great setup but the writers do not know how to pay it off. This is one of those films.",2023-09-15
"Mike Tyson is fond of saying ""Everybody has a plan...until they get punched in the face,"" How does that apply to horror? Well, generally all the characters have a plan (normal comportment) until they are thrust fully into ""the horror""- at which point- survival mode takes over. Unfortunately, in much of modern horror it seems the same thing applies to the scriptwriters. This film, like so many others, has a fairly well written beginning that lasts pretty much until the girl discovers the room with the camera (if the door had only closed behind her at that point and the screen had gone to black- what a great short horror film THAT would have made) the following confrontation with the beta male room mate was pretty good , too. Once, however, the whatever it was, makes its first appearance the writers are the ones who go into survival mode. The film falls apart in a panicky incoherence with a flashback to the 80's and some pseudo-science that should make you laugh out loud (a child born in the 80's that has an inbred child in say 1995 would not produce the kind of monstrosity seen here) . The last twenty to thirty minutes is painful and totally forgettable.Two asides: 1) these kids today NEVER don't have their phones with them- they're surgically attached to their hands. 2) the old man and the monster would have moved out of Detroit long ago it's too damn dangerous there.",2023-01-15
"The concept of staying in a creepy airbnb house was brilliant! The first act of the film is pretty good. The story is great, the atmosphere is interesting and the acting is decent. But suddenly half way through the plot everything changes. It is as if the second half of the movie was written by a differnt person. The plot becomes silly, the actors' reactions and dialogues become silly too, the scares become predictable and the movie turns into a bad sci fi. Everything becomes so fake in the second half and the whole atmosphere is ruined. What started with potential to be a great horror - mystery movie ultimately turned into a mess. It is a pity really..",2023-02-07
When I saw the reviews calling this piece of .... A cult i was expecting at least an interesting film. Well it builds up with nothing happening 30-40 minutes then just a piece of action 15-20 minutes then a meaningless flash back for 20 minutes taking you to a ridiculous finale! If you are really board and looking for something to watch go find a window and watch people & cars because it would be less wasting your time.And if you really need to watch something scary even Friday the 13th number 8 is better than this disgusting thing.Possibly people gave this a high rate and calling this a cult must be the production team!,2022-11-20
"Horror films that require their characters to do the dumbest thing possible over and over again to make the movie keep moving are not horror movies, their idiot flicks.Nothing about this movie is even marginally scary unless you have been hit in the head with a sledgehammer in the last week.The high ratings on this film are most likely paid for because this film is honestly really awful. Just cliche stupidity all the way through.I imagine part of the problem is that it's impossible to write characters that are more intelligent than the writer. Not much else can explain just how pointless and stupid this movie is.",2022-12-08
"Can't believe in 2022 there is still some producer that believes such garbage worth his money. The plot is so stupid, bad written and the characters are dumb as hell. The big problem of horror movies, specially american ones, is that they are thought for a teenage audience. If you are 10 years old you probably can feel something, but you have to be sure of having not seen any other thriller/horror. Otherwise this will sound to you derivative. Really embarrassed for the writer/director. Maybe the good reviews on social media are bought? Hope so, otherwise I can drop all of my faith about the horror audience being made of particularly clever people.",2022-11-09
"I noticed the reviews are good enough so I had to this hopefully through word of mouth this gets plenty of recognition BARBARIAN is that movie that is a must watch! I was on the fence about seeing it because I didn't know much about it. This horror film's trailer does an amazing job at being vague enough to pique your interest. Notice how I'm not mentioning the plot at all? Yeah, the less you know about BARBARIAN the better it will be.I will say that this movie takes the most unexpected turns, not giving me any hint or notion of where the hell it's going. There aren't too many jump-scares in this one; I hate when they're overdone. I think word of mouth will eventually benefit this movie, and I'm so happy filmmakers can still keep me guessing. If I had to sum this up in 5 words, they would be scary, bat-s h I t crazy, and amazing. Best horror film this year so far.",2022-09-14
"I wanted to like this more than I did.The people behind this movie obviously put a lot of heart into it and had fun doing it.The build up is very tentative allowing you to get a good feel for the characters.I generally appreciate this approach and it works well here and although you have to be patient and sit quietly whilst some pretty mundane stuff goes on it does build up some tension.As with a lot of horror movies when the action starts there is a big flash of excitement followed by some running around waving hands in the air.The action section just doesn't feel like it justified the extended build up.The horror element is kind of goofy, not really scary and is over in a flash.If you remove the fluff regarding the main characters then this film is very short.If you are into your horror films then this is a solid enough and there is fun to have but I wasn't particularly impressed.",2022-12-16

"What happens when an attractive young documentary film researcher stumbles into the horror genre?You get an acid vision of post-Reagan America. We are, after all, experiencing the America that grew out of the Reagan trickle-down economics and bubble-up right-wing populism. The film's title is a concise summary.As we see, the monster's father stayed in the ostensibly proper Detroit suburb when civilization left. In a clash of elements an Air BnB now conceals - and feeds - an underground horror chamber where the ideal of nursing motherhood has turned monstrous. The monster stalks the night - and the rental above- for prisoners she can force into being her sucklings. As she kills the non-obliging, her parody of nursing does keep at least Tess alive.In the final irony, the end titles play against the '50s rock classic Be My Baby. That romantic anthem has become a monster's fatal compulsion. Indeed the female monster is a bitter amplification of the imprisoned wife in Jane Eyre, the novel discovered in a tenant's suitcase.The documentary context extends from heroine Tess's responsible profession down to the porn studio in the cavern. The monster supplies her now helpless old father with videos of the prisoners they have tortured - presumably starting with the housewife we see him setting up for abduction. In contrast, in Tess's new project a woman filmmaker covers the reclaiming of abandoned properties- whether neighbourhoods or values.Once confronted with a normal man - the TV producer AJ - the monster's father kills himself. But how ""normal"" is AJ?As the plot's ostensible hero he is totally compromised. He's the absentee and oblivious owner of the property now so poisoned. He has come to liquidate it in order to pay his legal charges to defend against a rape charge. As he describes the incident to a buddy and as he indiscreetly tells the woman's answering machine, she has a strong case. As the monster is a perversion of motherhood AJ is a perversion of romantic manhood.He even fails as the film's ""hero,"" despite his part in freeing Tess. While his shooting her may be accidental, he instinctively sacrifices Tess to deflect the monster, to save himself. As befits such a film-centered hero AJ has his eyes gouged out.The monster's female nature may be unusual, but the sexual threat is largely accorded the male: from the monster's father down to the rapist AJ. She is the product of her father's rapes. Indeed the threatening atmosphere is so sexual that in his first scenes with Tess Keith may well be innocent. But the scene ripples with sexual danger. His nightmares and her mysteriously opening doors catch the danger in their minds - and in the underground of their world.With these themes and strategy this is a contemporary take on the classic horror genre, extremely polished and effective.",2022-10-31
"""Barbarian"" is a pretty forgettable horror flick about strangers in a house they don't know has inhabited catacombs beneath it.The image of a nude villainous elderly woman, and the scene where the female protagonist finds out she isn't alone in the house, reminded me of ""The Shining"". The vintage pop song that played over the end credits reminded me also of ""Midsommar"". Unfortunately, the comparisons that these call-backs encouraged were unflattering, as ""Barbarian"" isn't nearly as good as either movie.The plot is unnecessarily complicated, with too many characters, and completely unnecessary flashbacks. I often found myself wondering how it was possible that mineshafts could exist under this house, and that someone could buy the house and not know of their existence. Of course, all movies have unlikely scenarios like this, but it's the job of the filmmakers to stop you from wondering. ""Barbarian"" had so much dead air I couldn't help myself.The set-up is too realistic for such a silly premise. Two people book an Air B'n'B in the same house, and end up having to stay together. There is some awkwardness between them at first and we are led to believe one of the two may be a villain. The man is more strongly implicated, but this doesn't go anywhere. It's the stuff of relatable modern horror, but the movie is really just a story that could have been used as a b-horror flick in the eighties.I was intrigued by the appearance of a character who gets #MeToo'd but is still represented as being somewhat likeable. I thought that that at least showed guts. He could have been redeemed by the film's end. Then the movie cops out with him at the end. At least he got a pretty good death scene - in fact, the only one in the movie.",2022-11-27
"I gave the movie a 5, to help bring down the score, but I think it belongs somewhere in the 6.5 range.It has too many qualities to dismiss.Barbarian is all about build-up, and the first half of the movie is quite tense and stylish. What the hell is going on here? Who are these people and what's happening to them? The movie does a great job at setting up these characters and creating tension.But creating a satisfying final act is more difficult than proper build-up. And it seems as if the filmmakers had no clue where to go with this story. Not to spoil anything, but the movie just works to a rediculous and obvious reveal and climax. It's just not worth it, and the second half of the movie didn't deserve the first 42 minutes, as good as they were. The 1 hour 42 minutes movie is really two different movies put together.I love some of the concepts that the movie plays with, but it has been done much better in other movies. Movies like The People Under The Stairs and Don't Breathe.",2022-10-29
"Georgina Campbell travels to Detroit for a job interview and finds out that the little house she booked on Airbnb is already occupied by Bill Skarsgård. It seems he also booked it via a different service, but since it's raining and the middle of the night, they agree to share it for at least one night.This is a pretty damn good horror film. It uses Skarsgård's presence and status as Pennywise to lead you down the road of suspecting him, no matter how unbelievably nice he seems, only to completely pull the rug out and reveal a very different threat.It then cuts to Justin Long, an actor sitting on the verge of starring in a new sitcom, only to find out he's been accused of sexually assaulting his co-star. The film gets him to the Airbnb (by a pretty logical chain of events) and gets a lot of mileage out of Long's ability to keep you guessing by teetering on the edge of awfulness.This isn't a perfect film. It asks you to accept some fairly implausible stuff to drive the plot along, but it also ratchets up the tension enough that I was willing to go with it.",2022-09-15
"Takes it's time and has a massive second act hook that absolutely changes the film, really a huge sucker punch with absurd comedy. It's baffling at times, absolutely insane and there isn't another film you're going to see like it for years. The craziest horror theater experience I've had since Tusk. It's dark, it's funny, it's shocking. Could not recommend a film more, go see it while it's still in theaters to see with a crowd and hear their reactions.GO IN BLIND AND DO NOT WATCH TRAILERS!!! You deserve to experience this wildness for yourself. It's also shot beautifully and the performances all are pitch perfect for the scenes they are in. Justin Long is a blessing and we do not deserve him.",2022-09-07
"That's the first thing I texted my girlfriend after watching Barbarian. I understand horror movies have to have a certain amount of human error and dumb character choices to substantiate the plot, but wow, this movie really overdid it. The amount of fumbling hands dropping items in key moments, going from casual to terrified in such a stark and comical way, is excruciating to watch. There comes a point where you can't relate to the protagonists anymore because they don't behave like any normal human being would. The gory scenes were hilariously fake, eg, the limb-breaking and eye-gauging enucleation... if you're going to do zoom shots of such acts at least get some better work done on the effects. The plot circumvents back to mother's past at some point but never really follows through with more detail, and plenty of scenes are dragged out unnecessarily, just making the whole ordeal of getting through this movie more painful. I'll give some credit where it's due and throw some stars in for some nice camera work and music selection, and I'd like to think the actors did a good job despite forced to play such unnatural characters in unnatural circumstances.",2022-11-26
"Alright, let's start off with this absolute rollercoaster of a movie. The first 40 mins of the movie are pure perfection, it's absolutely what anyone can ask for in a horror/thriller movie and I don't even watch a horror movie that much. The whole time it portrays that Keith is gonna be the madman or a kidnapper or whatever you think of it cause it's the direction the movie is taking you in and it's good. The whole time you're trying to figure out like what's next, it keeps you on the edge of your seat and makes you question everything. But then, halfway through the movie, it's as if the writer was swapped and it just goes down horribly. Like I can't express how bad it goes on from there and frankly, there were no more horror elements to it. It just turns into one of those cliche hiding and chasing from a weird creature that makes you say ""wtf"" the whole time. I can't wrap my head around how this title got 7 out of 10 by the majority. The people who enjoyed this crap probably have never seen a good horror movie in their life. Overall, it's sad that the trailer built soooo much hype and the beginning was absolutely spot on but then NAHHH that aint it.Also, wtf is Barbarian? Trust me you wouldn't know what or who the Barbarian is even after watching the movie.Save yourself the trouble and watch something worth the time and what you pay for.",2023-06-02
"The first 40 minutes consist of some of the best suspense build up I've seen on film in a very long time.

Those first 40 minutes set you up to expect the ""big reveal"", the great turning point that will let all hell break lose, and then... That's it?! Are you serious?! I followed a friend's advice and went in on this one knowing absolutely nothing, so I had no idea what to expect. Then those 40 friggin' minutes get me all electrified with so much expectation and the movie is about... THAT? Seriously, I can't praise those first 40 minutes enough, they're really amazing and the sole deserving moments that made me give this movie a 5/10. What comes next is as disappointing as what came before was exciting.",2022-12-06
"Firstly, this is not the revolutionary edge of your seat thrilling horror some people are saying.Theres a a couple jumpy moments, and a couple of gory ones, both very minimal.The main selling point i think is meant to be the plot, and how it tries to make you think one thing and then something completely different happens, which happens a couple of times, and was nice and different to most other movies.But essentially what you get is a silly story that makes completely no sense, and it doesn't even try to, the idea was to surprise you with it, i think, not for you to be impressed with it. And if that is the case then it worked.If your a horror fan and will watch anything in the genre, for sure it's a good watch, if your watching because you believe in some of the reviews its revolutionary.. you will be disappointed.",2022-10-28
"Seriously, modern horror is rubbish going by this.The characters are written awfully, the premise is just waffle and the antagonist is laughable. A waste of nearly 2 hours. How this won an award I don't know.I genuinely hoped the leads died. O mean, are people in the States that naive, shallow and nauseating? Thus resulting in film makers drawing on the intellect (or lack there of) and thought processes of those within their society? ""We need to get 2 people in a house""""Let's have them double book an air bnb because if that happened in the real world, they'd happily share the place for one night""It's not even convoluted because would take actual thought. Just outright lazy.The scariest thing is, I'd seen high praise for this movie.",2023-01-10
"To be completely honest I don't write a lot of reviews for films because what is there to say that others haven't. But, this one I am passionately angry about. I am not a typical horror film person so, I tend to not watch or watch years down the road. This was the first one in a long time that I had decided to see in theaters. First bad decision. The second? Thinking this movie gets any better. I'll give it to them... in the beginning this movie had me by the throat. The plot was good. The suspense was even better. I was so ready to see where they took it. Never been more disappointed. Not only do they completely shift characters to an absolute garbage story line might I add but they also just leave complete holes in the story that never get answered. They state the girl isn't the worst thing down there insinuating there is more or at least something scarier then the incest daughter that is incredibly hard to kill but also insanely easy to kill? None of it makes sense. When it ended I genuinely was shocked because I felt as if I got nothing from that movie in the end. Especially after such a good start. What a true disappointment and for somebody that's easily scared this is almost offensive to call this horror. Don't waste your money.",2022-09-10
"I wanted to see a horror movie. Watched on rating. 7.2/10. Damn that's pretty good for a horror movie. Usually if it gets atleast 5/10 it's watchable. Downloaded it. Watched first 30 mins looked creepy and scary. And then it started to go downhill... They spent useless 20 mins from the movie showing useless scenes and they didn't even explained why that happened what happened... People dumb as fk as always, but that's horror movies. People are dumb in theese movie all the time. Ending was horrible. I wanted to see more. After 30 mins of watching. This movie felt like a comedy not a horror movie. Im not saying that i didn't like it. But it is overrated for sure. Did we watched the same movie, who gives this an 8?",2022-11-03
"This movie is plagued with plot twists. At first we're presented with two characters, that's what makes you guess which one is the bad guy? Cause in every horror movie, there's always a bad guy. Maybe the nice guy was secretly a serial killer? Maybe the female protagonist was the actual serial killer? Nope! You're wrong! Cause before you're done making your final guess, another twist is coming! I'm trying hard not spoiling the movie for those who's reading this review. I'll just give you all a hint : whenever you think you've got the mystery figured out or the outcome, you're gonna get hit by another plot twist. So I suggest you just go with the flow and enjoy the horror.",2022-11-02
"I really didn't expect much, but this movie was really good. I thought it was an obvious formula, but nope, tricked me. I don't like murder and gore, but this movie was just the perfect mix of horror, fun, good script tension etc... to be really enjoyable and not leave me feeling like I wanted a shower after it ended.For what I think was a a low-budget, indie film, there were no moments that were amateurish or poorly directed / acted to pull you out of the story. Everything was damn good enough. The writing was good, the story was fresh enough, the acting was good, everything was good and it was consistent from start to finish.Even if you don't like horror usually, this movie is still enjoyable and a good time. I recommend it.",2022-11-02
There wasn't one part of the movie that was good. Started out slow and pretty much stayed that way. Can they really make a scary movie anymore? This was a joke.Starts slow and really doesn't pick up the pace. There really isn't a good story line and only one character twist in the plot. So over simplified and so simple that I don't see how it was even given a budget to make this film.I managed to stay through the whole movie but the theatre I was in had multiple leave about 45 minutes in. I thought about leaving but I thought I had to see where this was going.When an entire theatre of people laugh out loud you know it's not scary.Don't waste your time.,2022-09-18
"Why is it so hard, Hollywood?!?! Why can't you make a horror movie these days? Nope, Black Phone, Orphan 2, Bodies, Bodies, Bodies; none of those are legitimate horror movies. They're also all bad, but that's besides the point. Barbarian finally gives 2022 something to scream about!Any time someone goes into the tunnels, you don't know what's gonna pop out or happen. The movie does a great job of building tension, but more importantly it delivers on the build up with something happening almost every time.Barbarian does have its flaws. The characters do some REALLY stupid things, borderline unforgivable decision-making. There's also a really bad scene with some cops.Overall, the movie's greatest strengths are the cinematography and music, which really makes the atmosphere and tension of this movie creepy. All the actors were dynamite as well. There were also some surprisingly hilarious moments sprinkled throughout.If you like Don't Breathe or The Descent, then I'd recommend this movie as it is kind of a mish-mash of both those.7.3/10.",2022-09-09
"No pun intended - and while he only has a minor screen presence .... his presence is felt throughout ... again no pun intended. If you read anything about this movie - even some short two sentences - I would argue it reveals too much! Not having read anything, I was able to enjoy this completely free of any thoughts and preconception I might have had otherwise.The way it starts with our main character coming in ... it is as eerie as it gets. The sound the framing ... there is horror in it ... and nothing has happened yet! But we expect something to happen .. every frame, every movement ... every sound ... so well orchestrated! And the acting is top notch too.The movie also leaves out certain bits that other movies would relish in ... but we can fill in the blanks (again no pun intended). I am happy for that - it would be almost unbearable to watch. And we know what is happening ... we do not need to see it. There are hard cuts, there are ""jumps"" from one thing/scene to another. We may need a second to adjust ... we may have to accept certain things and how they are portrayed. But than there also is the casting ... people play their parts great.Sympathy or not - we have expectations. The question is if they are met ... and how they are met. One thing is true for this as for most if not all horror movies: you have to suspend your disbelief! Certain characters act (no pun here) a certain way ... which you probably will not agree with. But considering the expectations, the way people talked about this online ... the hype to sum it up this had already created ... it really works.",2022-12-31
"Watched it just tonight... Was expecting something different, but wanted to experience for the story. Well... The atmosphere and tension building is great, we have good cast, nice cinematography and okay sound design. The problem starts with the decisions of the characters and almost everyone else. Maybe the main villain is the most sensible in the whole movie. Painfully idiotic characters, who you will never root for, because they just... Literally lining up to die. But lets say that its necessary in order to keep the story going... We have tension in the beginning, but completely nothing in the end. Everything is just predictable and empty. Comedic/ironic timing is there, but why? The big reveals (two) are just weak with no real impact on the audience. The movies world feels like a villain on its own... Everybody is somehow contributing to the killings and just acts in an unbelievable and unrealistic way.The villain is a monster obviously, but somehow does not feel scary. It got two creepy scenes in the whole movie for seconds and then even that is destroyed by the over the top and ridiculous segments...
(SPOILER: Killing someone with his own ripped off arm is funny, but unnecessary... And then at the end, the jumping scene wanted to be emotional and sad, yet ended up extremely hilarious and took me out of the movie.)The movie is just average or below average for a seasoned horror enjoyer, which is sad, because with some fresh ideas, it could have been so much better.I was disappointed at the end.",2023-04-28
"What started out as a very promising movie led to one of the most disappointing, overly hyped comedy, instead of being the amazing horror movie everyone claims it is.Every singly actor, including the monster, makes the weirdest and dumbest decisions no one in real life will ever make. They started the movie really being self aware that everything thats happening would seem suspicious for the normal human being, but then decided to throw it all out the window and every character started to make unrealistic decisions that lead to their demise.Like the house, you should stay from this movie!!",2022-10-29
"Another blatant proof that ratings aren't worth anything nowadays. But seeing the rating and a halfway interesting trailer i gave it a chance.. stupid characters, stupid story, umbelieveable and mostly boring, this mess has nothing redeemable.Not one action of the characters makes sense, is believeable or realistic.Of course everyone is exploring the dark dungeon under the rent home on it's own.. alone. But ya, in a world where the police doesnt care either it kinda makes sense.Would i have known Peele had his dirty paws in it i probably would have skipped the movie and saved my time.Stay away from this crapfeast - dont believe bought ratings.",2022-10-30
"Wow, I cannot believe the hype this movie got. I didn't care about any of the characters besides one who gets killed during a gag joke near the end. Story was so predictable and gave us empty reasons to hate characters. There is also some stupid slapstick stuff in it that makes no sense in the moment.Also I usually don't mind social justice messages in movies, but this one forces them for no reason and it makes the plot super predictable. They take one or two scenes to paint a trope of a terrible misogynist rapist guy with no redeeming qualities and then expect us to fill in the rest. This is two entire characters!!!Just an awful movie from start to finish. Don't waste your time.",2022-11-27
"There was nothing even a little bit subtle about this film. Everything it has to say, it says six times a scene while smacking you in the face and screaming ""get it???""The first act was fine. Creepy and tense enough that I was along for the ride even when at times it was a little too on the nose in attempts to set up an uncomfortable situation. The rest of the movie ditches that vibe entirely, changes pace in a way that it can't really handle, and incorrectly assumes that if something is gross it is automatically scary.I really, truly did not enjoy this movie. I'm a pretty forgiving audience member, especially for a horror movie. A movie that's not super scary but is clever or interesting? Cool. A movie that's pretty stupid but still fun? Great. This was not scary, clever, or fun. And I honestly don't get what was supposed to be surprising/wild about this. The ""twists"" were pretty standard horror fare, but done in a way that felt almost condescending. It felt like a horror movie that was at least in part *about* horror movies in that meta/genre savvy way, but made by people who do not love horror movies.",2022-09-19
"I looked forward to this movie due to rave reviews. If you're looking for anything ""high brow"" or different, don't hold your breath. It's as formulaic as it gets. I'd consider this a B rated horror movie with a Hollywood budget. The misdirection is welcomed, but the plot is all over the place. There's so many questions left unanswered. Characters have no arcs and continue to lack common sense (including secondary characters). My main point of contention is one of the main leads. To be frank: he's a god awful character and of course, he's on-screen for 75% of the movie.Scenes (especially in the beginning) feel excruciatingly LONG. It's further exacerbated with terrible cuts. The story's finally picking up? Oh well...time for a jump cut that won't be relevant till 20 minutes from now. To say it kills the atmosphere is an understatement. The movie was only 1 hr 45 mins but felt like atleast 2 hrs 30 mins. Despite reading other reviews, I still don't get why people like this movie so much. I forgot it already, and it's only been 30 minutes.Also if someone could mention how the title is relevant to the film, that'd be great too.",2022-09-16
"This movie was terrible. I don't have words to say how bad it was. One of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. It began pretty good, but when we're advancing in the story, it didn't make any sense at all.I felt like they changed the writer during the filming of this movie because it's like two different movies: one intriguing and mysterious movie in which we want to know what's happening and after that, it's a piece of garbage with unnecessary violence and cringe and disgusting moments.I don't recommend this movie for anyone that, like me, like horror movies, but with a minimum of content and logic and continuity.",2022-12-11
"Went in to this one blind other than looking it up on IMBD. I had high hopes going into this one, but what a disappointment. The audience and citric ratings were some of the highest I've seen in the horror genre lately, and I do not know why.The movie was not scary, the gore (or lack there of) was poorly done. There was some comedic moments that almost reminded me of Evil Dead, but I don't know if that was intentional. The storyline was very lacklustre, and should have been spent a bit more on developing characters. The movie definitely should have elaborated more on the flashback. 3/10 not good!",2023-03-15
"First halve of this film plays like a Norman Bates-esque suspense, centered around two people who are seemingly double-booked in the same house through an online rental-service, and are forced to spend the night together.Then, around the 45 minute mark, movie shifts and become something else entirely, introducing new characters, and themes, and the seriousness is replaced with a satirical tone, or rather straight up goofball.It's really odd. Because of this, it succeeds not as a horror, and not quite as a satire. It's not scary, truth. Absolutely nothing new to be had here. I heard great things about it, and so I watched it with anticipation, but ultimately just a huge, cliched, and scrambled mess of a movie.Gore is 5/10
Movie is 5.5/10.",2023-01-05
"Greetings from Lithuania.""Barbarian"" (2022), without going into any spoilers, is a very simple story uniquely told. I already saw this type of story, its nothing original, but the strength of ""Barbarian"" lies in its storytelling. And there any way more then one strength that ""Barbarian"" has an what makes its such an enjoyable movie to watch. Acting was terrific by all involved. But its directing and writing that made this movie step above the material. Its also a bloody movie, and scary when it needs to be scary.Overall, ""Barbarian"" is simple horror story done right. At running time 1 h 52 min i was involved into this movie from its opening scene till last frame. Directing was masterful as well superb acting. What a great horror movie.",2022-12-11
"While you could say every movie benefits from going into it knowing very little information about it, that statement applies to some films even more than most. Barbarian is one of those movies. It takes some wild turns, and the most you should know going into it is that it's a horror film (a no-go genre for some people), and that the set-up involves a young woman showing up at an Airbnb, only to find someone else is already there. From there, things go in numerous strange directions, and the less known about them the better.It's a horror thriller that yanks you around a bunch. Sometimes, it's very unsettling; mostly in its quieter, more suspenseful moments. When it goes big and loud, it gets less scary, but becomes kind of fun in an over-the-top way. Some of this movie felt really funny too, even if I couldn't ever call it a ""comedy"" strictly speaking. Honestly, it's a shame there were only six people in the cinema I saw it at. I think this would benefit from being seen with as big a crowd as possible.The variety of tones and different genres Barbarian taps into sometimes make it feel messy. After watching it, I wasn't quite sure whether it balanced them masterfully or just threw random things around, hoping they'd stick (particularly near the kind of ridiculous climax). It's unhinged and all over the place, but I think it does so in a way that works... for the most part. I am also pretty sure I'd know better if I watched this again. I think I'd come out of a second viewing thinking it was much better or much worse than I initially thought.So for now, I'm mostly positive about it. If you don't mind horror movies (especially ones with lots of darkness, claustrophobia, and jump scares) I'd recommend it highly. If I said any more, it would be saying too much. Even if it's messy and silly at times, I admire the ambition of this horror movie, I liked how it was consistently entertaining, and enjoyed the unpredictable narrative. Good stuff, overall.",2022-10-26
I enjoyed the movie until the most annoying part where the police wouldn't even entertain the possibility that the woman could have been telling the truth. I know it is all fiction but the way the police acted toward the main character did nothing but make me rolls my eyes in annoyance & decide to not finish the movie. The police scene just should never have been a part of the movie at all. If not for that I would have most likely finished the movie. Instead I read about how the rest of the movie went online. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Just very frustrating and a complete waste of time.,2022-10-29
"The first half of this movie is like a different film entirely. It's really interesting, atmospheric, creepy, and tense, in fact the sound editing is fantastic. Then there's a kind of twist and the second half is actually the worst movie I've ever seen, and isn't even scary at all. I'm absolutely shocked that the same person wrote and directed both halves of this movie, I feel like I got tricked. It starts out like very grounded in reality and then the ""twist"" just devolves the plot into some subpar gross horror schlock. This movie is terrible, I can't emphasize enough how bad it was to watch it and have it just get worse and worse and dumber and dumber.",2022-09-10
"This looked like it was going in a very good direction until AJ comes into the mix. The actor did a great job to add comedic relief BUT there is just Soooo much going on in this movie. Also, who is Marcus who phones at the start?It just boils down to the Old guy being a creep who used to take women & trap them fritzel style... Why does he kill himself? Does he regret what he did or...?Who is the homeless guy? Mentions living there for 15 years and getting No Bother until he brings the ONLY 2 people who have escaped in ALL of those years and the lady comes in and literally beats him to death with his own Arm!Where does the title Barbarian come from?",2022-12-16
"This is like about three movies glued together, and they get worse as they go. Starts off well enough but when they drop a big reveal pretty early and there's still over an hour to go you know it's going to either be really good or really bad. Sadly it's the latter.It borrows from other, better horror movies and spends way too much time with people slowly wandering along dark tunnels. The plot doesn't pay off, could have been much better. Turns out it's just weirdos living in tunnels, nothing more. And the lead character makes the classic stupid decisions of horror movie cliche. After being trapped for ages, the first thing she wants to do after escaping is go back in.Ending is dull too, overall could have been much better with a better script.",2023-06-16
"I really wanted to love this movie. I love non-fantastical realistic horror movies, like the original Wrong Turn and the original Texas Chainsaw! However implausible those movies were, they were possible at least. This movie was totally possible, until the final act. That's where it goes off the rails into the fantastical and becomes an entirely different TYPE of movie. Some movies are better when more is left to the imagination, but doing so in this movie just makes it unbelievable. If the ending was a little more realistic, then it quite possibly could have reached the classic heights of Wrong Turn or Chainsaw. Or, it should have gone more fantastical. It just felt like two different types of horror movies to me. I still gave it 6 stars because I actually enjoyed it; the acting was great, it was well made in all aspects, and I look forward to what this director makes next. It just didn't stick the landing for me. Too unrealistic at the end for what it seemed to be trying to be....",2022-09-26
"I don't know why this movie has many great ratings lol. My cousin and I were waiting MONTHS for this to come out, the first part of the movie was great we both had our thoughts on what was gonna happen and we're so excited to see those thoughts play out. Yet to our displeasure this movie was weird..like a very bad weird lol. One of the worst concepts for a movie I've ever seen. If you wanna watch a weird creature with big ole saggy titties capturing people to be their ""mommy"" while she makes them suck on her breasts then this movie is for you. I rather watch the horror movie with that giant fly lmao. Absolutely horrible.",2022-10-30
"There's a term in British English, ""a curate's egg"" which is to say ""good in parts"" implying some parts are less than good. 2022's movie, Barbarian is a curate's egg. And then some. In fact it is a rare achievement as it manages to be absolute garbage and totally brilliant simultaneously. First the bad; the set up is completely proposterous. The movie asks us to believe some truly astounding failures in narrative logic which lands the young lady protagonist in a situation which starts off bad and progressively becomes worse. She has numerous opportunities to escape but rather than doing so she runs headlong back into mortal danger. I know it's a horror movie trope that young women senselessly place themselves in peril but Barbarian multiplies that to the Nth degree. Then there's the nature of the peril in question. What can I say other than it's completely unimaginable and totally implausible. There's a brief set up but this doesn't begin to explain the situation or motivation. Now to the good. Barbarian is scarry AF. The plot continuously twists and turns the viewer's expectations so they never really know what's going on and as we all know true fear comes from the unknown. There's some recognisable actors who do a reasonable job and the production values are respectable for a movie of this sort. If not for some huge plot holes near the beginning, Barbarian could've been a horror classic but as it stands it's only average.",2022-10-28
"So, for starters, people who seem to be somewhat wealthy, would never stay in an Airbnb in a neighborhood where all the houses on the street besides the Airbnb are boarded up. I am not overly wealthy, and I would simply have turned around and driven away and never looked back. Instead, these people not only stay, they go exploring into the dark underground secret rooms in the basement. We are led to believe that a man was keeping women down there, raping them, and having multiple children with them however, we only see one man and one woman we have no idea if this is one of the children one of the women he kept down there or what she is but she has superhuman power which makes no sense. This could've been really great movie if they would've just expanded on what the hell was going on in those underground rooms but we're left with only seeing two of them and one immediately killed himself, so no explanation there. Where are all these other women and babies at? Who invests in these movies? Does anyone proofread these things or watch it before it is released? Honestly, I think high schoolers could make better movies then some of these things that they are making nowadays. And shame on the obviously paid shills that are giving this thing good reviews.",2023-09-10
"...and the result was so so.It's hard to describe this movie without spoiling any value the twist in it have so bare with me.One thing about this movie is that when I first watched it I felt very bored. It took me about 4 days or so to sit down and commit to watching through the first 20 minutes. The story starts out really slow and uninteresting. Slow horror building up is fine except in this movie is made to provide misdirection and nothing else.By the time you get to the decent part of the film the movie is practically over and you sort of wonder as to why they didn't put more time developing the better parts of the story.The movie starts out with a young woman who is renting an Air B&B for some sort of interview she's going on. She meets a guy who is somehow also staying there in a fluke at the same time. Is he a good guy or a bad guy? He acts creepy as the two get to know each other.Then the story switches into darker territory and you realize things aren't what they seem. Then it switches again into a light hearted comedy almost and then back into a horror film.I also feel like there's some sort of moral story going on in the background but it just seems to be a horror movie around men that prey on vulnerable women and it unfolds in various ways.Now is it entertaining? I guess but it's also forgettable. As you watch the movie you realize that there are more interesting aspects of the horror portion of the story that should have gotten more screentime and instead it had the fat trimmed from it and just didn't seem as flavorful afterwards.This movie also has one of those non conclusive endings which is extremely annoying as you're left to wonder how things resolved themselves.I would recommend this movie as a warm up to watch if your 2nd movie is a better choice. This movie is too discombobulated to be satisfying as a horror movie. It has so many different directions it's told in and none of them fit well together or should I say the constant shifting and mode changing doesn't fit well together.It ends up not being scary or a horror movie and something more like ""The Goonies"" in the end.",2023-06-05
"This movie seems promising at the beginning but as it goes on, it gets many nonsense moments and bad writing/production choices.The first act is pretty well written: creepy and mysterious since the first frame (even though the two characters are not very interesting) and when the creature arrives and kills Keith (Bill Skarsgård), it makes you believe it's gonna be a good film.But the problems start now: as long as we get more into the story in the second act we would like to know more about characters background but that never happens.Just a few bits of explanation about who they are and where they come from.We know nothing about AJ, except the fact he's been sued by that fellow actress and he needs to sell the house but there is no indications in the previous hour of the film that he's the owner, it seems they just needed an excuse to throw him in.We understand Tess (Georgina Campbell) is in Detroit for a job interview so she needs a place to stay for the night but... there is no rooms in the whole city so she had to book a house in the worst block of the world?What about the B&B agency? They rent a house to two different people, they disappear and they never wonder where they are? No one ever been to that house to be sure they're not still living there when they should not? And after two weeks the house is perfectly clean even no one got there (as they said to AJ on the phone)?And apparently that house had been rented to other people before (remember the bottle of wine they left?): Where are they now? They're dead? The just left?The cops scene: Tess managed to escape the house, calls the cops, brings them home and they didn't even check if she was telling the truth? Like knocking on the door and making sure everything and everyone is alright? As far as I know, if they have a suspicion of a crime they must investigate. This made me think they knew what was going on in the house and they were too much scared to intervene but this remained just a theory as that is never explained.The homeless guy has no role in the story except saying what we already know (and his death is silly!)We get a little bit of a backstory about the dad and the ""creature girl"" but, again, nothing really explained too much, just brief shots of a flashback.And here comes the great finale (sarcasm: activated): the creature girl had been squeezed on the house (still alive), fell from about 10 meters height (still alive) and then she dies for a gunshot?And of course: Tess had been shot and bleeding a lot, fell with the creature girl, she kinda looks close to death and she can't even stand up but the movie ends with her just limping like nothing happened.But what amazed me the most is... (drum roll....): the red viewfinder on the gun when Tess kills the creature girl! Really? No one noticed that in post production? What is this, a middle school movie project?To conclude my review, I gave this movie a 5/10 just for the creepy atmosphere at the beginning and the cinematography, which I liked very much.But the writing is pretty bad in terms of character building, pace and silliness of many scenes.",2022-11-17
"Barbarian was an absolutely insane film and one I am too happy I saw in the theater, I'm a massive fan of horror and thrillers in the vein of this film, such as 2014's Creep, one of my favorite horror films of all time, 2017's Creep 2, which I still have yet to watch, and 2022's Barbarian, which was a brilliant theater experience that I highly recommend.Barbarian was a film that I knew almost nothing about at first, hadn't watched a trailer, hadn't seen any promotional materials, nothing, going into this film unexpected is something you'll definitely want to do, Barbarian was a raw an unexpected ride from start to finish, from the opening scene I felt tense, at no point did I know what to expect or did I stop being scared, even during the funny moments I was absolutely terrified.The film did a masterful job blending fantastic music, top-notch tension, great cinematography and an incredible use of flashbacks together to create a truly amazing experience that will be hard for me to forget, every time I thought it couldn't get crazier, it did, and every time I calmed down, I was scared with brilliant jump scares that some of the best I've seen in a long time.The world needs more movies like this, Barbarian is a raw, moving, unrelentingly tense movie that had me laughing, disturbed, chilled, and feeling tense all the way through.I'm gonna give Barbarian an A.",2022-09-17
"Maybe the worst ""horror"" movie I've ever seen. Actually it was more like comedy horror, but worst than Bad Taste. The makeup was bad and the movie scenes were like they were made by high school film club.Only good thing was actor Bill Skarsgård! He was good, but gone too soon. Maybe i should give up, and quit watching any other horror movies thas asian ones. They know how to make a movie oppressive and scary!Every horror movie that relies on blood and guts instead of plot should be categorized as comedy horror.Horror is a difficult genre and only about 2% of all horror movies are actually good!",2022-10-28
"The good thing about the film: the setting. It's just wonderfully creepy when there's a huge vault under a ""normal"" house, which is then discovered by the protagonists.But what doesn't work at all is the plot, because almost none of the protagonists' behaviour makes sense. They consistently make decisions that no normal person in their right mind would make. And so the plot is not driven by authentic behaviour of the characters, but only because the script wants it to be. And you can see this in the movie almost all the time.If you always tell yourself while watching: I would never do that, what he or she has done now, then that is evidence of bad writing and ultimately of a bad film.",2022-12-31
"The first part of the movie was very well done even though there were some parts that weren't realistic in my opinion. I realize movies are obviously make believe so I'm able to accept a certain amount of lack of realism.However, the second part of the movie went completely off the rails and had so many plot holes, unanswered questions, horror movie cliches and just completely unrealistic moments that it was almost as if different writers wrote this part of the movie.It's unfortunate too because this could have been a very good movie had they toned it down a bit. I wanted to like it so bad! I gave it a five and that's generous. I have no clue how this movie has a mid seven rating at this time.",2022-09-19
"All you probably need to know is that Barbarian is a savage horror movie that kicks off with a very nerve-wracking first act, before it takes an unforeseen turn and then eventually makes its way back to connect and continue from the first act. This is a structure of storytelling we only get to see very rarely, but when it's done in this case, it makes an expertly-crafted edge-of-the-seat horror film with extremely clever turns and brilliant tension.If you've seen the trailer, then you'll likely get the idea that this film centres on a young woman renting an Airbnb, only to find out that the house is already occupied by a stranger, and in the trailer, that's all followed by a bunch of bizarre horror sequences. That's all you really need to know if you want some clues, but this is one of those films best going into with little-to-no information and a fresh bag of popcorn.Although it's probably not the scariest horror film to turn up in the past years, literally every second will have you feeling very uneasy and on edge as you wait for a jump-scare or a big twist. It's so hard to talk about this movie without giving it away, but to assure you'll enjoy what the film has to offer, Barbarian is filled with great performances leading through an entertaining story packed with scary imagery and lengthy sequences of solid tension where soundtrack isn't completely necessary, worth waiting to see what happens next.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",2022-10-25
"Never have I ever sat through such nonsense. Don't waste your time or money on this one. I kept thinking it would get better, sadly not. Jumped around and had plot holes big time, if there was a plot. It could have been great but sadly fell very short. I've saw other reviews and I'm truly wondering if I saw the same movie as them..... the entire concept was just well...bad.. I don't want to spoil it for anyone that will take the time to see it. I was angry when I left the theater. It wasn't scary, it had no suspense, the side stories were just plain dumb. Good luck folk but I'm just gonna nope right on out.",2022-09-18
"Here are some quotes from the user ""reviews"":""An absolutely wild ride with a distinct tone for each act""""Mysteries hold tight with each twist & turn.""""Make Sure To Get Front Row Seats!""""I really recommend you go see this film in its first week!""Who talks like that? I'm sure those are real people...Anyway, I was really excited to see this film. The trailer looked promising and there were a lot of reviews online praising it, saying all the right things to make you think this was something special. But, it wasn't. It was a total scam and I wish someone had warned me like I'm warning you. It actually started off good but had a lot of scenes that felt...out of place. I thought, maybe that's a good thing. All these scenes have to mean something right? If they didn't eventually tie into the story, then they wouldn't be there, right? I mean what editor would allow anything otherwise, right? Oh, how wrong I was.Then you find out what core of the film is and it's just a total letdown. The film, sensing everyone's collective disappointment, then hints that there might be something more, but that turns out to be a scam too. So it meanders with that for a while until it enters the realm of parody until it puts itself out of its misery. The positive ""reviews"" are far scarier than the film. Don't get scammed like I did.",2022-10-29
"I had no idea what this was about which would be the best way to see this movie. The first 30 minutes were great. Edgy and ominous wondering where it was going. Then the story turned into your typical 'horror' plot we've all seen so many times before. Silly, unrealistic, gross and fraught with bad acting and weird decisions, People that should die of their injuries don't and all the usual that comes with stupid horror plots.It could have gone a totally different way but it didn't. It would have been a lot better if the film just ended after she got out and had her driving off into the sunset.",2022-11-27
"LIKES:The Pace For the Most Part: Surprising that I say a horror movie has a good pace right? Well, the pace of this film did well and kept me entertained without shirking too many things. Barbarian dives into things very quickly, but then manages to ease on the brakes and starts to slowly drive through the story. It works very well to give you all the details needed to piece the story, but also play very well with the scare factors to help build up the movie. For the most part it works very well, and I appreciate a movie finding the right balance in the shorter time frame.The Comedy: Again, a movie that can use comedy well is rarer than the 90s, and this movie is one of those that found the balance well. Barbarian's comedy is not so many one liners and in your face quotes, but rather subtle hints, sarcasm, and the lame character that Long plays. It's a darker humor, with more dry undertones and ridiculous laughing antics, and it really works for how natural they were wrote into the script. Even better, the movie does a bang up job of balancing it as well, without again doing too much to put it into the movie. When you do this and not shove it down our throats, (Disney Marvel and Star Wars), then you get a victory in my book for a good comedic device use.The Acting Is Great: Horror movies can take shortcuts with whom they choose to act, but the movie again did a fantastic job with this quality as well. Skarsgard is good for the role as the awkward Keith, using that It quality of his to play the ambiguous character role that makes great for the first half of the film. This acting is a nice keeping you on your toes and is probably one of the top engaging characters of the bunch. Long is fine and works for the direction he took his character, more complex at the film continues, but never quite shaking the other quality that he starts with, which again leads to some engaging moments with him. He's the comedic junkie too, but again does it well and is not in the Dodgeball manner that we've seen him in before. As for Campbell, the woman was gold in this film for so many reasons. She was a strong character for the most part, logical, but engaging in her weaknesses and portraying the terror very genuinely. Campbell wins for the best character and the best performance in my book and she does super well with connecting so much of the movie.The Makeup/Effects: When you get to the exciting moments and the revelations, the prosthetics really make the scene the best shock factor of the moment. I can't say much, but the department really made injuries, wounds, and horror elements look really good, adding that skin crawling effect you want in these moments. Alterations to skin pigmentation, dirty grimy motifs, and so many other effects really craft the ick factor and I only wished for some of them we got more time to appreciate their work.The Setting Is Realistic : Horror movies really love making our characters dive into the areas no logical person walk into, or at least one with intelligence. However, this movie again strays from the norm and succeeds in once more giving us a chilling place for the fears to creep out. A normal house, no built on a radioactive dump or graveyard, or is naturally haunted, but just a normal house. That area makes for a very uncomfortable scenario, one that robs you of the luxury a common commodity grants in vacations. I can't say much more than that, but having such a calm setting minimizes the cheese factor to the extent to keep the scares as intense as ever.The Story: A horror story that is actually good is something we don't see planned out too much for the shock, chills, and scare factor. Barbarian though focuses a little more on the tale, and I was very happy with the buildup, character development, and giving us a logical reason for the chaos at hand. The story is gradually introduced, and actually takes a different form for each act that we go in, helping to combine all the components into one climactic act. You don't get too many ambiguous moments to get stuck in wondering, but the film's pace and fun help this aspect and smooth out the story components to give you a complete, if still a bit shallow , tale. Again, it's not too complicated and that works in this movie trying to do a lot.The Balance Of Scares To The Plot: And of course, when you have a movie that works on the scare to story ration, you get a big victory for me. This movie tries to utilize a lot of factors to keep the middle ground, and it works very to keep things entertaining. It helps keep things fresh, doesn't resort to cheesy tactics for the most part and also doesn't go too far out of its way to try to be unique and different. As such, this movie gets big props for what it can achieve.DISLIKES:Not Scary: I'm desensitized I'm sure, but many of the people I watched in the theater did not seem to jump at most of the antics. Barbarian is not the most mind numbingly scary, with nothing we haven't seen before. It uses jump scares well, and the other factors are either comically designed/executed, or more on the gross side for horrors. While this works for the story, it does not work so much for the scariness, so fans like me wont' be quite as impressed with this factor. However, I encourage those who can handle disturbingly gross stuff to really shy away from this movie.Gross Out Factor Is Yuck: Speaking of gross out factor, there is another dislike I was not a fan of seeing. Cregger managed to blunt some of it well with his censorship, doing everything to give you enough of the antics without being in your face, so respect to that and helps buffer things for sensitive fans. Still, the idea and concept of the story is a bit disgusting which can be a bit too much at times. The dark humor again helps mitigate the full intensity, but there are those moments that just aren't for me as the main scare factor.The Story Feeling Incomplete: I said early that the story is wrapped up enough to help give you a complete tale, but there are still so many details that could have had more. Primarily involving the origin story of this debacle, Barbarian really could have used a bit more stuff to help mitigate the stereotypical role that we got. Don't get me wrong, it's still strong enough to do the job, but like a good mystery, there is that curious side you want to know more of what led to all this stuff. And in regards to some of the cases of his past, perhaps a little more insight into that would have amped up the story, though again kudos to Cregger for the censorship.The Suspense is Rather Minimal: Without the full details of this whole thing, seeing the details come out and really helping gradually piece the horror together, the suspense is meh for me. I've seen horror movies where they keep you guessing, making close calls, and taking those characters to the edge where safety is not assured. But this film didn't do that for me and given the other qualities, I would have enjoyed seeing a little more obstacles, strategy, and drama to help add just enough extra stuff to succeed in rounding out the movie. Adding those elements could have again helped with the scares and thriller element.The Interlude: My least favorite thing with the ups and downs of the movie is the Interlude that takes place in the film. At this point, the movie does both a good and bad thing for me in terms of enjoyment. It allows a break of the horror and gives you some comedy to try and enjoy with as a new tale arrives, which helps add a little more suspense and wonder. However, the movie's diversion seems a bit too out of place, the comedy sometimes with it, as they tried to get this second part to build up steam. It would have worked well for me, but the placing seemed a bit random, and the time not long enough to really establish what happened to the group. As such, this interlude is not the worst thing, but it throws a wrench into things that isn't horrible, but just feels a bit out of place.The VERDICT:Barbarian turned out to be a nice surprise for me in this genre, with a wonderful start to the Fall season. The movie is funny, dark, and surprisingly good with the story and scare balance in many ways better than the other films. It is very good for helping balance a lot of factors, keeps good characters in the film with acting that helps bring everything to life. It utilizes comedy well, keeps things at a nice pace, and utilizes the setting and effects very well to help establish the tension they were going for. However, the movie was not very scary to me, more gross out moments, but the censorship helps things out for those who are sensitive, though enough to still get the message across. There is still some edge missing from the movie, that oomph that other films have done to really heighten your suspense, alongside an interlude that both does and does not work for me given its placement. As such, the movie overall is a fun movie this weekend, and I can say theater worthy, but also probably more likely to be enjoyed at home if being honest. Overall though, not a bad movie to add to the list.Horror/Thriller: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.",2022-09-10
"I was more shocked than scared by this movie.I wish they had gone more indepth with Tess's background and the backstory of the previous owner.We definitely got more of AJ's history and details but in hindsight, I understand why.I enjoyed the story and directing and mystery aspect. It was more shocking then I expected.I don't like trying to ""figure out"" movies. I enjoy letting them wash over me.I don't think I could have figured this one out if I had tried.This movie is best watched going into it blindly.Do not read about it or watch any other clips.I give it a solid 8 due to the creepy storyline.",2022-09-09
"Went into this movie last night only knowing the basics of the movie.Now the first third of the movie was excellent and if this film had kept this bit up I would be scoring it an eight or nine.The tension was high, the acting was excellent and the movie was going in the right direction.Then Justin Long comes into it, now it's not his fault but as soon as his character comes into it the movie loses all its tension and the story goes down a different avenue.Okay so the story starts again with Justin going to the same house, okay now I would give the movie maybe a five or six, yes the movie had gone down that much.Then there is the last third of the film and this is where the movie seemed rushed and the director didn't know what to do with the characters, now on this final third I give the movie a three.What a car crash if a film the last fifteen to twenty minutes totally wrecked the film and it became awful.The violence didn't suit the first third of the movie and now it just seemed to be out there for the audience to have something to talk about Bill Skarsgard was wasted in this film, then again with the finished product I bet he was glad to be out of there.Do not listen to the high reviews this film was awful.",2022-11-27
"Way overhyped. I agree with several of the reviews in praise of the first few scenes - there's definitely a feeling of tension and anticipation of what dread awaits the main character. Then, there's a jump cut to another character in high spirits, driving along the coast highway singing to the radio. I thought to myself, 'this is interesting - how does it relate to the trouble back at the house?' Unfortunately, it's all downhill from there and I soon found myself wondering how much longer the movie would last, which of course pulled me right out of the story. That's when the yawns came and persisted to the end. Well done for the high ratings - it got me to pay for a ticket.

"Stay in an Airbnb house with a horror neighborhood? It's a good hint that the movie will be bad.The story is so bad, that you will scream, ""what are you doing?!"" to all characters in this movie. A good horror movie is not just about monsters, or jump scares, and then you put aside the logic of the movie. That's the biggest problem in Barbarian. This movie doesn't have any logic. You may not find the reactions and decisions of each character in this movie in the other horror movies, because it's illogical! I give hope that the movie will end with a good explanation of some mysteries or some twists. But it's not.How dare they write on the trailer this is the scariest movie in years?",2022-11-24

"The first half of the movie keeps a really good pace and intrigue, with a very simple start, it triggers lots of conjectures and will keep you trying to guess what's going on, because nothing's really clear and seems like a lot is happening (and has happened).There's a break and introduction of a new character that felt like weird way of editing the movie, not very smooth and not really needed for the story or style.Still, that doesn't bring down the movie, there are some tense, creepy scenes afterwards and we get to see more and more in the darkness of the events.But then, when there's enough light to see what's going on, it just doesn't add up much, and there're lots of things up in the air that don't add up or are explained. It just ends up being a chase/escape kind of movie, with lots of stupid reactions and behaviours, little common sense and a very weak story ending.I have to give it a decent rating because I thought the first half was good, but it doesn't end up being a solid story at all.Good performances, good cinematography, weak story and script.",2022-12-07
"Best horror I've seen in awhile. It also has a dash of comedy, which I always appreciate. This was a great movie to see in theaters as well. Not too many jump scares, just quality shock value scenes that make you squirm in your seat while nervously laughing.Justin Long always seems to wind up in these horror comedies, namely 'Drag Me to Hell' and 'Tusk'. It definitely works for him. Bill Skarsgård nails it in another great horror, though he's definitely no Pennywise this time. And Georgina Campbell does very well in her role and would not be surprised if I start to see her more often in bigger roles.I hope this is just the beginning of much to come from director Zach Cregger.",2022-10-05
"""Barbarian"" was PERFECT at the first 44 minutes. It was well-written, the horror atmosphere was excellently built, Georgina Campbell and Bill Skarsgard are great actors with great chemistry, and despite their meeting is not original at all (a Netflix rom-com released this year already worked with this base of ""two unknown people are forced to share an airbnb""), it's well executed. But unfortunately, I think my praises stop right there.At this mark of 44 minutes, the film suddenly changes its tone and protagonist, almost unintentionally following the ""Relatos Salvajes"" formula (I love that film, but that structure doesn't work here). Justin Long is far from being a bad actor, but he is also far from being as interesting as Georgina or Bill. And consequently, the story loses almost all of its strength as we're following him now.The story progresses, and there's nothing more to save from this point and beyond. Jaymes Butler is a wasted character, the idea of the ""scary thing"" is far from being as innovative and original as people talk it is, the police here is brainless and there's a gratuitious flashback involving Richard Brake. I think it was one of the most empty flashbacks I've ever seen.Oh, and the ending... wow! It starts ridiculous, appeals to a disturbing scene to create more impact (the film does it a lot, it's made of isolated disturbing moments filled with a boring plot with an obvious soundtrack), a character takes the most stupid decision of the year, and when the screenplay had the opportunity to fix that mess, it takes the exact opposite way; I think this was the most revolting ending of 2022.I'm not giving spoilers here because I know I'm part of the minority here, and even I didn't like the film, I still recommend it, I think everyone should have their own experience. Mine was not good (actually, I think I only had 8 good experiences with 2022 films after ""Top Gun: Maverick""), but it doesn't mean that yours will be.",2022-11-05

The writing, the performance, the editing, the cinematography, music, pretty much everything. Something that I liked about the writing is that they start off as pretty much like a normal horror movie, we are like so invested in the characters, there is like a lot of thrill and suspense. Then at the mid point they stop the movie at a really good high point. Then they Go into some different kind of plot, and then they integrate both the plots together, i mean I just loved that writing style.Perfomance by all the actors were awsome. The camera work is marvelous. It's a must watch according to me even if you like or don't like horror genere.",2022-10-27
"This movie started out really interesting and different. The first half was just weird and somewhat thrilling, I really enjoyed it. Then it just starts to go downhill, they had the right idea, but something is definitely missing. Almost becomes comical towards the end. Overall worth a watch, started much stronger than it ended.Synopsis:
Traveling to Detroit for a job interview, a young woman books a rental home. But when she arrives late at night, she discovers that the house is double booked and a strange man is already staying there. Against her better judgement, she decides to spend the evening, but soon discovers that there's a lot more to fear than just an unexpected house guest.",2022-10-27
"It's best quality is how it weaves it's tale. Not laying things on the table too soon, the first half keeps you guessing as to where it's all headed, effectively stretching out the time it takes to reach the inevitable monster chase scenes. It's a clever bit of misdirection that the whole Bill Skarsgård, Airbnb plot that takes up the trailer and early portion of the film is essentially a red herring for the scary lady in the basement stuff that permeates the climax.Once we get down to business, the creature in question is a bit goofy, and I'm not sure how gnarly naked people became such a popular horror theme this year. It's a bit silly that they attempted to explain her super human strength as the result of inbreeding, cause I don't think that's how that works. While the campiness does dilute it from being genuinely unsettling, it's at least approached with a sense of humour, I mean, think it is, unless I'm just so desensitized that I found it all a bit funny when I wasn't supposed to.It touches on how men and women approach matters of personal safety differently, as well as drawing attention to the situation in Detroit (I've driven through there, it actually is like that). These themes are neatly tucked into the plot though, so they're there if you look for 'em, but you could easily just choose to focus on the surface level spooks, which is exactly how subtext is supposed to work.It's a simple little chiller that's not without it's charms, and though there are plenty of other movies that I've enjoyed similarly that aren't getting a fraction of the attention that this is, you can't hate on it just for being popular.",2022-12-14
"The best thing Barbarian had to offer was it's bare bones trailer that left a lot to the imagination. Sadly, that's where a lot of the magic ended for this OK but formulaic horror. It started out promising and then got better and better as Justin Long showed up but as the twist was finally revealed and the pieces of the puzzle started to come together, it felt a little lame and more gross than scary. Yeah, I guess the whole incest subplot made for interesting world building around the characters but it didn't make much sense for the villain other than for her to be a lumbering brute. The whole affair ended up being unexpected but not in a good way. The other thing that bugged me about this movie was the title. Other than ""Barbary"" being the name of the street where the movie takes place, ""Barbarian"" was a pretty unfitting title for this drooly, claustrophobic horror movie.",2022-09-14
"In, like, every movie - but especially horrors? She's unlikeable, nosy, invades a guy's privacy who's nothing but nice to her, impolite, annoying - are those actual qualities directors and writers strive for? Because it makes me not want to watch the rest of this cringey movie if this is who I'm supposed to waste 2 hours for.Or are we meant to pretend this is totally excusable because she's a female and some beta writer decided to push her action as reasonable? F you.And of course the typecast handsome male character whose trust she abuses is tripping over to praise and worship our not-handsome and very unlikeable female character, because this is a 2022 beta movie...Whatever, it's nice to see Bill Lastname from It. And Richard Brake - this guy is PERFECT for horror movies. He don't need no makeup to be creepy.So the movie starts kind of boring and slow, but with enough good setup to keep you invested and watching. Unfortunately, halfway through it just flatlines suddenly, and you lose all interest in watching the rest. It becomes a cringey, weird mess that changes tonality in every scene, and culminates in the most predictable, generic ending possible.The other reviews were correct - this is garbage. Do not watch, unless you're masochistic and just looking to waste 2 hours of your finite life for literally nothing of substance.",2022-12-08

I can't watch it again or recommend it to any of my mates unfortunately....... I hope they don't come up with a sequel now as it'd never be a part of my movie directory.

"Category 2Not all directors are created equal. Some are better than others and some are MUCH better than others. Zach Cregger is especially good at his craft. However, that said, there are basically 2 categories of great directors. The first class uses their skills to take the viewer where they want to go, following the well-trod path and the well-worn tropes. The second class breaks the rules and takes the viewer where he wants to take them, never quite meeting expectations. Thats the key to Barbarian, really a hilite reel for Cregger. Lots to enjoy here if you have patience. Watch how a beaten-down urban scene becomes scarier than any haunted house you have ever seen. And marvel at the cohones it take to sign Justin Long for a film and then bring him in late. Worth the watch. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

The story is terrible, typical of the genre. Everyone in this movie makes illogical, stupid decisions, and the part that disappointed is that there were ANY survivors of this really bad story.No suspense, predictable plot, repetitive sequences used as 'fillers', and weird breastfeeding sequences gone horribly wrong, leave the audience wanting their $$ back.Skip it.",2022-09-17
3.5 out of 5 stars.Barbarian is a pretty fair horror film. Definitely throws the audience expectations into a different direction which is best to see without knowing much about it.The plot follows Tessa who rents an airbnb house and comes across Keith. Which the airbnb double booked them both. Keith invites Tessa to stay. Tessa becomes suspicious of him and what lays under the basement.Can not give much away about the plot without going into spoilers territory. It does have a surprise that spins the direction into a creepy tone.The cast is great. The music score and direction builds the suspense.The film script does shift its narrative story a few times in different characters perspectives which takes you out of the suspenseful tone. The film is not really scary which it tries so hard to be.It was worth the effort.,2022-09-10
"I'm seriously confused. This film is not good. The most basic plot ever and characters who make the dumbest decisions ever. Are we still doing this? Let's break the stupidity down shall we?-Woman shows up to a rental property and decides to stay the night with a complete stranger.-She sees nothing wrong with the delapidated neighborhood and her house being the only well kept one.-A woman literally tells her not to stay there and somehow this still isn't a red flag.-Finds creepy hidden passage says ""nope"" but goes anyway. Brilliant.-sees obvious torture room with bloody handprint but decides not to leave because random guy she met says not to.-instead of getting help she ventures even deeper into the creepy lair to help a guy she met THE NIGHT BEFORE.gets caught.-some other guy finds tunnel after a lengthy set up to get him to house.-guy ignores every red flag for some odd reason that defies every human instinct.-cue humanoid monsterYou can guess the rest. A 7 is absolutely criminal for this movie and you can argue its a parody/comedy of horror tropes. I'm convinced the average movie goer is just braindead at this point because there is nothing new here in the slightest. You will enjoy this if you enjoy watching characters who probably have the worst decision making skills mankind has ever seen.",2022-11-08
"This one scared me to death. There is even a ""jump scare"" with a warning, so, actually, it wasn't a jumpscare, but it is such a terrifying scene, that it did the same to me as a jump scare would do. Imagine that.On the other hand, it is incredibly funny. There are some hilarious scenes. But these appear unintentionally hilarious. For example, there is one scene, when the house owner is trapped and he was forced to do 'something' inside a cage, and later on, in a room. I loled so much - my stomach still hurts. This is a great movie. Absolutely unpredictable, at any point. You might think, okay, this is going to be the same thing as I have seen several times before - no! It won't be the same thing. You won't have any idea, what the next surprise of the movie will be. Avoid trailers and spoilers at all costs.",2022-10-27
"I watched Barbarian without knowing anything, except that people have good things to say about this film. And i'm glad i did. I think you would enjoy it better if you know nothing about the premise, since the mysteries and tension is the main driver of this film.That being said (i'll try to be vague), the first act had the best tension build up of any horror films this year. The tension of not knowing what is/will happened keeps me on edge for literal 30+mins. It's captivating, visually striking, great score, the dynamic between the 2 main perfect. It's soo good.Yes, the second and third acts kinda went south, and the ending is a bit lame. But considering how good the first act is, it's really worth the watch. Probably best horror films of the year. Regardless of the bad reviews, it's a fresh horror (kinda). A very well (i think) big screen debut from Zach Cregger. Well Done.8.4/10Highly reccommended.",2022-10-27
"The movie starts out with a very interesting scene of a young woman arriving late at night to what seems to be a case of double booking Airbnb. It's late, the neighborhood isn't good and she has nowhere else to go. The other guest is a guy, a complete stranger. He invites her to come inside and stay the night. What should she do?I loved this scene because I enjoy horror movies that are more realistic. When the fear is real, I find the movie to be more scary.Unfortunately that's the best scene in the whole movie. It goes downhill from there. In the beginning the character's behavior and hesitation is understandable but the more you watch the more you see her doing unreasonable stupid things like (spoiler alert) finding a secret, dark, super-creepy tunnel in the basement and going inside.The general idea of the movie is not bad but there are too many unrealistic things going on and lots of plot holes. When you finally get the complete picture it's just not worth it. It was very disappointing. If I had known what was coming I would have stopped watching. The story doesn't add up, the character's behavior is borderline ridiculous and there are too many unrealistic and unexplained things going on.It's a shame really because it had a potential but unfortunately it totally missed the mark.I'm giving it three stars: one for the first scene, one for dragging it long enough to keep the viewer guessing and one for the acting. I wasn't familiar with the actress but I thought she did a good job with what she was given.There are so many unnecessary remakes of good movies. Someone should think about remaking bad movies that had potential. A movie like this. With more work on the script it could be really great.My advice: either skip it completely or watch the first part and then read online what's next. If you'll watch it to the end you're just going to be disappointed and feel that it was a waste of your time.",2022-11-09
"Yet another excuse to apply sexual violence against women and gore. The writing is so astronomically boring and distasteful. I'm genuinely surprised at the reviews this has gotten.The characters don't even make sense, and their interactions are even more confusing. A woman smart enough to run at the sight of blood, then turn around and run towards the screaming. Tell me you couldn't find a way to throw in a horror scene without telling me you couldn't find a way to throw in a horror scene. Inconsistent, lazy writing, and horrible story.Don't waste your time watching this people, it's mediocre at best.",2022-11-22
"Utter rubbish, believe the negative reviews, wish I had. Just nonsense. Feel i have wasted time again as had such good reviews.Promising start but too many errors, makes you think she deserves what she gets for being a dumb ass in the first place. I mean, why would you even stay there in the beginning, nothing makes sense or feels right.Then it just gets even worse, doesn't make much sense, it's daft, unbelievable and I lost interest half way through. Little explanation of what has happened, happening or what's expected.Can't believe I suggested this one, so my film suggestions have dropped below normal parr now.",2022-11-05
"What a strange unexpected and weird movie, starts off pretty normal, it's leading you seemingly in one direction, you make assumptions on the situation as it all seems a bit too good to be true but then it goes off in another direction completely.The films almost split into 3, Tess and Keith, AJ and then the odd balls. They mesh together, then to be honest I can't work out if it's an awful mess or entertaining. There are 3 bits that the cinema howled with laughter towards the end including a beautiful swan dive, but I'm unsure that's what they were going for.The characters on the whole were stereotypical and nothing special, the acting by tessa was decent, didn't think much to either of the guys, I don't think I enjoyed AJs presentation but I guess they needed to portray him in a certain light.Whilst not bad there were glaring issues which stopped me getting particularly immersed. Firstly, tessas car had lights so how did she not see how bad the area was? Drivers would notice things as obvious as that area. Secondly the job lady or family, it made little sense that no one came looking for tessa. Why didn't the guy living there call the authorities, why are the police portrayed as completely unwilling to help? Is that how they are in America? It's just ridiculous.Lastly the timeline of 40 years and the insinuation of multiple generations of inbreeding created the villain seemed a bit peculiar, as I don't think genetically that would happen at that level but I guess it's not the worst idea. Overall it has moments and parts you'll enjoy, if you fully switch off you'll probably think more 7 or 8/10 but when the little things annoy you, it kills it for me.",2022-10-31
"Wow. Just wow. This was a very strange movie but in the best possible way. It was totally unexpected. It started off making you think it would go one way and quickly shifting in a totally different direction and did that several times while stile maintaining a consistent and good story line. There were so many gross and wacky twists I was honestly not expecting. It was one of the more original and creative movies I've seen in a long time. Also, for a horror movie it actually had a strong level of quality. It's totally worth the watch especially if you have a sick sense of entertainment and movies.",2022-10-28
"Lol seriously??? I cannot understand why the majority of critics praise this trash. To me it's YET ANOTHER (overrated) pseudo horror flick that has nothing to offer. It's slow, it's lame and unsophisticated. Not to forgot how STUPID it is the the majority of screen time. Why? Random unlikeable actors without skill show utterly silly, irrational, illogial behavior at all times. Any character! It's so bad, it hurts. Like PITA you know?Also, YET ANOTHER movie which feels hastily made like shot by students during a weekend. It also lacks of originality and style, feeling very low budget. I am surprised it took hundreds of people involved to create such trash. It even further surprises me that most of the people actually like it. For what? Excessive strong language in lame, simplistic dialogues or monologues ? Non-existent horror? Non-existent humor? I don't get it. I would go so far to say that any sane human would feel like I do now after watching this ""movie"". If not: wake up people? WHAT is WRONG with you? WHERE are deccent horror films these days? Even the music sucks. It's all just pathetic, sorry! (Or am I?)I am so sick and tired of this garbage that I only give 1 out of 10 stars for the first time now. Although I truly believe that no movie could be as bad as 1/10, but this madness has to stop...",2022-11-18
"The movie started out strong from the set pieces, performances to the tension. The second act balanced quite nicely between horror and comedic relief. The characters were surprisingly rational with their decisions, a rare trait in recent horror media.However, the ending really insulted the audience. An extra character showed up solely as a plot device. They did briefly show the real backstory but it just felt so half-assed. Some stuff was never explained like how the cops ignore the protagonists, or the person who pointed them to this particular AirBnb...Overall, it was going so well until the ending where I actually laughed out loud at how ridiculous it was. It was like either the director got tired of making the movie by the end or they ran out of budget and just decided that was good enough.",2022-12-28
"I have NO idea how this movie got such a high rating, it's about some psychopathic barbarian woman who lives in a basement and wants her victims to be her babies so she can bottlefeed them and love them, and yes, I literally said bottle feed, she really tries to feed the victims by a bottle. The movie is that ridiculous. Then if THAT isn't bad enough, she tries to breast feed the one guy! Which is disgusting. I have no idea how a stupid garbage movie like this and so many other disappointments get high ratings. The hype is fake, or people just have really bad taste nowadays because this film was nothing but disappointing and stupid and lacked a storyline and wasn't scary nor was it creepy, nor did it explain who that freak in the basement really was. So therefore no storyline, made no sense, adds up to nothing but a waste of time.",2022-10-28
"It is a great horror movie overall with the story, characters, suspense, and the ""reveal"" that I did not expect that I got shocked! It is about two AirBnB owners not knowing that they double booked the same house for some unknown reason that they decide to stay in the same house for a couple of days. Until one day, one of the owners named Tess goes into the basement and what lies beneath it are hidden nightmares that has been inside the house for years. I definitely recommend it, has a good kill count, film was great, and it is worth a second watch in my opinion. You should watch it for a great horror movie that is worth your time.",2022-09-10
"Although somewhat well acted, this movie is stupid and boring, no story at all, it doesn't even have a plot. Nothing to keep us hooked. The narrative has layers that have no point, and if you watch it waiting for some kind of interesting development, you'll be disappointed.I'm pretty sure it was filmed in a couple of days. After half an hour I was watching it on the TV while browsing Facebook on my phone.I wonder what motivated the director to write and make this. It's such a waste of time. If the intention was to make it a cult film, it's a fail. It's a one time watch in a lifetime.There are so many good horror movies made this year, this falls very short.",2022-12-24
"This is a gross out movie. It ain't cinema except for the terminally bored who need the intimations of extreme torture/pornography to catch their interest. It is baffling that people took this trash so seriously they were warning against any spoilers. As if there were something worth discovering. There might have, if the film delivered what it appeared to be, but the baddie is just silly yuck and the story titillation of torture nudity. The pretentious can talk about themes and the ""real evil"", as if a sad origin excused anything. References and larger themes don't make something good. You can find greater ideas in anything; because humans create patterns even there were none. Still a bad flick. Fine if you like the sicko genre!",2022-11-01
Haunting and unique. Barbarian is a story packed with many concepts that can coexist at once. What's interesting is Zach Cregger putting together the best bits of each concept to produce a truly immersive story. Movie doesn't rely solely on visuals instead it does a wonderful job with audio and sudden shift of scenes within the storyline. Visuals were perfect to keep the viewer engaged never letting to guess right. Performances by the whole cast is flawless. However Tess's interactions with the world outside should have been better especially when her employer sounds alarming about brightmooor. But to conclude Barbarian is a must watch horror.,2023-05-20

"Writing-wise I was just thinking ""wow, every character has done totally logical things so far"" when a woman decides to go into a dark tunnel for no good reason. Now, I have mad respect for the WKYK co-creator (was happy he was behind the film when I discovered it) and enjoy another comedian getting their career revamped in horror (not sure why this is a thing, but not complaining). I was super impressed by the set up of the tension and scares, characters not going too far down scary ventures & staying in unfamiliar AirBnBs due to sold out motels (and not knowing how bad the neighborhood was)... lots of great, great motivation to continue forward. The film totally loses the good will when she, a normal woman, runs into the dark to save someone who may or may not be luring her into a trap. I guess she is very into not leaving anyone behind, so I kind of get it, but it was suuuuch a stretch. Beyond this, the film gets a great bit of leverage from the comedy of Justin Long's measuring his square footage instead of being afraid (a distraction from reason). The flashback does a good job of filling in some needed details. I even like how segmented the film is and how characters come back. I overall liked the film. It was just those little motivations that I wish somebody who read it would have just went ""can't we force her to move forward another way?"" I'm glad the film got made and love a WKYK creator is finding some new success. Watch your character motivations, though. No woman would run into a second dark tunnel to save a newly met stranger... and even after she was so smart before to say ""nope"".",2022-09-12
"What a treat to have ""Barbarian"" released to streaming only a month and a half after its theater release. Thank you, HBO! What I like about this movie is that it mixes up several genres and each one is compelling on its own. We have the meet-cute possible romance, comedy from Justin Long, some social commentary, and of course, the suspense, horror, gore, and a bit of action. The build-up is outstanding and I like how it connects completely separate characters under the same predicament. There are a few minor flaws here and there that are borderline contrived, but that's okay since we get spooked and entertained which is the whole point of it.",2022-10-27
"But it was a complete let down. I found it interesting from the start, I was invested, interested in the story, guessing what was going to happen. But then when you finally find out what's going on then it's wholly disappointing. The filming and the way the scenes were shot were inventive. Also I enjoyed how they jumped from dark scenes immediately into lighter scenes to break it up some. The protagonist wasn't a complete idiot, which is pretty common. However as far as actual plot it was a let down. It was not scary and I actually laughed quite a few times. I really just expected so much more based off of the ratings.",2022-11-10
"I wasn't expecting the Next Great Horror movie so I kept an open mind, and I was pleasantly surprised by the first part of the movie. Unfortunately, the storyline soon veered along a completely different trajectory, eventually plummeting into utter ridiculousness. Snippets of good ideas interwoven with moments of creepy suspense couldn't save this mess of a story that tries your patience by feeding you implausibility after implausibility...and, I'm sorry - but someone please tell the writer or director or whomever...that the baddie ""isn't really dead"" trope has been done to death (pardon the oxymoron) and is just, well for 2022 - lazy storytelling. Unfortunate for a movie that had such a promising start. High marks for the Airbnb/Bill Skarsgard bit...but as for the the rest - turn it off and watch ""The Descent"" instead.",2022-11-18
"A women in town for an job interview finds out her Airbnb is not quite what she though. She finds herself sharing it in a nearly abandoned neighborhood with another visitor that double booked the location by mistake.This film does a great job and leading you in many directions and flipping everything you thought upside down on itself. It evokes some emotions I had not felt in horror for years. I quite enjoyed it. As every movie, especially scary movies, there were a few plot holes. Although they were easy to overlook. A second viewing would never do it justice. The first time truly is the charm in this graphique horror/thriller.",2022-09-17
"I can't express this enough: never have I seen lead characters make such stupid decisions. There is an insurance commercial that says: when you're in a scary movie you make bad decisions. WELL, this one takes the cake. The fact that it has such high ratings makes me think the Horror crowd likes the HIlls Have Eyes type concept, but it just is too stupid to accept even the initial premise that someone would rent an AirBNB, show up in the middle of the night with a stranger already there, in a terrible neighborhood and then elect to stay the night, while drinking with him. Thats only the beginning of how stupid the lead character is. Trust me when I say that its a painfully stupid script and the acting makes no sense relative to the situations. I'm not sure what the viewer is supposed to glean from this non-sensical plot.",2022-12-09
"Barbarian started very well. Bill Skarsgård as Keith and Georgina Campbell as Tess did a good job and had good chemistry. The movie was exciting, interesting and mysterious. I believed Keith was the villain, except for some moments when I didn't think so. He confused me, I didn't know what was going on, which was a good thing. The whole first act was really good, until Keith was murdered (by the barbarian?). This was the first 45 minutes of the movie. Then we are introduced to a new character. What is going on? I thought it was an interesting change in the movie when this happened, but this interesting change was not that interesting very long. It was now that all the plot holes and weird things started.This new character, Justin Long as AJ, is the owner of the house that these two previous main characters rented. He moves in there himself after being fired from his job and accused of rape. He discovers the hidden part of the basement with all these creepy, unpleasant, dark tunnels where Keith got murdered. He starts calculating how much he can sell this house for now that he's discovered all this extra space. He begins to measure. He walks backwards into the dark tunnels as he measures. Who even does that? Do you not explore the tunnels first and check what's there before you start measuring? And who even walks backwards into the dark?I could write for as long as I want about this film, but here are some of the questions I had:Why is the movie called Barbarian? Is it The Mother who is the barbarian? How can a malnourished woman, born through incest, tear someone's arm off? How did Tess and The Mother survive the fall from the water tower? That leap over the edge of the water tower looked really stupid by the way. How did The Mother and Frank (the father of The Mother) survive in the basement for so long? How does AJ manage to accidentally shoot Tess even though she's standing in the light AND he also has a flashlight pointed at her for a few seconds? And what about the cops? Their behavior was very illogical and stupid. What about the man running towards Tess and trying to warn her, which only scared her more? Why not explain what is going on in that house to her? It's not the right way to warn someone like that, is it? There were more questions I had that I can't remember now.I liked the first act very much. The characters, the atmosphere, the mystery and so on, and when the first act ended the film was at least a 7/10. But considering everything that happened after that, the rating was lowered quite a bit. It's like they changed writers halfway through the movie. My final rating is 5/10. It had potential, but they completely ruined it. They should have made the barbarian/mother/monster more like the monsters in the movie The Descent. Then it could have been really good, if you fix all the plot holes and stupidity too, of course. Very disappointed.",2023-08-27
"The Horror genre is one that hasn't exactly gone anywhere in terms of quality. Yes, every year there are some absolutely terrible ones, but it's the one genre that always seems to release at least a couple of great ones each year. Barbarian is the latest to have a wide theatrical release, and not only is it one of the best I've seen in a while, but it's also probably one of my favourite films of the year in general. Without giving anything away, I'll say this is the type of film that's all about execution. If certain things weren't done perfectly, it wouldn't have worked either, but I can't believe how well this film worked and here's why.The synopsis that's given by the website IMDB.com says, ""A woman staying at an Airbnb discovers that the house she has rented is not what it seems."" I'm choosing to quote that instead of getting into details because it's the type of film where any further explanation will just ruin your experience. Halfway through this film, I thought I knew how it would play out, but there are a couple of massive tonal shifts that surprised me. While the tonal shifts are my one complaint, they're also what makes the film so great. I found the main shift of the film to be very jarring and almost took me completely out of the film, but then I had a huge smile on my face and I was along for the wild ride to the end.I knew nothing going into this film, other than seeing the trailer once or twice if that. It was the positive buzz that made me want to see it right away and I'm so happy I went in cold. Try to know as little as possible before seeing this one. Aside from the secrecy, there are genuine moments of tension and also a few moments that were so clever, that all I could do was laugh out loud and want to applaud. The insane way the climax of this plays out had my eyes glued to the screen.I've never seen the previous two films that writer/director Zach Cregger made before this, but I think it's safe to say this is probably his best work yet, due to the lacklustre reviews previously. With that said, I absolutely look forward to what he comes up with next because this was pure entertainment at its finest. It's weird, smart, and scary at times, and has a few twists that truly caught me off guard. I'm almost obligated to give this five stars out of the sheer enjoyment I had with it, but I'll knock it down just a bit for the jarring nature of the tonal shifts. Other than that, Barbarian is a fantastic film that I think any fan of this genre should seek out as soon as possible.",2022-09-13
"I don't know if the low-key advertising was intentional, but I knew nothing about this movie. My 10 year old knows I like horror and asked if I was going to see Barbarian. The name sounded like a Stallone/Arnold action flick, so I said no, but looked it up. Went the next night.Did not disappoint as I had no expectations and knew nothing about it, lol.It was such a cool premise! Of course you're constantly wondering which of this chick's naive decisions is going to seal her fate, but you have to keep watching as the story keeps switching up on you. There are laughs and there's a guy that's a giant douchebag (Justin Long) and it's pretty fun to watch what happens when people think they are better than everyone else.Now every time I get naked I say ""bay bee"" to my husband.

"The filth I'm referring to is akin to movies like: House of 1000 Corpses(2003) and Wrong Turn 2: Dead End(2007). Two really disgusting movies with no redeemable quality.This movie is along the same lines. The plot follows a young woman who arrives at a double booked house. The present occupant is also puzzled about this. Since the time is late and there is no transportation out of the place, the woman decides to stay overnight. She is awoken from her sleep by a strange voice and very soon learns about the horrifying goings on at this place.There are elements of found-footage and first person point of view(P. O. V.), same like the F. P. S.(first person shooter) type of action games like Unreal Tournament, Call Of Duty, Quake Arena etc., etc. Another film you can compare this with is Neil Marshall's The Descent(2005).Verdict: acting is subpar. Sound-effects just not good enough at this level. The director tries to be innovative and clever with his direction but it just backfires on him at the end. The photography is decent though and editing just as good. What this film suffers from is plot holes. You will finish this movie and be left guessing as to what you have just watched.This genre is becoming over-saturated. Here's some more recommendations for you to see: The Strangeness (1985), The Cave(2005), Outpost(2008), The Pyramid(2014), As Above, So Below(2014).Thanks for reading this review.",2022-10-30
"I Will say that the first part was one of the most effective beginning to a movie I've seen in a while, the suspense, The feeling of dread as the girl discovers more about the house and wondering if the guy is a weirdo ...the tense mix of attraction and fear between them... it all works really quite well, so much potential there, there could have been so many misteries and horror lying in that basements, it could have been so nuanced and creepy, it was a fantastic opportunity to show more about the darkness of human nature, Reminded me of the movie martyrs in a way. The contrast of that quaint little house mixed with that creepy horrible corridor down to who knows where could have opened up to so many possibilities . But THEN... all that we see is a creepy monster like woman with overbearing strenght living trough the corridor with her husband thats dying, through a change of tone in a semi-comedic tone , We learn that she was somehow in the space of 40 years the cross of generation hillbilly breeds of of the same guy sleeping with his daughters daughters daughter? Where are the dead daughters? Why is she so strong and big , i dont know, it makes no sense, like at ALL . Why is the guy going down there with measuring tape? It makes 0 sense.",2022-11-03
"It may not provide the highest dosage of jump out of your seat/spill your popcorn scares when compared with some other genre releases of 2022 but there's little doubt that Zach Cregger's surprisingly great Barbarian is one of the most impressive and unpredictable horror films of the year.If someone were too have told us that a horror film set in a Detroit Airbnb, starring Justin Long and directed by a member of The Whitest Kids U Know was going to be one of the years biggest surprise hits both commercially and critically, many would have rightfully laughed them straight back to the crazy corner they came from but against all the odds Cregger's wild journey is a must watch experience that takes inspiration from a raft of areas all the while creating a flavour all of its own.Best experienced with as little prior knowledge as possible, all anyone needs to know is that Barbarian finds Georgina Campbell's Tess (in what is a star making turn) alone in Detroit, only to find that the Airbnb she has booked in a suspect neighbourhood isn't the type of abode one wishes to accommodate themselves in with Bill Skarsgård's oddball Keith (a nice turn from the actor who also producers here) and Justin Long's wannabe property magnate/troubled actor AJ also playing key parts in Tess's far from typical stay.Filmed with a confidence and clear vision by Cregger, Barbarian excels in creating an ominous and well-rounded foundation that takes many various twists and turns along its way, subverting expectations and predictions as it marches towards its bonkers endgame that is surely going to create some of the most noteworthy water cooler moments for film fans to discuss as we near the end of year movie going debriefs.Expertly balancing chills, thrills, spills and comedic interludes (a scene involving AJ measuring the square meterage of his house is side-splittingly hilarious), Barbarian is an all round feature that gives us a fully-formed genre offering that is at home in its wild blood splattered moments as it is its quiet conversation lead moments and in an age where many horror films feel the need to use loud noises and jump scares to fill-in for genuinely spine-tingling chills, Barbarian takes the less trodden path to give its audience a ride that isn't all sugar with zero substance.Feeling like it may well have existed in the golden age of horror of the late 70's and 80's, Barbarian is a breath of fresh air in a genre that has struggled over recent times to deliver products worthy of note and much like we experienced with Jordan Peele and his debut Get Out, it feels as though with this film we have heralded in a new key player in the horror market with Zach Cregger, a filmmaker many will be eagerly keeping an eye on from here on out.Final Say -A film that had no right in being as fun, crazy and well-made as it has ended up being, Barbarian is one of the most exciting feature film rides of 2022 and gives the horror landscape a new offering to get excited about after a lean period of weak entries.4 tape measures out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",2022-11-01
"Definitely a weird one. Some very good horror and the way it splices the terrifying scenes and the new plot points is great. The movie is very unpredictable and you will not know what's coming next. There are some interesting twists and the characters are all different and fun to watch. A lot of great kills and lots of very cool gore with excellent practical effects. Excellent music and overall just looks really good. Pretty funny at parts, lots of weird things happen. While sometimes the way it goes from horror to a whole new character can be a little jarring and slow down the movie quite a bit, I think it worked well. Overall weird, scary, and unpredictable movie that is worth watching.",2022-09-15
"The Good: There's a lot to talk about with this movie. I'll admit, I didn't really like it when I first saw it, and while I stick by some of my initial issues with it, I've definitely come around. The way Barbarian plays with plot structure, tone, tropes, and cinematography are unlike anything I've seen in a while. You can feel the love for the horror emanating from the screen; the people behind this film truly understand the genre and how to subvert and deconstruct it.Yet, unlike so many other films that try to do this, Barbarian is a ton of fun. This movie is an emotional rollercoaster; an overused term, yes, but in this case, genuinely accurate. It's a movie that you cannot predict, so I'd advise going into it completely blind, but maybe watch the FIRST trailer (only that one, and I'll explain why later).The film is shot very well; it's kooky and off kilter, designed to keep your on your toes and feel a bit uneasy. It also lends itself to keep things visually exciting, along with expert editing, that really makes use of great transitions. There's one very notable transition in the mid point that was so effective, people began to burst out laughing. But, not because anything funny was happening, because it was preceded by an incredibly terrifying scene and the release collective tension from the audience was palpable. I cannot stress this enough: WATCH THIS IN A MOVIE THEATRE, it will be a blast.The music and sound design are godly. This is a great sounding movie, with everything from the booming score to the pitter patter of rain drops coming off so clearly and helping create the dreadful, unpredictable atmosphere.The performances are also awesome; Georgina Campbell's Tess is a great final girl and her relationship with Bill Skarsgard's Keith (the emotional crux of the movie) is really well done. I like how the first chunk of this movie explores the subtle horror of being a woman in an honestly relatable situation, yet also subverts our expectations as to what we'd think would happen.There's a lot of good commentary about gender and how men and women see things differently, and honestly, I forgot i watching a horror movie. I think generally speaking, this will happen to most audiences throughout the movie, but in a good way. Which is truly a tremendous feat. However, when this film delves into the horror (which is often, admittedly) it really works. We get a truly great (if underdeveloped) bad guy who again, I didn't see coming. I also liked what they do with this character.The broader themes about urban decay and the sharing economy are present, but not in your face. Setting this movie in depopulated areas of Detroit was an amazing decision too.The Bad:. I think what Barbarian does with plot and tone are admirable, but it doesn't always hit the mark. I felt the abrupt changes maybe lingered for a bit too long, but that's kind of a nitpick. At the time, the movie sometimes feels like it's pulling you out right when things are getting good.My real issue with this movie is that I can't help but feel it needed a bit more narrative oomph. I felt some scenes were missing giving more context, and that the movie was struggling to justify its run time at some points. While I like when movies leave things up to imagination, I think having another flashback of a particular 1980s character would've been good at driving that plot home and connecting the past to the present.Also, as I mentioned earlier, I thought the villain could've used a bit more development and screen time. I like the use of darkness and the restraint, I really do. But, I wish we learned more about them and maybe had one more kill.The Ugly: Barbarian has probably the best trailer of 2022. It does such a good job at hooking the viewer in with a good premise, promising bigger things, and not giving anything away. If you really want to know SOMETHING going into Barbarian, watch that first trailer. It's genuinely a good piece of art and marketing.",2022-09-11
"Anything will past for a good movie on rotten Tomatoes. Every time I go to see a movie they like I wish I had not wasted my money. They love nudity of gross fake women.If it is discussing they love it. It was the worst of the worst of every horror movie I have ever seen. Justin Long is a good actor who seemed to only receive good roles when he dated Drew Barrymore.Why was this movie even made?

"Okay, this was really good when it started. It managed to convey the sinister side of renting a guest house. What if something went wrong with the reservations and have no where else to go? What would you do during such an ungodly hour? You wouldn't agree with the character's decisions but you totally understand where she's coming from. Even when she doesn't follow through with what a local was talking about and just proceeds to go back to the house, even when she's maxed out her fear factor, I mean how would you feel if you get locked in a basement where you found a secret room that looks like disturbingly morbid events have happened on there, and still thought it was a good idea to go after her accidental housemate, you'd still be a bit understanding of her actions.But then, instead banking on the horrifying aspects of what it really is to be human, the show quickly turned into a Drag Me To Hell kind of St. Francisville Experiment mix. That's when I lost all faith and I just zoned out. Oddly enough, I can still remember that disgusting scene with the milk bottle. Ick. I skipped to the part where the female character managed to exit the house with the help of another local AND YET, in spite of the warnings, she still insists on going back because that guy blah blah blah.At that point, I was done and I just didn't care. I'm not a fan of senseless horror, especially those that are big on gore and torture.",2023-02-04
To start off this movie made me so nervous watching it. The plot was super nerve wrecking and super creepy. It was a very good movie. The Mother was unsettling. It was a super creepy character. The main character Tess was amazing. She was a great main character and made me really enjoy this movie. It has a disturbing backstory and it's definitely worth the watch during the spooky season. I'd easily recommend this film to anyone who is trying to be creeped out and just overall scared. It's easily one of the scariest films I've watched in recent years. I recommend this to all who want to be spooked.,2022-10-02
"But first I wanna say, I hope IMDB will change the fact that we need at least 600 characters to write a review. IT'S TO MUTCH. I'm more a talking kinda guy not a writer.The movie, well it was scary as hell some times. (If hell is scary) and there where some fun switches that made it fun to watch. But, there are also a lot of scenes we're there was a lot of irritating ways of acting. And stupid choices. And I was a fan of Justin long as an actor. But damn it guy you blew it in this movie. Ok ok it was your script but damn it. It's like the chucky doll at first you like it, but then.... but seriously I really like the movie even there is a lot of bull. It was really intens. And I was holding my breath many times whaha. So if you like a good scare this one is the one 2 watch.",2022-10-25

The first 45 minutes it allow the viewer to wander their mind about the lead characters and they finally show the real colours.After 45 minutes, the movie swift to different tone and finally came back to the core plot.

"Absolutely garbage of a film. It had some potential but that characters, each and every single one of them destroyed the whole film. These characters are so absurd you would want to just turn the movie off. I have never despised this level of stupidity each character embodied. Their lack of common sense and a series of bad decisions after another makes me want to rip my face off out of frustration and instead cheer for the killer. The only way to enjoy this movie is to support the villain. If you are looking for survival of the fittest this is quite the opposite. It was a stressful movie to watch only because of how idiotic the characters are. It seems like it was written with a bit of desperation to scare by dumbing down characters.",2022-10-26
"Most of the movie was a predictable borefest. The lead woman was good but others were annoying as hell. The secret in the house was predictable as there are many movies which shows them. There was no thrill, anticipation or enthusiasm. It was just a concoction of childish theories which were unnerving most of the time. The forced atmosphere was almost laughable as everyone knows this wouldn't fly in today's world. The music was mediocre as well as the screenplay.The only thing I liked about the movie that it ended well within given time so that I could sleep off the massive disappointment it has been.",2022-10-26
"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)""Barbarian deserves all the hype it received so far! Zach Cregger's unique storytelling in the horror film will leave any viewer baffled, transforming a generic premise into a truly captivating, suspenseful, thematically rich story where the definition of a ""good person"" is brilliantly explored.It plays around with the audience's anticipation, especially with fans of the genre already used to the unfolding of formulaic arcs, through exciting twists and sudden tonal changes.Georgina Campbell stands out from the rest, but all the players are important in embodying the idea that ""appearances can be deceiving"".Mandatory viewing - go in blind.""Rating: B+",2022-11-01
"Barbarian is an extremely entertaining, well-shot and acted film stirring up many emotions, but unfortunately, in the end, extraordinary disbelief.Started out slowly and enthralling, but descended into ridiculousness. Was terrifying between about the 20-30 minute point. There is some comedy interspersed when Justin Long enters the fray around mid-way.Problems: 1) the montrous woman in the basement had incredulous Hulk-like strength, i.e., rips a man's arm off, survives being hit by a car into a house and later a 50 foot fall with the heroine falling on her. 2) The heroine (excellent actress Georgina Campbell) makes several horrible, unbelievable decisions, but fortunately survives because the audience desperately wants her to prevail through this madness. 3) Campbell is shot in the stomach but everyone agrees she won't need medical treatment through the night. 4) Makes the police look really bad. 5) So many other holes in the story which I don't have time to elaborate on.Seemed much longer than its 1:43, maybe because of all the twists. My significant other said it was well done and the scariest movie she'd ever seen. She was actually closing her eyes during some of the scenes and she's seen dozens of horror films so that says something about scare value.",2022-09-14
"The first 40 minutes of this movie were AMAZING, and it got me really excited.Unfortunately, it starts to drag at about the midpoint and becomes a cliché monster feature. Character writing also goes downhill at that point. It almost feels like two different people wrote the movie, and the second one wasn't very competent at their job.It's disappointing, really, because if the movie could have kept the tension it had in the beginning, it could have been one of the better horror movies this year.They didn't need to explain the creature's origins to us, especially since their explanation was pretty dumb.The first part is 9/10, and the rest of the movie is 3/10, so I'm going to give it a 6 for effort.",2022-11-05
"This has a great cast that include protagonist, Tess (Georgina Campbell), Keith (Bill Skarsgard aka penny wise), AJ (Justin Long) et al...The story seems very familiar that Tess books to stay in a rented house in a troubled area but it appears that it may be double booked by another guest, Keith. The film makers do well in playing off whether or not Keith can be trusted or is there more than meets the eye. The tension is racked up as things seem eerily strange in this house.To say more would ruin an experience for the viewer like telling a person the step by step turns of a rollercoaster ride. It is best to experience yourself without any outside knowledge. If you come in knowing little to nothing then you will reap the rewards.It is very old school in its creation & execution. There are scenes that you have seen in other horror films but the way in which this is done is suspenseful. This is an easy recommendation for people to watch.",2022-09-23
"Barbarian had an interesting start and fooled me into thinking the dude acting weirdly towards our protagonist was the horror villain. But to my dismay, the whole first act was pointless and there was another less senseful and generic story to be told.One reason to praise this movie is the believable performance by all actors and the unsettling tension the bunker and the darkness there created.But the story was absurd and unrealistic and as always had that trope where characters in horror movies make irrational and stupid decisions. Noticed the latter when the characters kept entering the bunker and not calling police after seeing the prison seeming room hidden in the basement.The casual relationship of the first 2 characters and the intro telling the background story of the 3rd one did not seem important at all except to elongate the runtime cause it had no implication to the story whatsoever. It just lightened the tension created and made the movie less frightening.Incest does not breed super beings. The creature living in the hole underneath should have been weak and malnourished but she's unhumanly strong and powerful. How was she even able to see and operate in the dark when the others needed the aid of a flash light ?Barbarian seems like two different horror movies. An interesting one that was cut abruptly and a tired one that we've seen a bazillion times. Loved the trailer since it only featured the first act but the movie compared to it was a bit dissatisfying. I was entertained for sure but expected more from it.",2022-11-02
"I don't know a single female who would IGNORE NUMEROUS signs and opportunities to just LEAVE a dangerous and potentially violent situation. Many times she literally just had to WALK OUT THE DOOR. This scenario opens the movie and thus ruins any credibility the rest of the movie may have. No thank you! I've read Gavin de Beckers book THE GIFT OF FEAR which gave this Director inspiration to write this particular movie. Save yourself the time and just read the book. I have a difficult time following movies that set up implausible situations at the very beginning of the movie. Then, ON TOP OF THIS, the SECOND scenario unfolds, and now a MAN also totally ignores conventional intelligence and STAYS in the house.Then there is the THIRD implausible scenario that sets up a major character into ridiculous behavior. I do see the humor in this movie mainly because it is soooooooo bad.The cherry on the sundae so to soeak and Also, worst of all, I'm from Detroit and don't care for the way this city is being portrayed.Script is extremely misogynistic and written poorly. I don't understand all the good reviews.",2022-10-26
"A fresh, funny & fiendish delight that keeps playing with the viewers' expectations throughout its runtime and delivers the thrills & scares without trying too hard, Barbarian is neat in its structure, clever in its setup and effective in its execution. There are abrupt tonal shifts, bizarre moments & wicked surprises in store which ultimately work out in the film's favour, thus making it a welcome treat for horror fans.Written & directed by Zach Cregger in his solo directorial debut, the first act brims with a tense & foreboding aura that at times rises to smothering levels and expertly builds to its terrifying reveal after which it switches to a new subplot and starts all over again. Cregger utilises claustrophobic camera setting for scenes set in the basement & beneath and keeps it still & steady when drama is unfolding in the rooms above.The opening segment also proves to be the strongest, thanks to its anxiety-inducing elements but anytime the tension creeps up, the sudden shift in tone & scenario diffuse it right away. The film also plays with photography, lighting, palette & aspect ratio and though things go downhill after the strong start, the interest & intrigue is never lost. And a lot of credit for it goes to the fab cast of Georgina Campbell, Bill Skarsgard & Justin Long.Overall, Barbarian takes its time to create an ambience that reeks of distrust & discomfort but also cuts the cord whenever things get interesting which becomes frustrating after a while. An impressive outing for a debut effort, this stylishly crafted, skilfully narrated & splendidly acted genre offering brims with enough mystery & suspense to keep the ride fun, amusing & thrilling from start to finish and is one of the better surprises of the year.",2022-10-31

It takes you on a thrill ride, some good scary moments and totally edge of the seat storyline.

"From writer-director Zach Creggar 'Barbarian' is a 2022 horror film that stars Georgina Campbell, Bill Skarsgard and Justin Long. Campbell stars as Tess who is in Detroit on a job interview and is flummoxed to learn that the place she has rented has been double booked, for when she arrives Skarsgard's Keith is already staying there. This leads to a lot of tension as we wonder if this Keith is the nature of the horror film or just a red herring. We learn the answer to that in stunning, brutal fashion and then the narrative dramatically shifts, and the juxtaposition is intentionally jarring as we start following Justin Long's AJ Gilbride who is an actor who's career is melting down due to a sexual assault allegation. This all winds up back at the creepy house in Detroit again and what plays out is original, bizarre, brutal and thoroughly entertaining.I knew absolutely zero about his film walking into it other than its genre. I hadn't seen a trailer and didn't know who was in it, and this is a film that really benefits from walking in blind like that. It makes the shocks and twists that much more visceral and jarring. The actors here all do a good job. I did have to roll my eyes a few times at some of the clear horror movie logic of some of the characters, and I was shaking my head at the screen a few times and chastising the characters out loud like don't go down that hallway, or open that door and the like. This actually reminds me a bit of 'Malevolent'. Not in the story or writing or anything, but both films are horror movies that kind of come out of nowhere with little to no fanfare, and are absolute gems of the genre. The ending didn't quite live up to the rest of the film, but in many movies the landing can be hard to stick, and this film is no exception so while not flawless this little movie is still operating at a higher level than it has any right to. 'Barbarian' comes out of the blue and is an unexpected original horror beacon in a sea of predictable, drab films.Eric's Grade: B+",2022-10-13
"I had to watch this knowing Bill Skarsgard was in it! I also knew Justin long would be a good addition.The first third was a little show but building up to something and not too bad. The rest was ridiculous. I'm left with more questions than answers too.No explanation on how 2 people rented the same place. Why on earth did she go back there, or not call the police as soon as she saw the creepy room with the bloody handprint? Get in the car and drive away then call police.Why would she go to so much trouble to save someone she doesn't know. Yes you'd be scared and worried but I'd be so terrified that I'd get the heck out of the area then try to get help.Why were the police so dumb? Honestly was this supposed to be a comedy?And the mother was able to grab her and both survive the fall? Not to mention she would have bled out pretty bad from a stomach gun shot.Who were all the people they took of the whole premise was him having babies with his children? We didn't really see what happened there all those years.None of the cleaners ever noticed a basement? All the houses around are completely empty and no one seems to care?Sorry so many questions, I get it's a horror movie and not meant to be super believable but this was just silly.I liked being a bit creeped out in some scenes. So I'll give it a 5.",2023-03-08
"This is a movie that caught my interest from trailers at the Gateway Film Center. Now I don't watch them, but I caught the beginning of this one. It looked intriguing and then I stopped watching. Jaime was on the fence though. There are certain things that triggering for her and she wasn't sure if this film would go there. I found some articles for her and relayed a bit of information I could find to help make her decision. She did end up coming with me as well when we caught it opening night at the theater.Synopsis: a woman staying at an Airbnb discovers that the house she rented is not what it seems.We start this off seeing Tess (Georgina Campbell) arrive at the place from the synopsis. She looks tired and is frustrated to find that the key isn't in the lockbox like the message said. She goes back out to her vehicle when a light comes on. After ringing the bell, Keith (Bill Skarsgård) answers. He lets her in and they try to sort this out. It appears that they're both renting the same place, just on two different platforms. He is a nice guy and offers her the bedroom, offering to sleep on the couch so that way in the morning they can figure this out. The two stay up late while the sheets are cleaned as well.In the night, something happens. Tess' door opens and she wakes up. She sees Keith sleeping on the couch, having a nightmare. She wakes him up and he freaks out. While this happens, the door to the basement closes.It gets weirder from there. Tess is told that she shouldn't be staying in that neighborhood. She doesn't think it is that bad, but seeing it in the daylight, it is even spookier than the previous night. She can see how rundown it is and there doesn't seem to be any neighbors. It reminds me of Don't Breathe. Tess gets chased by Andre (Jaymes Butler), who is a homeless man. What he is saying though is intriguing as he doesn't want her to go into the house.This is just the beginning of the nightmare when Tess discovers a hidden hallway in the basement. Keith comes back and she tells him about it. He doesn't believe her at first, but he finds even more. There is also another story involving AJ (Justin Long), who is the actual owner of the house. He is from Detroit but living in Los Angeles. He decides to come back as well.That is where I'm going to leave my recap and introduction to some of the important characters. What I want to establish here is that this is a movie you should come in knowing as little as possible. An article I read about it ahead of time said the same thing. With that taken care of, this opening sequence got me to thinking. This is terrifying. Tess arrives on a dark, rainy night. She notices that there are no streetlights and many of the houses are dark. She is defensive and for good reason. I feel bad that she must be this way, but to be honest, in this situation I'd be nervous. It is a fear of mine that someone else would be in the place I'm staying or comes in while I'm there. That is a good starting place for this movie.Where I want to go a bit of social commentary this movie explores. There is the idea of gender norms. During the talk between Tess and Keith, she brings up that if the roles were reversed, she would not let him in. As a male, he feels safer. Jaime confirmed this afterwards as well. I didn't need her, but we like to explore themes after seeing something. I love that what this couple in the movie talks about comes into play later when they explore the hidden section of the house. We also get things with the character of AJ. He is accused of something and we see how it ruins his life. What is interesting to me though are the things that he says afterwards and his actions. I think that Long was perfectly cast there since he comes off as a nice guy. He can also play a character like this which just slightly stretches his range in the best way. Then to shift over to Tess once more, there is the moment with Andre as well when she arrives back at the house. There is more to this, but that would go into spoilers which I don't necessarily want to do. That would terrify me being chased by someone like him who seems crazy.What I will say is that this gets wild. While in the theater, I realized that this is a modern take on the 'old dark house' with the secret tunnels under the house. What is hidden down there is the true horror of this. I saw coming in that Richard Brake was in the movie, so I knew he had to be involved there. The only thing that I'll say beyond that is this would make an interesting double feature with 2022's X. They're not the same, don't think that coming in. They do have some interesting parallels. Before moving away here, I did want to say there are some loose ends that I wanted explored just a bit more. There is also some comedy near the end that I could have done without.Now to move away from the story, let me go over to the acting. I thought that Campbell was good as our lead. She is a great representation of a strong, independent woman trying to navigate this situation. I like that she is shows what real women deal with as well. Skarsgård is also good. I like him a good representation of a nice guy. The movie makes you wonder about him. I'm not going to reveal if we should or not though. The counterpart to him is Long. I've already said that I enjoyed his performance. Other than that, I thought Brake, Butler and the rest of the cast were good. Special credit to cameos of the voices of Kate Bosworth and Sara Paxton. Overall, the acting here is good. They show real fear when they need to and I appreciate it.The last things to go into would be with the filmmaking. The cinematography here is great. We get some excellent shots that held my attention. They do things with framing as well with using shadows. Being in the tunnels is claustrophobic which I can appreciate as well. I'd even include the editing here to seamlessly mesh these three stories that come together. Other than that, I thought what they did with the soundtrack and design were both solid as well.In conclusion, I enjoyed this quite a bit. We get an interesting set up and premise. From there, it just gets wilder as we go. The acting is good across the board. I thought the filmmaking was on point with special credit to the cinematography. If I have any gripes here, there are some story elements that are left open as well as some unnecessary comedy. Even though I have those issues, they didn't ruin my enjoyment. I would recommend seeing this movie as this is up there as one of my favorites at the time of writing this for the year. I'm hoping I can revisit it as well.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.",2022-09-19
"I love horror movies that keep me very minimal on details as possible. Going in the first 25 minutes of Barbarian it makes you think itll be a thriller type horror movie when towards the second half it surpasses your expectations. Whether it's terrifying or not is up to your perspective and for me I think most the scares did land as well as being intrigued by its backstory. The movie is also great at showing the differences between a protagonist making smart decisions during situations, while another doesn't. Performances are top notch from Georgiana Campbell and Bill Skarsgard as well as Justin Long. The pace runs slow to let your guard down enough & allows for genuine fear moments to hit real hard. Couldn't recommend it more just try to go in completely blind .",2022-09-16
"Barbarian (2022) follows a woman who turns up at her Airbnb only to find it's been double booked with a strange man. I went into this film not knowing what to expect and I'm so glad I did! This film was amazing and definitely not what I anticipated, props to the filmmakers for creating the most unique movie of 2022 so far!The cinematography of this film perfectly reflected the ominous and tense tone. The colour palettes were dark and brooding, and the lighting was used in a very subtle yet effective manner. I absolutely loved the framing of the shots too, and the set designs were eerie with a great attention to detail.The sound design was phenomenal and also added to the atmosphere. For this reason, I highly recommend going to see this film in cinemas! The sound design added to the tension perfectly. The score itself was great too, and equally as unique.The main reason I went to go see this film was because of the actors in it, and every single one of them did an amazing job! Justin Long was darkly comedic, and Bill Skarsgård was strange yet charming. Georgina Campbell was great as the lead, and I was rooting for her the whole time! The dialogue was well written and very engaging with a lot of bleak jokes which I found hilarious.Lastly, the structure was very strange, but it worked so well. I've never really watched a film with a structure that feels messy but in a way that really compliments the story, until this! The film builds up an incredibly high amount of tension and has a satisfying reveal that still leaves room for the audience's imagination!",2022-10-09
"Resorting to the usual inbred killer memes of the superior The Hills Have Eyes, this plot-hole ridden clunker opens with a promising first act before descending into the usual cliches; what was that noise in the basement? Shall I explore this dark tunnel? My torch is suddenly not working! I've dropped my phone! I've tripped over while running away! I can't get my keys in the door when being chased! The police don't believe me!As well as countless plot holes, there's a pointless flashback before the second half lapses into a routine monster chase and physics defying stupidity, undoing all the good work of the first half.",2022-12-21
"Late, but not too late, I decided to catch ""Barbarian"" on the big screen rather than on streaming, and thankfully I didn't know anything about the plot, and you too, don't read further, if you're planning to watch this, which you should, for because of the effort of invention alone, ""Barbarian"" stands out in the pool of late horror movies, and is one entertaining, enthusiastically plotted and terrifically directed mash-up of tried and tested horror inspirationsA woman staying at an Airbnb discovers that the house she has rented is not what it seems - 'nough said, hard to describe this movie well without giving too much away. For the first act, it's a low-key romantic, slowly brooding drama/thriller, which leads you to a seemingly one place, but then director and writer Zach Cregger wrong-foots you, and he will do that again and again, twisting the narrative, and building a very different horror movie than you've been trying to put together while watching it. The overall idea is a little contrived and reasonably far-fetched, and in my opinion is one of the biggest strengths and about the only weakness of ""Barbarian"". It's engaging, creepy and effective in its atmosphere, visuals, sound, plot themes and pretty much everything else, but after the credits started to roll, I had the feeling I would've preferred Cregger to pull off a Ti West and make a duology out of this, for there are places in this universe which I'd very much like to be filled in. With the runtime of 100 minutes, it could've been longer, and that's not something I often say about movies. Despite the feeling of it-could've-been-even-better, ""Barbarian"" is an absolute hoot, and scratches many itches of a horror fan. Cregger balances horror, thriller and comedy brilliantly, with a masterfully helping hand from a well-casted performances and the production design team, further enhanced by tension-building cinematography and sound design. And there are a handful of thought-provoking, topical and above-cliché's plot themes, and some of the well fleshed-out characters will change how you feel about them drastically as they progress. It's something that might be said too often, like I already did, but I emphasize acquiring as little information as possible and diving straight into the movie itself, for the experience of watching ""Barbarian"" benefits greatly from knowing little to nothing about it.Perhaps the most entertaining scary adventure of 2022, ""Barbarian"" is sure to enter horror fan's top 10s, and joins the collection of '22 flicks you should not miss out on. A bit of Wes Craven, a bit of John Carpenter, a bit of ""Don't Breathe"", a bit of Josef Fritzl, a bit of this and that, and a lot of up-and-coming and highly priomising Cregger, it's good. My rating: 8/10.",2022-11-06
"The movie is awful, the plot itself is like a pile of independent story pieces that director tried to sew together. There are three recognizable actors: Bill Skarsgård (his fate is determined in the middle of the movie which is strange as he's the main actor in this movie although not the main role, but undertandeble... seems he understood in what movie he is playing...), Justin Long (Jeepers and Die Hard 4 haven't seen him for a while) and Richard Brake. I still couldn't understand why it's called ""Barbarian"". The movie itself is full of contradictions, lack of a common sense and realism of actions and deeds, 7,1 IMDB??? C'on, not serious...",2022-12-20
"9.0/10Have you ever heard of the 'Russian Sleep Experiment'? This film kind of reminded me of that story. It had me throttled for the entire film. ""Barbarian"" plays right into my fear of pitch black, confined spaces. My anxiety and nerves were through the roof. While I wouldn't say I suffer from claustrophobia in the strictest sense. This film definitely had me gasping for air at times.The film starts off kind of cheesy with its whole cliche ""what's that behind the character"" motives along with the classic screechy music that's supposed to make you feel on edge. However, as the story delves deeper, so too do the thoughts of ""just let me see what's there"" and ""what is there"".This film does what a lot of horror/thriller films have failed to do to me recently, and that's put me into such a state of fear that I have to jerk parts of my body because I feel like if I don't. I'll get taken away.There's a few parts that had me thinking, ""what's this got to do with the story?"" It eventually falls into place perfectly. I also enjoyed the camera shots. You're not really given more perspective than what the characters have, so that adds to the claustrophobia, and anxiety of questioning the next move. Even if thought something would jump out, something would happen, I was still taken aback.Perhaps, I'm taken overboard on my enjoyment, and fear, of this film, but I would definitely recommend checking it out in theatres. It's worth the time and money.Thank you for reading my review. I hope it helps you make a decision on the film. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!",2022-09-14
"This movie can't really be rated this high.Don't waste your time- it raises a lot of questions, but never gives you any answers, characters are not very well written and make the stupidest horror movie choices I've seen recently.Starts off pretty strong, starts developing more characters, their storylines, and once they meet it does not amount to anything. Then it hints at more possible events and horrors, but nothing happens.A slow, creepy start, a couple of cheap jump scares in the middle, and a gory end.Save your money and time. The movie baits you with famous writer/director crew and a few actors you're familiar with, and then it leaves you hanging.",2023-01-08
"It's Crazy the love and the high scores some people are giving this movie. Very questionable and suspicious I'd say. The cast is good but not really utilised as they should. No real investment is given to the main characters, so there is no real connection or feelings for them if they live or die, the characters in the film are all forgettable. The story is really poor and broken. The pace is poor and feels very disconnected. There is very little horror or suspense here. It's a real shame as the first 1/4 of the film feels promising, nice scary music, setting etc but then it just feels like they changed the director and story and it becomes a real mess of a film. Very disappointing. I'd say my 4 score is very fair.",2022-10-29
"This movie was a bit creepy at first. Then the second they killed off Keith the movie started to go downhill. And that was like 40 minutes into the movie with an hour left to go through. My friend - who I watched this with - couldn't watch until the end, while I was laughing so hard my stomach was aching and I was practically wheezing. I'm really trying not to give away much, because I do actually hope that you will watch this movie. It was absolutely ridiculous, that I will say. Bottom line is that the start was interesting but the actual plot was very poor. Best laugh of the week though. 3/10 stars for making me laugh.",2022-12-29
"I read the reviews before and then again after trying to see what I'm missing. This movie is so bad. Yes there is a level of unbelievability in all horror movies but this movie had so many plot holes it ruined the whole movie for me.*Spoilers*
-the man who saves them said the original owner of the house took a bunch of women and had babies with them, then babies with his babies etc, so where are all of them? And how was he able to interbreed with his kids so many times that it created the ""creature"" over a span of 40 years (Reagan is president according to the radio broadcast when he begins buying the supplies)
how does the ""creature"" (what subtitles refer to her as) have such superhuman strength?how was ""the creature"" able to jump after Tess and still land underneath her?Tess was shot in the abdomen and thrown off a water tank but is still able to get up and walk out?the creature got hit by an SUV yet was still able to break through a cement wall, jump off the water tank and land on the ground with an adult woman landing on top of her, and still live? How?",2022-11-01
"At some point in every horror movie we all say the same thing, how stupid can they be to...or, why didn't they just..., We all know this is a necessary ingredient in the scary sauce, but it's just so unbelievably stupid that anyone could be so unbelievably stupid. The question then becomes, can we overlook this and enjoy the movie. Well, sometimes yes and sometimes no. This is one of those movies you can enjoy despite how dumb it is, watch it to the end, and then file it away as what it is; a stupid horror movie that is worth sticking around for until the end. If you care to look deeper into this film, you can find some social critique on the abandonment of neighborhoods and white flight as a cause, and a scene where the cops are portrayed in the way many people have come to view cops. Over aggressive when unnecessary and completely useless when actually needed. I would recommend this movie for a saturday night pizza flick.",2022-11-20
"We have seen the basic plot before dozens of times. Don't Breathe. The Intruders. Episodes of Dangerous Minds, the X-Files, CSI, Buffy, that last Dexter season, you name it.I think what makes this iteration of the normal-house-with-a-bad-basement convention work so well is that it is broken into digestible chunks.Just when you think you have figured out the Pennywise and discount Halle Berry part, it cliff-hangs you. Then we are whisked off to Mac Commercial and his deplorable Hollywood woes that take us back to the Motown mystery house. He bumbles around comically with a tape measure which eventually links back up with a now slightly smarter part 1 character and some off-the-rails scenes. Then the sunshine flashback fills in the context which is so badly needed to tie everything together.The culmination of the three segments into a climax is quite satisfactory because everything was broken up into nice blocks that didn't get stale or overdone with tension to the point of exhaustion. Everything ebbed and flowed at just the right pace.Not sure the social commentary on reverse gentrification worked. But as a straight horror piece with an interesting protagonist and lots of developed characters, it succeeds. The Mother just typifies why human breeding should be as licensed and regulated as AirBnB, thanks.",2022-10-25
"Starts off strong with a great setup and fantastic character work. The beginning is intense while delivering smart believable characters. Sadly it quickly devolves into a dumb heavy handed Castle Freak wannabe, and the characters go from being smart reasonable human beings to being so dumb that you have to wonder how they survived Darwinism up until this point. It's like the film had two writers, and the good writer stopped after the first 15 pages or so.The film wants to be an allegory for rape, and despite starting off on sure footing it quickly stumbles over itself. The opening is a smart approach to this by creating a scenario that shows how the world is more threatening for women than for men. It works very well. As soon as Justin Long shows up the hand gets so painfully heavy that it weighs everything down. He is incredibly cartoony and dumb in the most eye rolling ways possible. He makes impossibly stupid decisions that is downright insulting to the audience, and he stops being a character and becomes a poorly written over-the-top prop villain as he spews out excuses & victim blaming for rape, excuses & victim blaming for shooting someone, and excuses & victim blaming for flat out trying to murder someone. There is zero subtlety or nuance here, and the execution is awful.The monster in this is basically Castle Freak but with superpowers for some reason. I'm not sure why she has powers and it's never explained. Just like everything else in this in this film the creature starts of scary, but becomes a cheesy cartoony monster that can burst through walls exactly like the Kool-Aid Man. The film tries to drum up some sympathy for this monster at the end, but at that point I was so checked out from the sheer stupidity of the characters and the world they inhabit.The film starts off so strong that all these issues hurt when they hit like a ton of bricks. Its sucks to get so invested in a well told story so quickly only to have the rug ripped out from underneath you just as quickly.",2022-12-24
"I'm gonna be honest, I went in with modest expectations because I didn't want to give my hopes up after seeing several high reviews of this movie. And after watching this movie, I can safely say that Don't Breathe seemed to be a huge inspiration in the storytelling of this movie, only Don't Breathe actually told it well. Here are some notes I want to touch on:Story - Tess, an aspiring filmmaker, rents out an AirBNB, but there's already someone living there. A weirdo named Keith, but with nowhere else to go, Keith has Tess stay at the place with him. She starts hearing noises and gets paranoid so she goes and investigates only to find a hidden passage under the house that leads to disturbing discoveries. Now, the problem I have with this is that it's not a very strong story, especially considering it only covers the first half of the movie.The second half of the movie feels almost like it was directed by someone else and the two halves were just mashed together and proclaimed art (as many movies basically are nowadays), but the second half tells the story of an actor trying to get his life together after being accused of sexual harassment, but this subplot goes pretty much nowhere as it's dropped as quickly as it's introduced, just like Keith's character, who's killed off in the first act.The movie feels like it tries to distract the audience with atmosphere and eeriness so they won't notice that the story isn't that great. And of course, you can't have a horror film without some sort of forced commentary, in this case, about motherly love and how a mother would do anything to protect her baby. (This opened up some nice plot holes in the movie people somehow didn't notice, especially concerning Keith's death) And the extra subplot about the old man r*ping girls and impregnating them, taken right from Don't Breathe, only Don't Breathe actually incorporated that into the story in a creepy way, whereas this was just hashed in as a filler plot because why not. I should stop rambling now and just move on to my next point.Characters - The only somewhat tolerable character in this movie was probably AJ, but even he turns out to be a total A-hole in the end. There's little character development for, well, basically everyone. Keith was killed off too early on for me to even care about him, Tess was the typical final girl character that makes stupid choices for the plot to move forward, as does AJ.And the big reveal? The Mother. I wasn't shocked by the ""reveal"" in the slightest. Hell, it's literally in the freaking title, The Mother is a barbarian living under the AirBNB, I had called it from a mile away and knew that this movie was basically treating the audience like they were idiots at that point. Also, The Mother, during the climax, gets rammed into a house and jumps off a high building and splats on the ground, but those don't kill her. Only Tess, whom The Mother believes is her baby, could kill her, with a SINGLE BULLET to the head. You see? It's clever because only a mother's baby could truly kill her, nothing else because it's her baby. Yeah, clever.Conclusion - So, to sum it up, this movie was heavily inspired by Don't Breathe it seems like, and I can see why. Don't Breathe is a much better movie than this overhyped mess was. The story was unoriginal, the characters were one-dimensional and I couldn't care about them in the slightest. Really the only thing this movie has going for it is the atmospheric style, which gave some decent tense scenes. That's the big problem with horror nowadays though. They're either all style and no substance (This movie) or they have forced commentary to replace the story (Candyman 2021, Nope) and those are the worst kinds of horror if you ask me.Spare yourself the time and forget about this movie. If you want to watch a true horror movie, find a slasher film like Scream 5 honestly. That's what good horror used to be, hopefully it doesn't get overtaken by these sad excuses for so-called ""horror"" movies.",2022-09-14
"As others have pointed out, going in blind truly is the best way to experience 'Barbarian (2022)'. It's never quite what you expect it to be, a series of ever-escalating twists that constantly subvert expectation (for better and, in some cases, worse). With that said, I'll try to be as vague as possible when reviewing the piece, but if you have any intention of watching it - as I ultimately recommend you do - then you should probably stop reading this right about now.This enigmatic horror film drops you straight into its inciting incident: a woman arrives at her rented property in the dead of night to find somebody else already living there. Within mere moments, its initial dynamic is established and ripe for exploration. It isn't long before its two-hander of a first act is fully underway, relying on the subtly excellent work of Georgina Campbell and Bill Skarsgard (who are joined later on by an equally impressive Justin Long) to sell the uneasy relationship between its unintentional roomies. There's always a sense that something is wrong, that danger lurks within the halls of this humble airbnb abode, but you're never sure exactly where it's going to come from. The flick somehow creates a connection with its protagonist almost instantly, drawing you into her situation and bringing you to the edge of your seat whenever you feel as though she's unsafe (which is most of the time). A genuine sense of suspense builds throughout the movie's first half, one that leads to a surprisingly scary set-piece involving nothing more than a dark corridor and the prospect that something unspeakably unsavoury may have occurred wherever it leads. The direction is markedly good throughout, brilliantly establishing the geography of any given space and using it to creating tension with even the slightest glide of the camera.If you're like me, by the time the hero walks under the doorframe that surrounds her in the film's poster, you're absolutely enraptured by the affair. You're bolted to the edge of your seat with an appreciative smile plastered across your face, ready to weather whatever storm has been brewing since the end of the 20th Century Studios logo......and then the movie smash-cuts to Justin Long.With a single cut, the tension snaps like an elastic band and the atmosphere dissipates as quickly as when someone puts on Mambo No. 5 at a party. Everything resets to zero and we get what's essentially a repeat of the first act, except the vibe leans further into comedy and the focal character is a total heel. The intent is clearly to shock, to subvert, to callously refuse the audience any semblance of closure. It's jarring by design and, once you settle into the piece's new rhythm, it's typically successful. In retrospect, this movement mostly repeats where it could reinvent or refocus, but it works in the moment because it still feels as though it's building to a climax that reinstates the horrific brilliance of the first half. It's directed well and the performances are solid. It also builds suspense, rising to a level just below that of the moments before the aforementioned smash-cut. As it approaches its final third, it feels as though the feature is going to tie its two halves together and move into a best-of-both-worlds finale......and then, once again, it does a tension-snapping, suspense-sapping, atmosphere-killing cut.The following segment is too long to be an effective aside but too short to be anything more substantial, and honestly it's pretty irrelevant to - or, rather, unnecessary for - the narrative. All it does it take you out of the affair, especially when you realise how inconsequential it actually is. Thankfully, though, this is followed by an actual finale that does tie together the first two movements, one that's still as subversive and tastefully disgusting as you'd expect. The only downside to the climax is that its final moments are incredibly rushed, building off the back of a joke to lead to an oddly elliptical ending that should really have been presented in a more straightforward fashion. Most of the final movement works well enough, though, and there are some really great moments sprinkled throughout.Ultimately, the majority affair is kind of disappointing, more so in retrospect. That's not because any of it is especially bad, but because the first act is so mouth-wateringly amazing. As a whole, it's still an entertainingly suspenseful and enjoyably gruesome experience that has a couple of sequences that are genuinely scary in their own simple way. Sadly, the flick frustratingly shoots itself in the foot on more than one occasion, dampening its own effect by being decidedly stop-start when it comes to its tension. It's still worth a watch and is arguably one of the better films of the year, but it isn't quite as good as it initially makes itself out to be. The first act is phenomenal and the rest is dull by comparison, but the rest is markedly better than a lot of similar fare.",2023-01-07
"Barbarian is that rare breed of horror- visceral- would make your stomach drop and heart beat faster + unpredictable- would make you use your grey cells to prophesize, often wrongly, where it is headed.For 90 minutes of its 100 minute run time, it is a combination of the two. I didn't like the way it ended, but that doesn't take away from the experience that it is.There is nary a dull moment, with the pace relentless. It really got to me at some places. There were many scenes where I felt like shouting to the characters to stay away from dark places. I have been watching horror fairly regularly this month, because of Halloween, and this has been the experience that I have been chasing.The casting is spot on with Justin Long taking the cake.The director could have tuned up the gore quotient just a little bit to make the climax more memorable.",2022-10-27
I've never left a review for a movie before but for some reason I felt compelled to throw in my two cents on this one. It was more stupid than scary. As a matter of fact it wasn't scary at all but they tried and man did they try hard. I was highly interested and ready to see this one too. High reviews and somewhat well done trailers don't necessarily make a good movie. Sometimes maybe but not this time in my opinion and if you read an interview that director Zach Cregger does in which he explains the movie title it seems....well stupid. I was honestly wondering why the movie had that name. Stupid and weird to sum it up.,2023-01-13
"Everyone knows that if the characters in a horror movie behaved normally, there wouldn't be much of a movie at all. Case in point: this nightmarish creepfest, which features a young woman who rents an Airbnb, only to find a shy young man living there already. Can we trust him? Can SHE trust him? Eventually she does, but then the guy disappears for awhile, she gets locked in the basement, starts exploring (cue the bad decision-making), and finds long, dreary corridors deep underground...and a whole slew of other things that would raise the hairs on the back of anyone's neck. The movie's first act is the best, with long, claustrophobic shots of all those subterranean corridors, and part of me wished that the director had kept the flick right there for at least a little longer; but then the images become truly terrifying--one cringeworthy image, repeated over and over again, in particular--and the film begins to overplay its hand, throwing nuance out the window (the grimy basement window) and going over-the-top once too often. The points it's trying to make--about the rampant abuse of women, the sense of entitlement on the part of the stereotypically self-centered Hollywood big shot, the incompetence of some of our men in blue--are worth thinking about, and the twists (especially the one toward the middle that comes barreling at you out of nowhere) will keep you watching, but the whole thing was a bit too nightmarish for me. Maybe I'm just the sensitive type, but a bit more subtlety would have helped.",2022-09-15
"I never watch trailers for movies. I'll read the brief synopsis but that's as far as I go. I'm a huge horror fan and am fascinated by what terrors peoples minds can conjure.I really like the pace and the 'drama-like' presentation of the beginning of this movie. Wondering where it was going was part of the enjoyment. I'd watched 'Smile' the night before so I was welcoming not being thrust into sheer terror within the first ten minutes.The movie revealed itself, new characters and a frightening creature and I went along with it. There were typically frightening things like long dark corridors and creepy stuff but little of it scared me.The measure of a good horror to me is whether or not I want to see it again, do I want to own a copy because the way it is made is artfully creative and did it scare the hell out of me. The answer for this movie is No!",2022-10-25
"I agree with everyone's view of the first half. The second half morphs into B-movie level rubbish. A real let down.I love the whole concept of the story, but then towards the end, just goes into full blown ridiculousness. Some of the decisions of the characters just absolutely did not make sense. In real life, some of those decisions would never have been made.I love the way, the director builds up the tension, with the cinematography, the mise en scène, the music and mystery.Because we had the actor from ""It"" who played Pennywise, the whole first half made me believe there was something more to his character.",2023-01-10
"The production values arent bad, the acting it pretty wooden and uninteresting. Characters just arent cared about.Theres maybe one scary moment, but its ridiculous. No horror fan should approve i think.A dead slow beginning, moving right along to a dead slow second act, with the addition of a very unlikable and sleazy Justin Long. All topped off by a laughable reveal and seriously comical moments. I dont think they were going for chuckles, and they didnt even get them....just my partner and I looking open mouthed at each other in silence.Would have been a two, but some effort was put into the practical effects.This layer cake of forgettable is all built upon a premise seen 100 times before, and improving on I think exactly zero of them.",2023-01-20
"I really love horror movies, and I almost never give a low score if the movie is at least decent. But I think I didnt watch the same movie scored as a 7.2 at Imdb as of today. I can't believe how people can score this thing more than 3 stars being really generous. It's bad, really bad.First, the movie is not original, surprising, or good. It doesn't add anything new to the genre and worst of all is acting. Terrible. Soap opera level. Justing Lang was one of my favorite actors when I discovered him in the original and great Jeepers Creepers. He was great there, but terrible here.Second, nothing in this movie have any sense, including characters, places and dumb situations. The script is terrible and the ending a joke. I don't want to spoil anything, but this movie is a joke. And it's a bad one.Last, If you want a decent - scary - gore great movie, go for Terrifier 2, and skip this nonsense.

"The studio and the creators of this movie have done a masterful job with the release of the trailer of this film and any other visuals in regards to this title. That is to say that it tells you nothing of what to expect. And what you are allowed to see in advance is intriguing enough of a premise, that is, a double-booked home rental for the evening between two strangers.What this film is about and what happens after about forty-five minutes of run time, is some of the best horror filmmaking this century.This is a ten star rated horror movie. And it has truly earned it with a brilliantly scorching script with excellent execution and direction, and sheer perfection from all actors involved.Wow.The movie starts out as you would expect, that is, how the trailers and the filmmakers have led you to believe it should be.The female protagonist arrives at the front door of an unfamiliar home she has rented online. It is pitch black nighttime. It is pouring rain. She is alone in a strange area in a strange neighborhood
She is completely alien to her surroundings.The porch light, the only thing providing illumination within feet of the main character in this moment.While she scrambles around trying to find a key for entry into the home, a light suddenly and mysteriously appears in a front room.She bangs on the door. It opens and a stranger appears.We all know this. It's in the trailer.She eventually enters the home and also eventually warms to the stranger.There are many questions to be answered from here.Why is this stranger already in the home? How did he get here? Why is he here? How much does he know? What are his intentions?I will provide no further details. To do so would be of great disservice. These questions are only the beginning. This is a movie that needs to be seen and experienced inside the theater. It's perfect for the upcoming scary season, colder months, in October, and Halloween.This movie is so not what you think it is.This is the type of film that catches on. And when it does, it will drive audiences wild.Horror has needed a movie like this for a decade, maybe even longer.It's here. This is it.The cinematography of this film is outstanding. The backstory of the characters and the aforementioned environment is laid out in astounding and unexpected detail. This is delightful and electrifying.Writer and director Zach Cregger appears to just be dabbling in the horror genre here.

The sound effects and background music are well-selected. The movements of the camera look nice. The director did a good job of arranging the scenes.

"The first half an hour had an interesting premise. And that's what scary is: you find clues, and are intrigued to find more. Now i was okay with AirBnB fault and all, and also okay if a girl thought to share space with a boy. The movie till that point of time could take any sharp turn, or leap anytime. That was like nail-biting effect, just at the edge of getting goosebumps.And then, it took the most dumbest, idiotic and cliched turn; introduced The Mother. Frankly, after that, every scene, every anxiety to say so, or any sudden jump scare was for the namesake. Seriously, i regret that one hour watching the same script that i had already watched in tonnes of other movies, both good and bad. Every such movie has same story, and this wasn't any different, except the overhype that were already made facade.Three stars for first half an hour, zero for the remaining.",2022-10-30
"This film is classified as a thriller/horror, of which to some extent I'd agree. In all seriousness I thought it was going to be more of a horror which keeps you behind nearly closed eyes throughout the duration.There were/are some moments in the film which gives you that jumpy feeling, but I found the storyline to be a bit distracting as well as touching on the comedy side of things. There are characters that come and then go (Killed off) of which doesn't sit right within the film unfortunately. If this area was tightened up more I feel it would've been more enjoyable.It's not a bad film at all but not one I feel to be recommending in a rush.If you are looking for a scary movie then I would perhaps suggesting looking for something else.",2023-02-19

"BARBARIAN was intense! It's the kind of movie that will have you sleeping with the lights on. The story is about a woman who rents an Airbnb and discovers that the house is not what it seems. Zach Cregger, who wrote and directed it, has created a truly scary movie. For a debut feature film, it's impressive.The acting was great, and the characters were believable. The pacing was perfect, and the suspense was building throughout. The tension in the film is handled expertly and there is a wonderfully unexpected turn in the middle of the story. The camera work was also great, and there are some truly disturbing images in the film. Lighting, special effects, and makeup are all used to create a sense of unease and terror.The core theme is an intelligent one but it's a bit difficult to discuss because I don't want to give too much away. The less you know going in the better. This is a horror movie that is more than just jump scares and cheap thrills. It's a well-crafted film that will leave you feeling disturbed and uneasy. I highly recommend it.",2022-10-24
"When we had seen the trailer for this back in June, my girlfriend and I knew we had to see it. It looked like it would be something worth the watch. So we waited for August 19th and the date was pushed back so we waited again for September 9th and finally got to see it.What we thought was going to just be a jump scare filled horror flick, turned out to be an insanely horrific rollercoaster we couldn't look away from. And I loved every minute of it.Barbarian is a terrifying adventure you have to go into not knowing a thing about. It was the fear of the unknown that really had me going! That said, I know I'll arch it again and still get a kick out of it.Go watch. You won't be disappointed.",2022-09-11

Allow me to explain: Like all films, this one has some good qualities -- excellent setting, lighting, cinematography, acting, etc. The actors really did an amazing job. The creature designs are really good too. My main beef is with the screenplay and these ridiculously high ratings. At a 7 on IMDb I went into this expecting something amazing. Instead what I got for 45 minutes of film was one completely unbelievable scenario after another. No matter how much I stuck with it and tried to suspend disbelief it was almost impossible because the characters were so ridiculously stupid! The story is intriguing and the film does have its moments. When Justin Long is introduces 45 minutes in things do get better, but still. This film deserves far from a 7!",2023-07-19

I know if characters made smart decisions there would be no movie, but this was entirely unbelievable.This movie can only happen because the characters are stupid, which is annoying.It was also not creative in the least.Many things didn't make sense, and it would be correct to say there are plot holes and unfinished plot points- even though these plot points and plot holes are stupid.Overall just stupid.",2022-12-04
"Who wrote this positive reviews? Who rated this so high?..I think young people,teenagers who never watched a solid movie. They think this is peak of cinema. This was barely avarage horror for mainstream audience and its actually insulting.Story is so naive and dumb .Characters act like idiots but not in good way(Coen brothers way) but in irritating and just plain dumb way.This is every other horror movie you've seen. It has all the elements of a typical, stupid horror movie. Unbelievable characters and bland story, cops who behave stupidly and don't respond to reports of kidnapping and murder, and throw in some more slaughter and we've got a ""good movie"". .yeah, right.This is just a copy-paste of other stupid horror movies that are being aired like crazy these days.I still think that a great movie can be made from the horror genre (Alien, Martyrs, The Shining), if not the best, but today's filmmakers prefer to shoot such nonsense to collect easy money.I do not recommend it to anyone.Skip!2/10 just because you can laugh at stupid behavior from characters.",2023-02-25
"1) I can understand why many reviewers disliked this movie. Two reasons for this. First reason, it's because of the hype, they thought that this is a horror masterpiece. I can't blame them because they are right, this is not a horror masterpiece. One should lower his/hers expectations in order for them to enjoy it.2) I enjoy it. The movie is divided in 3 parts. First two parts are scary and intense. Creative and somewhat original. Definitely well-directed and very good acting, especially for a horror movie. It was an 8/10 movie before the third part.3) And now, the infamous final act. The movie changes direction. It becomes campy and loses its identity. It's not scary anymore and there are some comedy elements, or, to be more precise, it doesn't take itself too seriously. And this is the second reason why so many IMDB reviewers and viewers disliked this movie. It's not pure horror anymore, it's not scary, original nor creative. We have seen many times before the final act, at least similar things. I believe this was a bad decision too: Zach Cregger should not change this movie's identity. This could be a great horror movie, provided that they woulh have given us a logical explanation for what happened before and a fitting conclusion. That didn't happen.4) Still, i gave it a high rating for a horror movie. That's because it didn't stop being interesting and intense. Third part was weird and out of place, these were not human characters anymore but superheroes but i still enjoy it. It was a fun ride and i feel the need to reward this movie. Far better acting than the average horror movies, better directing than the average horror movies and, at least, they try something different. It didn't worked as expected in the final act, but that's ok for me.",2023-01-04
"I knew NOTHING except the IMDB score and the one and only sentence written under it.The first half is incredible. Great acting, great framing, mysterious, suspenfull music and actually scary because of it. I was really investeded.Then, a different movie started (for sure a different movie). IMO the story took a nose dive and crashed into a cliff. New character that you are unsure if you should hate or not. Until the very end where you definitely know, but its kinda disjointed with the rest of the story. Decision made by some character are somewhat infuriating (on the edge where I am not sure if its too much). Why is the homeless guy acting like 2 different characters from when we first saw him until the second time? Should we feel bad for the 'villain' at the end? I don't know...
Also, who is fake renting the place? Maybe I've missed somethingTo conclude, first half incredible, second half bad.",2022-11-12

"Easily the best horror film of the year. Barbarian brings all the original and normal tropes to keep the audience entertained like all horror should. But it does something different than most. It literally leads you down a path to where you have no idea what is happening or what is going on. You don't know who is going to make it and who isn't, and you are disturbed at every worse turn. While most horror films are easy to predict ( which isn't always a bad thing, just kind of boring to a point ), Barbarian keeps you guessing even after the film ends. Overall this is a nice fresh peice of horror cinema that any horror fan will enjoy.",2022-11-02
"I'm shocked by the nosedive this film took as it went on. It started off as a well-acted, interesting would-be thriller but oddly shirged into a refreshingly tense horror thriller set in a claustrophobic, genuinely frightening environment that utilized low lighting as well as I've seen in long time.And then the 3rd act came. And we got a generic, eyerolling, physics and common sense defying ""survival"" sequence that just ruined the entire film.I can see how some like this film simply for the jump-and-yell horror qualities or the palpable chemistry between Skaarsgard and Campbell. Had it stayed with that story it would have made a nice little 80-90 minute film that would have been tributes to the talents of 2 fine actors. Instead this movie just never understood what it wanted to be.",2022-11-05
"""Barbarian"" is an instant Horror Cinema Cult in the tradition of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and so many other 70's exploitation releases.You'll never look at an Airbnb the same again after seeing this, this can't be unseen.Georgina Campbell plays the heroine ""Tess"" who gets more than she bargained for on a seemingly routine job hunt in Detroit.When ""Tess"" says ""Nope!"" after a secret door opens I laughed out loud thinking another Director Jordan Peele would approve of this line coming from the mouth of a person of colour in a horror film.She should have stuck with her instinct and ""Get Out"".For an intelligent person she makes some dumb choices...you wouldn't get me back in that house.The Detroit Police reaction to ""Tess"" is clearly a swipe at the US Police after several recent cases including the shooting of an innocent Aussie woman, but doesn't make it any less alarming.Bill Skarsgard is ""Keith"" who gets to utter the immortal line, ""Do I look like some kind of monster?""
And of course we know he was ""Pennywise"" in ""It"", the clown who lured children down to where ""Everyone floats down here"".In fact, the producers behind ""It"" including Bill are backing this film at the box office.Somehow they made this on a shoestring budget of just 10.5 million dollars, so it's already seeing a four fold return on investment.Making its money back on its opening weekend in cinemas and it will sell like hotcakes on BluRay and streaming eventually.Filmed on location in Bulgaria and Detroit the set feels a lot like ""Don't Breathe"" with a backdrop of decaying American suburbia.If you thought Stephen Langs' turn as ""The Blind Man"" in that movie was bizarre wait till you walk out of this screening after meeting Richard Brakes' ""Frank"" in both flashbacks and the present.The ""Barbarian"" soundtrack is limited to only a handful of songs, and it's an eclectic mix including The Ronettes for reasons that will become obvious in the third act.I've been looking for a good horror movie in 2022 and I think I've found it, even though it's more implied than brutal like ""Halloween The End"" and while not as scary, it's very claustrophobic with a few good jump scare and WTAF moments.It's far from perfect, but at least comic actor Justin Long as ""AJ"" adds some light relief to an otherwise unfunny script when valuing his investment property on Barbary Street, even though his flawed character is a piece of work.Great horror needs humour to balance it out!Yin and Yang it's as simple as that.When Jaymes Butler (the ""Shinings'"" Scatman Crothers of this production) as the local derelict ""Andre"" utters the words, ""She's not the worst thing"" you know this movie is leaving itself open to a sequel.I feel we'll be seeing more of 476 Barbary Street.The street name, number and films title are all references to ancient history when the Barbarians invaded Rome.In the end this movie makes you question how much do we really know anyone?""Barbarian"" is a well constructed horror movie for the most part with more layers than an onion.",2022-10-28
"The movie is not bad, ok, but all the inconsistencies and illogical nonsense really ruined it for me. Some things just don't make sense at all and are completely unrealistic and illogical.The scene with the cops is especially annoying. Her car is literally parked there and she fails to mention it? She could have asked them to check her license plate and the cops could find out who she was. The same with the other car.I like the camera work and the atmosphere though. It's very tense. I like the body horror parts as well. Overall, a decent movie and my score would have been higher if they didn't ruin it with poor story writing.",2023-02-11
"Honestly, the writing is not awful... until it is... The first 45 mins is so solid... then it just goes from fun and creepy to kind of goofy.About an hour and 10mins in, its almost salvageable... and then its not... its around that point that the movie just gets to be nonsensical.Someone watched this as a final cut and said ""oh yeah... this is great!"" This makes me really hope that this is the case of a studio re-editing a film before its release.Count the plot holes, and unanswered questions that this movie insisted to introduce in the first place... and you might be more entertained than most. However, my dear horror fans, skip this flick.. even if its free.",2022-11-08
"This movie is worth your time, I had fun watching this. What a really weird, but entertaining horror film. I'd say it was pretty refreshing seeing a movie that didn't need to rely on excessive gore but just the storytelling alone to get your adrenaline going. Great performances by the cast as well, especially by Georgina Campbell, she really delivers a riveting performance, that has you rooting for her all the way through . Visually it looked great, creating a dark ominous atmosphere that left you unsettled from the very beginning, that carries the same tone though out the film. This left you wondering what would next.",2022-10-26
So I've been hesitant to watch barbarian for a while after seeing the trailer few times on tv.. the trailer only gives you like a snippet of information but just enough to keep you interested and that worked. Barbarian really delivered. Horror fans will appreciate this one. I wanna say it's become my favourite horror movie now lol. Highly highly recommend watching on a big screen .. and to go into the movie without knowing much would make the experience worth it. I've never wanted to see a horror movie as many times as I want to see this. Even want to buy it however way I can when it comes out of theatres .,2022-09-10
"This is by far one of the worst ""horror"" movies I've ever seen. The only reason I gave it two stars was because I kinda/sorta liked the acting. The plot was all over the place, not a single character was likable,, and they all made the dumbest possible decisions. For example, in the end while they are trying to get away from the creature, what do they do? They go to the top of a water tower!! There's a scary noise down a really creepy stair case, what do they do? They go investigate it. The girl from the very beginning disappears for two weeks, no one even bothers to look for her, and some how she survived in a pit the whole time and looks pretty much the same. The guy at the end has a whole pointless backstory that just took up time. Don't even bother, it's a complete waste of time.",2023-04-19
"I'm a movie buff and a big horror fan, I'm extremely picky when it comes to what movies I'll watch through and usually will give up 30 minutes to an hour into a movie if it doesn't captivate me.Each weekend I look for a horror movie or 2 to enjoy and usually come out disappointed.I walked into this movie thinking it was going to be another average kidnap, captive torture type horror film but was completely surprised at every turn.I watched this movie on a Tuesday night, after a long days work, which I usually never do and I finished it in 1 sitting.If you are a horror fan please go into this movie without any expectations or reading about it and get ready to be pleasantly surprised!",2022-10-26
"Many previous reviewers have valid complaints. For instance, I live in Las Vegas now, and decades ago I was raised in suburban Detroit. I know that Detroit doesn't have Vegas-like hotel conditions in which an enormous convention books out all of the hotels and forces someone to sleep in her car or whatever. Detroit isn't surrounded by a vast desert--one could easily drive five to ten minutes out of the city and find decent lodging. Also, the supernatural nature of the basement door closing was probably something that threw off everyone. Nothing else in the film was particularly supernatural (presumably). The writer/director should have added a scene in which the monstrous woman's movements caused air currents that caused the door to close. Also, when a panicked person tells me that the strange house I'm renting has a torture chamber in the basement, and she suspects that someone else is living there, I'm not going to say, ""yeah, let's just chill. I want to see it myself.""However, the film's slow build, good timing, good acting and overall good story make it worth watching. There were many moments when I expected to get disappointed by a jump scare, but the film delivers mostly REAL scares, not cheap visual effects. I love that Justin Long's AJ character remained consistent--sometimes comedically so. The ending was satisfying.",2022-10-08
"Went in to watch this without seeing anything besides the poster. I was asking questions through the entire movie. It's trope filled, convenient, boring, dialogue heavy, and over hyped.I don't understand the love for this when you don't see anything in the way of action till the last 15 minutes.Then None of the characters are likeable. The ""monsters"" are boring and tropes. Justin Long makes me feel sad for the future of horror.The story that did make sense was never finished or flushed out. The cops aren't realistic for Detroit. And who on the green earth would buy or vacation rent that house? It's in the second level of hell.And how could Justin Long not find the room during renovations? Ugggggggh.Movies need to be coherent. This is not. It's a mess and just over hyped. Everyone just following along and wanting to be in the cool kids table by liking this movie.I'd say watch it. Don't expect anything fun besides 30 seconds of action at the end.",2023-01-09
"Okay, you possibly will have seen the movie by now and come on here just to see if the reviews correspond to your own opinion.It starts off trying to be clever then 5 minutes later the whole thing takes a nosedive on planetary proportions.The film is just c-r-a-p. Thank goodness I'm using someone else's Disney plus login so at least I didn't waste any money. They just don't make good films anymore.There is no way on earth a double booked person would stay with the other person in an Air b&b Like no way. Before booking anything you would 100% check the area and property reviews. This house was like the only habitable house for miles.I'm just totally ashamed that this film got my attention. And those freakish monster-people in the basement, don't tell me they've been a secret for all these decades. And the tramp, he knew everything. Ugh. Stupid on many levels.Avoid, or at least keep forwarding. Watch it in 20 minutes. And yes, the guy from Jeepers Creepers really is a rapist. Deserves all he gets.",2022-12-15
"Oof people giving this 7-8 stars must be doing it for the comedy factor.I really enjoyed the first half. It was suspenseful. You couldn't figure out whether it was Keith or someone else creeping around the AirBnB.Then.... they discovered the basement dwelling and even that was a little thrilling until they fully revealed the ""hag"" with its giant bosom wanting to have children of its own and sticks its rotten teats in adult men's mouths.I should have known the mere presence of Justin Long and his go to clumsy doofus character was a sign of what would come.The 2nd half of this movie just turns into campy comedy like horror akin to Jeepers Creepers (thanks JL). I'd prefer they'd just gone with that the whole time so I didn't waste and hour thinking I was getting a more nuanced and well written horror.",2022-10-30
"The thing about horror movies, and I am a fan, is they're really not all that great overall. A movie that happens to have horrible things generally causes more horror. This one is alright but I think back to better horror movies and they're really not that great either. So being critical afterwards kinda feels like going on a rollercoaster then complaining that you didn't go anywhere.As to Barbarian, hmmm.. ignore the name. It's as good as any but not like Conan is going to be popping up. A couple things sorta got me thinking there would be ...more. Like if someone said, ""You ain't seen nothing yet"" you'd probably think there was more to see. Here, not so much. I'd keep an eye on the clock and adjust your expectations accordingly. Other parts? Well, sometimes people just have bad dreams I guess. There's some obligatory ""why would you do that again?"" decisions where logical behavior would make for a much shorter movie so okay, fair enough. The actual goings on are less interesting than what it doesn't end up exploring. Such as why certain characters end up having a profoundly bad day while others don't. It's alright but could've been more. Id call it a swing and a miss but it's more like they just bunted and called it good (I think I'm using that metaphor right; not a baseball fan).",2022-10-25
"This could have been a VERY good movie. The scenary was perfect, the atmosphere was perfect and the layers being peeled back on the house were plentiful. Unfortunately, they were never really used.#1: GREAT atmosphere...an almost fully abandoned part of Detroit, a house with several layers as they are unlocked throughout. Sterile inside the house.Problem: They never used the outside for anything, other then viewing and running from what was in the house. Call it misdirection, I call it a horrible use of assets.#2: Who the hell rents an air bnb in the middle of a ghost town? Keith, I understand, he explained, but what about our very forgettable heroin? And she never looked for hotels prior...that was made known in the movie#3: Who has a basement door that self shuts and self locks everytime? I don't...why didn't they unlock it the first time they got locked in?In the end, this movie had alot to offer, but it was delivered in a Little Caesar's Pizza Box. (no offense to those who enjoy a pizza from there).",2022-11-26
"This movie was a surprise for sure. The creative decisions that were made for this film helped keep my attention as I wasn't sure where the story was going. The actors all around did a decent job, especially Justin Long who plays quite the D-word. His character makes up most of the humor for the film and I thought the actor pulled it off well. Georgina Campbell and Bill Skarsgard show good chemistry for the screen time they have together. As far as the antagonist goes, I won't give them away, but they were definitely a highlight of the movie. For cons, I would have to say that by the end it felt incomplete, like there were certain things that weren't fleshed out and too many questions that were left unanswered. The third act was easily the most disappointing as characters make some baffling decisions. While I wouldn't call this movie phenomenal, there were enough elements to carry it through to the end of the runtime. Final verdict: 7/10.",2022-09-19
"My dad and I have been talking lately about why he's lost interest in the horror genre. He's the man who got me interested when I was a kid after all. I'd be in elementary school watching Alien, Scream, Poltergeist - and I loved it. Now I'm the one dragging him into theaters.The recurring reasons I heard were how predictable they've become, how reliant on excessive gore or sex they can be, or - his most damning accusation - how they all somehow feel the same.He's right, about some films. But not all. Year after year some precious gemstones will make their way to the top of my list, especially during the Halloween season, and this year is better than most. I almost can't believe how much fun Barbarian was, partly aided by the fact that I went in totally blind, without even watching the trailer. My god, what a rollercoaster.Casting Bill Skarsgard in the role he plays was genius because for 95% of his presence, I was never convinced he wasn't the big bad. He has this effortless ability to play into uncertainty and keep you on the fence about his intentions. Georgina Campbell is a star in her own right, and I recognized her immediately from Black Mirror; I hope for the industry's sake that she shows up in more films. And Justin Long, a veteran in the scare industry, absolutely crushed his role, but to speak on it would bubble spoilers to the surface. Their performances are sewn together deftly by Zach Cregger, who has never made a feature length film before (shockingly), and, like obvious influencer Jordan Peele, he slices and dices humor and horror in a way that just works. This is so hard to pull off because it's a balancing act - you play up the comedy too much and you lose the edge, but if the jibs aren't funny, they're simply out of place. You'll see how well this works when you punch your ticket.I'm wrapping this up because I really don't want to spoil anything, so the last thing I want to confirm is that Barbarian is SCARY, scary. The dramatic build-up in the first act is legitimately among the most frightening and nerve-shredding sequences I have seen in a decade. The fact that Creggers shifts the tone and brings the tension back whole-heartedly later on is a feat.This is the best horror film of 2022 so far, and it's a whirlwind. I won't be staying in any Airbnbs for awhile.",2022-09-18
"I only expected / wanted something in the quality of a Lifetime Movie. It fell apart because of too many attempted misdirections. They introduced useless characters that went nowhere and they changed the theme.At first it looked like a 'Pacific Heights' and I was okay with that. Then they turned it into 'Descent', and then they introduce a new character who was basically Harvey Weinstein. I actually clicked on 'movie info' multiple times to make certain that I didn't accidentally start a different movie in that transition.I will give this movie two stars for ONE reason. The main character tried going to the police first before plunging into the cavern. I hate the 'dumb people' movie trope. That is when the lead character makes the most illogical decision possible in order to create or prolong danger.This movie is a senseless mess.",2022-10-30
"All I have to say is that this movie ROCKS. I love seeing great horror movies set in my hometown of Detroit, Michigan. Like DON'T BREATH, BARBARIAN reminded me of THE crazy urban legends you hear about in in the D.I don't want to give away ANYTHING about this movie. You're just going to have to see it. I will say that you're in for great performances from a very good cast as well as some great cinematography.This film is a slow burn that really picks up at the midpoint, and you'll be grateful once it kicks in. Its a great, original and unique film that's highly stylized. The ending was fantastic.Just see it. It rules. If you don't find a movie like this to be as fun as I did, well... I'm sorry.

"As the title states for the first hour and abit this film is very decent, has you joked to know where you TS going and gets fairly eerie through out. But then after this point it just goes up very rushed and as if it was filmed by college students. If you have seen the film ""X"" with Kid Cudi, then you will get what I mean. All in all I would say to anyone to give it a watch as the first part is good enough for any type of suspense film but then just be prepared for it to fall away quickly. If you go in with that in mind you won't be too disappointed in it. Really this film is about a 5.5 out of 10.",2022-12-05
"Definitely not the best horror, actually, this was a bad horror and don't understand the great reviews.This was another pointless and meaningless movie, which seems to be the trend lately. Basically, there was no story, just random characters who end up in the wrong place, at the wrong time running away for being chased by some crazy person or entity for an unexplained reason. Silly dialogue, performance was solid, a few horror scenes, that none made me jump out of my seat . As for the evil character, not sure I got this right, was she a super being ?Pls Hollywood, appreciate to make horror movies that got a good plot, and not pointless.",2022-11-01
"I didn't understand the high ratings on such a poorly executed film. So I had to share in telling the truth.This is a great concept (the mistakenly shared Air Bnb) that ends up having the worst script come out of it.If you want a horror film, please go elsewhere. If you want some social commentary, please seek better attempts. The only thing going for this is the actress at the center, and even she is wasted in this.If you think a horror movie consists of using the same set piece many times over (while it gets decreasingly scary as you care less and less about what's ""down the dark hall""), or a loud, screaming character that makes no sense (but is also not scary) this is for you.It was a huge miss for me. (It honestly felt like a rejected piece from 2020 that got thrown together and pushed into distribution)
Don't waste your time. No scares. Not something to think about. Just scrambling down a long dark hall, looking for a point.",2022-11-03
"My friends hyped me up for this one, ""Did you hear? People leave the theater shaking!"" Close. I almost left the theater...early :D The movie went from good to bad after the first half.I love the premise of strange things happening at an Airbnb. As a fellow Airbnber, I was hooked from the start. Bill Skarsgård's (Pennywise) character came in with them EYES and charming face. He was friendly, then he was weird, then really nice, an innocent victim of happenstance, wait...that was creepy. Is he good or bad? I couldn't figure him whether to trust him or not, it was brilliant ! That's about it. The best parts of the movie were in Act 1 (spoiled in the trailer, so avoid it).The monster was not scary, more like...unattractive & a little offensive 😂 They took one of the most beautiful and sacred things in life and made it look nasty. Credit for making me sympathize with the monster because the thing it needed the most is something we all crave and it's not a monstrous thing at all. But there was not enough background or explanation for this creature- just seems like a prop to the movie.Justin Long's character was annoying (probably purposeful). Thanks for a laugh or two but is it bad that I want the monster to ""eat you"" already? Unfortunately, he remains front and center for a long time.Georgina Campbell's acting: 'Yes, you're acting.' :,) Her character was likable when she presented herself as relatable... and then she starts doing the things you hate about horror movie characters: she puts herself in danger several times so that ...so that what? Out of curiosity (..she wants a selfie with the monster). Jk. She wants to save strangers y'all !! Her ""kindness"" seemed all so forced like the writers just needed her to be the hero and to prove it over and over again. I need to know why she's radically selfless- what about her past made her this way?-More unanswered Qs: what is it with this neighborhood? Who is the man in the black hoodie that keeps popping up? What happened with the whole Airbnb ordeal? Was it staged? Who is managing it and why aren't they doing anything? I could go on and on but that's enough for now. With the premise alone, the movie had so much potential. But I'm left with the impression that it's just another one of those bad, seasonal horror movies because they need some to come out around Halloween.",2022-10-31
"The answer to the title will never been known.The first act was creepy and suspenseful but then it was cut short in one foul swoop and from the moment justin long appeared the movie went down hill quickly. I actually thought it jumped to a different movie.A door closes but no one knows why or how.I am still wondering why its 18 rated aswell.Is it scary definitely NOT.So many things in this movie were unexplained, leaving the story, oh sorry wait what story?A creepy ghost feeling starts the movie off but then strange things happen with out knowing why.Why would a house be in perfect condition amongst a run down mess of a place? This is just one of many questions unanswered.",2022-11-12
"Zach Cregger's Barbarian is a masterclass in building tension and suspense, and presenting payoffs in the form of well-crafted scares. Surprisingly, we also get to know just about enough about the film's lead characters including the antagonist. Almost every cliché associated with films featuring the ""terror in the basement"" trope is neatly subverted. We also get a great ""final girl"" performance from Georgina Campbell, which doesn't exactly turn out the way you might expect. The first act sets up the premise, with the mystery surrounding Bill Skarsgård's character. But by the end of it, you are left with even more questions. Justin Long's grey-shaded character is a standout too, with his ""grey-shadedness"" constantly wavering, keeping his stance interesting to watch out for at all times.Also, credit should go to art department for creating that abandoned suburbian neighborhood setting, which adds so much to the atmosphere and aura of the refreshingly original plot. The flashback sequence that takes place as we get to the finale is more of a quick insight than a spoonfeeding device, and viewers will still need to connect some of the dots themselves. Cregger's craftsmanship truly shows in the way he executes the scenes set in the creepy basement, with claustrophia catching up as characters make their way through narrow, dark, and dingy tunnels. I love the way he sketches the characters played by Campbell and Long. Anna Drubich's score is effective in the sense that it knows when to be silent and when to accentuate a scary scene.",2022-10-25
"Barbarian has many problems and uses some horror tropes that I just dislike, and I'm not so sure about its rewatchability because the first hour has many baiting moments, BUT (and that's a big but) when it's good, it's great and it was so enjoyable to watch that I can easily say that I witnessed a new cult classic in the likes of Evil Dead. There are so few times in recent years that you can say that a director went the distance and after Barbarian I can shout that Zach Cregger went there. He went there and did that! ""What's that?"" you ask. Well watch the movie to find out.Also, huge congratulations to the editor of the first trailer because the beautiful magician managed to craft a perfect teaser without showing you absolutely nothing.",2022-10-26
"Honestly not a bad movie at all. If you are reading the reviews, the obvious general consensus is that the beginning of the movie was great and the ending sucks. And although that is completely true, I do still think it was worth the watch. The first half of the movie was extremely intriguing and suspenseful to say the least, especially if you watched the trailer and only the trailer before hand (no other spoilers).Acting was great, climax was corny at times, cinematography was very well done with some really interesting shots, and overall plot was an interesting concept for a majority of the film at least...If you are considering watching this movie, do it, you will not regret your decision.",2023-07-19
"Honestly, this is the scariest movie I have seen in decades. I had not seen any trailers, had no idea what ""Barbarian"" was about. As the plot thickened, I became more and more nervous till I practically could not move. The thing about it was that everything was logical - it was a plausible plot. You could see where something like that could happen.There are totally unpredictable premises which I have never seen in any movie. I prefer not to tell you what they are, because then you would not experience the intensity of the surprise the way I did. Believe me, they are unique.This is a terrific horror flick. Thank you, brilliant filmmakers, for taking my mind off everything else in the world.",2022-09-14
"I saw an advance screening of Barbarian Wed. 9/7/22 at AMC Lowes by the Boston Common. I went into the theatre expecting a horror-thriller as it was billed as such on IMDB/ Rotten Tomatoes. This was far more of a horror-comedy.The acting was solid. The laughs were well-executed. The plot was anything but predictable. I felt entertained but I did not get the thrill I was looking for from a movie in the thriller/horror genre.It was not in any way ""scary"". This film pokes fun at the horror genre and doesn't take itself too seriously. If it's properly billed as a horror/comedy, I would rate this film higher.",2022-09-08
"Barbarian is beyond what is in its trailer. It's brilliantly constructed, it's unpredictable, Justin Long and Georgina Campbell pack in rock solid performances- with extra special gold stars to Justin Long- he brings so much to the table nailing every scene he is in. Zack Cregger's direction is just brilliant. With true feeling of dread, or feeling of relief, he constructs every scene beautifully. While the ending is probably not as good as I was hoping, the rest of the film all the way up to the ending is an incredible joyride. This is a fun fun movie.The editing of the movie is super tight. The cinematography and production design are brilliant. The film absolutely shines in every sense of the word.",2022-09-12
"Please do not waste your time on this movie! In my opinion it is very slow, boring garbage! It starts off not too bad then goes completely off track and stupid. I very rarely give poor ratings as peoples opinions vary so much, one man's meat is another man's poison as they say, but this film has no redeeming features even the title is not relevant to the movie. I am surprised any named actor would take part in this if they read the script! So disappointed as it could of been better and had potential even though there was nothing new in the story. Sorry to rattle on but very hard to find enough to say to reach the character length required!",2022-12-16
"With movies like Nope, 2022 has been a pretty good year for horror movies. Pretty good since we have gotten a few disappointments. I wasn't expecting much when I first heard of this movie, but this is surprisingly a creepy movie. Barbarian is a pretty fun horror movie where its set in a hotel and has surprises along the way. Yeah, there are some moments here that shows it can be more creepy than scary. But the execution would help make the movie a fun thriller with a good plot that connects well to its setting, nice editing that would fit with horror elements and great characters that would serve purpose of events that would be going on. If you guys are horror movie fans, this would be worth watching. However, you must know what you'll get from this movie since like I just said, the barbarian creature herself can be more creepy. I wouldn't consider this the scariest movie I've seen, but this movie has given me a reminder that I wouldn't want to rent that house, and that's the movie's true purpose.",2022-10-28
"I am appalled by the high scores this film is getting, and i fail to get the reason.The film starts off promising, good hints, no jumpscares, good music. We do not get to know the chatacters, but it feels okay. Then suddenly we jump to a very lighthearted sequence, and it drags on and on, erasing any feeling of thrill we had. Then the stupidity begins, very stupid escapes, very stupid reason to go back and save a person you knew for 3 seconds, bad monster design wgich makes no sense at all, 40 years is not enough time to cause such a mutation, horrible thought, a very cheesy ""am i good or bad"" monologue by a character that we dont care about, and a very cheesy running away scene that destroys any backing that monologue might have had... Dont waste your time.",2022-11-16
"The horror of 'Barbarian' lies in the suspense that's created. Right from the get-go, the whole situation between Tess and Kieth feels off, and I found myself sitting there anxiously waiting to see if this was gonna turn into some kind of psycho killer kidnapping a girl type of movie. But just when the viewer thinks things are gonna go one way, the film throws a curveball.This movie has really good cinematography and lighting, especially during the tunnel scenes (you'll see) which are atmospherics and will make you nervous. Also, the music is awesome and contributes to that sense of dread. Our final girl, Tess, makes some really silly and frustrating decisions at times but hey, if you're willing to overlook that, you'll enjoy the movie. Once a big reveal happens, the monstrous villain is shown, and 'Barbarian' turns from a suspense-fueled film into a more standard popcorn flick, honestly. Another cool thing about it is how the story revolves around a few main characters, the narrative shifts so we get to spend a little time with each one, and then their stories are tied together. Sort of an unconventional way of approaching this kind of stuff, so I appreciated that.This is the type of movie I'd think would go straight to Shudder. Good, fun, pretty solid overall. It is even creepier in its more subtle, psychologically-driven moments as opposed to its louder, in-your-face moments, in my opinion. I'd be interested if there were a prequel revolving around Richard Brake's character and what went down in the house decades prior to the events of this movie.",2022-09-11
"A 1 star rating is too high for what this movie deserves, I genuinely can't believe this has such high ratings.It had a very solid and interesting start, but after the first half, the plot didn't make sense at all and neither did the characters, it just kept going on and on without giving any explanation about what was actually happening, I was too confused and didn't have a break to process anything at all. Too many things happening in such a short period of time.Halfway through it almost seemed like i was watching an entire different movie. An extremely slow development for a very empty ending.Two hours I'll never get back.",2022-11-07
"First 15 minutes I thought I knew what was going to happen. Wrong. Then next 10 minutes. Wrong. Then 15 minutes after that. Wrong! What tension you can create with a mirror and a light bulb, bravo!While this is not the scariest movie I've ever seen it had its moments. The acting was really good for a horror film. The light humor in certain scenes had me laughing out loud. I liked the pacing of the movie and it blew by very quickly. I wanted more!This movie won't win any awards but it should be on the watch list for horror fans. Way better than most movies that came out this year. Watch and enjoy!",2022-10-26
"First of all, let me start by saying that I enjoyed this movie and none of the plot holes ruined the experience for me. But there are several issues, and my review is just to point them out from a logical point of view:The first time something weird happens, when the main protagonist awakens because of the floor creaking and finds the bedroom door open, and sees the dude making weird sounds while asleep on the couch, along with us seeing the basement door close in the background, of course that was the creepy mother coming out as she does at night, so if she is so aggressive at night when she comes out, even later to venture out of the house to try and take people back, why would she not have done anything that first night when we hear the floor creak and the door was ajar? There was obviously no shame in her game as we saw later in the movie, so why would she not have done anything to the defenseless sleeping people that she definitely saw in the house when she came out? Also how did she get out of the basement at all then, and later on, when the door locks and can only be opened from the outside? That's the first thing that doesn't make sense to me.The second thing that doesn't make sense to me is if the home was listed on Airbnb and HomeAway, wouldn't the protagonist have seen poor reviews from other guests about the area? You could say, oh well the other people who stayed there were captured/killed by the crazy mother lady, so they couldn't leave reviews, well okay then do those other people not have relatives and friends that would file a missing persons report? That knew they were staying in that home? Traces of their transaction on these websites? The home was never investigated in the past? I mean if they would have gone into the police arriving and not caring or checking into it, which also doesn't make sense on its own, and explained that by saying the town police were aware of the lady and a literal serial killer living down there, and they were covering it up or had some agreement with them, then that would have been explained for sure in the story, right? I just don't think that was very well thought through. Also, almost none of it would have happened if the protagonist did the most realistic thing possible from the beginning, not stay in the home with a stranger, and definitely not venture deep into a potentially dangerous underground shaft/tunnel to find said stranger versus leaving and bringing the police back with her. I liked the movie and enjoyed it, but those elements made it feel amateur in its writing. Still a very good time, and I'm glad to have given it a shot.",2022-10-27
Firstly I really do not know why there is so much hype surrounding the movie. There is nothing special about the movie due to which I will recommend this to anyone and neither is this worth a second time watch. The writing/screenplay is stupid with massive plot holes and irritating characters who you do not connect to and do not care about. Do not recall how many times I did an eye-roll after a scene. It was painful to watch and seriously do not recommend this to anyone. Started off well and had some promise and then the wheels come off. No idea why the movie was titled barbarian. The movie is supremely disappointing if you consider the horror element of which there is none.,2022-12-10
"Barbarian was the most horrifying, terrifying, and genuinely the most disturbing film I've had the pleasure in viewing in cinemas in I can't remember how long.Bill Skarsgard was absolutely brilliant as expected, Georgina Campbell was also great they both bounced off each other very well and the rest of the cast performed just as well.The story, the writing, score, and sound design is superbly done. It all comes together to make for some great disturbing imagery and moments. My only real problem with this film is the subplot with Justin Long's character AJ I didn't care to much for it and I genuinely wanted to get back to what was happening in the house. But it all came together very well for a nice pay off.I would encourage anyone who would call themselves horror fans and watch this one in cinemas because films like these don't happen often enough and it deserves your money.IMDb: 8/10
Letterboxd: 4/5Watched in Theaters.",2022-10-05
"This movie is a product - essentially a marketing ploy leveraging the recent (but already tired) trope of 'not too scary' horror movies + having the guy who played the clown from ""IT"" == box office.Undoubtedly, it's very well acted. Justin Long is PERFECT in the role he's given here and I haven't seen him doing so well since ""idiocracy"". And Campbell fills the shoes of the 'sane person in a mad world' perfectly.The movie is also relatively well directed, even though at times the CGI is very evident and the constant focus length shift, some extreme (fisheye is used extensively throughout), are getting really tiring quickly.So what's wrong with this movie? Well, someone wise once said a movie is about 3 things: ""the script, the script and the script"". And this is where ""barbarian"" fails. Sure, there's an interesting '2 movies into one' angle which has already been done to death (Pulp Fiction anyone? Or any GoT season for that matter). But overall, it makes very little sense, and commits the act to not to be consistent to rules that were established earlier in the movie.In fact, nothing is established, except for the interaction between ""mr IT clown"" and Campbell, which is supposed to trick you in on direction while pushing you off a cliff in the other. But despite Long's amazing acting effort, it just... well it doesn't work.The back story is plain jane, and only Detroit locals will chuckle at the auto-derision and references to the city's glorious past and gloomy present.Successfully delivering a failed concept is no success - sadly this a two. Neither scary not intriguing. Just - boring with a good bit of acting from Long.",2023-01-07
"Small scale by design, this plot-twisty thrill ride is a great watch for one big reason: it's fun. This is escapist stuff that is just perfect for the creep factor, some well-placed jump scares and actually some laughs. Pretty cool that Zach Cregger, known primarily for his comedic writing is at the helm. He pivoted to the horror genre here, and developed characters more deeply and realistically than we usually see. Also Skarsgard, Campbell and Long are just perfect in their assignments.Barbarian punches above its weight class, and I recommend watching it without having any knowledge of the plot beforehand.",2022-09-09
"I went into this film without watching a single trailer and the first two acts of the film were such a delightful journey. It was very exciting to guess and think possible answers and the first act ends very explosively in unexpecting way. From there on, the movie slows down a little bit which is quite refreshing but as we go through the final act, it just doesn't quite deliver the way I wished. Generally, the movie doesn't build up upon the mystery that well and rather leaving things to watcher ficure out (which it kinda does but not in a right way atleast in my opinion), it feels like we're left with not enough explosition to be pulled into the story. The tension is definitely lower in the last act than in rest of the movie, it's by no means a bad ending but the more I think about it, less impressive it becomes.Acting is overally quite good and few times the main character's actions left me scratching my head, but mostly this movie avoids annoying cliches where the main character is acting incredibly dumb, which I really appreciate. But in the end, for me this is just a one-time enjoyable watch. It's like a horror movie made by A24 but missing their signature elements to elevate this movie higher. 6.5 would be my final rating for this and I do recommend to watch this, it's definitely very fitting and just a good movie for Halloween.",2022-10-30

"I thought this was going to be just a straight ""Horror"" movie... and I guess it was? Though maybe it was kind of a mystery/thriller? I'm not sure. But, sure, it was definitely horror and I enjoyed it. Then I thought about it afterwards, thinking, was there more of something that was going on, and how quite far does this rabbit hole go. I wanted to know more, and since this is an original film (I assume), I'm kinda hoping for a little more.Now there were some dialog scenes that dragged on a bit too long, and one scene near the end felt a tad bit campy (I feel it could have been a lot more dramatic with a strong horror flare/element... at leat a different camera angle), but hey, it is what it is.Now it was anything like the movie Malignant, it just gave me that kinda feel. Maybe the trailer was just way off from how I precieved it. But this was different, and I enjoyed a a whole bunch!",2022-09-15
"Barbarian is what you get when you unsuccessfully try to mix Hatchet and The Hills Have Eyes. It starts out promising enough, with a pseudo 'Is this guy a serial killer's style film, but devolves into a half cooked third act that goes off the rails but not in a good way. I understand wanting to take a unique direction in horror, and with some tweaks maybe Barbarian would have knocked it out of the park, but what we get just doesn't satisfy my horror tooth. Let's also get a big thing out of the way, if you're going to call your horror film Barbarian it damn well better deliver on the carnage candy, which this film does not. Give me Adam Greens Hatchet series anyway, at least it does what it promised.",2022-09-18
"Uhhh yeah I could barley watch it. It really built tension at the beginning. I didn't know anything about this movie and I honestly was at the edge of my seat not knowing what was gonna happen.The only thing I knew about it was that Jeremy Jahns said it was the best resident evil movie he's seen. That's all I needed to know. No it's not connected to that IP at all but yes it's in that wheelhouse in my opinion.There were some choices at the end that didn't sit right with me and I'm not exactly sure what the writer/director had in mind for the message behind certain themes but it was very well made. So for that, cheers movie you got a 8/10 from me.",2022-09-10
"This movie resurrected the hillbilly horror and added to the premise and the plot! Great acting, Justin Long lovely presence makes u even more drawn to the movie. Unexpected twists and perfect writing. Not all horrors are present on the screen and the movie gives a rare window to the viewer to imagine a kidnapping story line. I loved it from beginning to end. Whatever you expect is not going to happen!!!! Very fresh take and incredible plot that successfully avoided cliches on modern horror.One last thing, if you are a faint of heart, watch it during the day, this is an unsolicited honest advice ...",2022-10-27
"Zach Cregger is the most recent director to transition from comedy (The Whitest Kids U'Know) to horror, smoothly orchestrating savvy camerawork and vividly presenting his authentic ideas. But perhaps the most extraordinary thing he accomplishes by the end of the film is making the audience sympathize with the monster threatening to kill the central characters. The film was cleverly paced, making the 102 minute run time fly by without causing any sort of fatigue. They frequently switched points of view, placing you in the middle of a new narrative that somehow intertwined with the primary plotline. I was a big fan of the cast, namely Justin Long, who played a despicable actor accused of a heinous crime and thrust into a horrific situation. The film's first act gradually builds up the tension, and the final two acts drive it home with a morbidly satisfying payoff. The story was sick, twisted, and innately disturbing on a subsurface level, which makes me wonder how Cregger plans on topping it in his next film in his blossoming directorial career.",2022-10-11
"How are people raving about this film, I was bored from start to finish, complete waste of my time. Not sacry or jumpy in the slightest like the trailers make out, infact just watch the trailer that's the only good bits of the film.Justin long must be struggling at the moment to take that role. His character dosent even fit in the film properly, I thought the film had switched to something else when he is introduced.This is one of the first times I've left a cinema and contemplated asking for my money back. Infact this is the first time a film was so bad I wanted to leave a review.It's not even a film that's so bad it's good like some horrors it's just terrible.",2022-11-04
"Unlike most films these days, the first trailer for this did not spoil the entire movie. That alone is a major accomplishment sadly.The film itself one one hell of a ride! It builds up great tension, has humor sprinkled in, and had multiple ""woah did not see that coming"" moments. Its mystery unravels overall in a captivating way with great pacing. The acting was good from all the leads and some of the camerawork was really cool. I also appreciated the commentary on men and fitting genders into broad categories for better or worse...This is probably one of those films that loses its effect after first viewing in terms of rewatchability but if you happen to catch it in theaters, it's a great time.",2022-09-11
"The first half or so of this movie is actually really good. It was very subtle and nuanced, and kept getting creepier and creepier. I found myself guessing what would happen, who was evil, etc, to no avail.Somewhere around the halfway point, it just kinda went off the rails. I think my biggest disappointment is that this didn't have to be a supernatural type movie. It would have worked just as well...no, better even, if the monster were more humanlike and less...superhuman creature they turned it into. There were a few scenes you have to kind of suspend belief for, and that to me ruined what could have been a knockout creepy movie.",2023-08-22
"The only way for me to review - and remember - this movie, is to do spoilers, so if you don't want to know, stop reading.For me, it felt like the film played in three different parts. The first sees a young woman renting a house. The second introduces us to the house's owner. The third shows the horrible deeds the original home owner did that lead to the events in the first part.Georgina Campbell stars as the film's protagonist, Tess. Arriving at a house she just rented online, she is devastated when she finds the house has been double-booked, and is occupied by Kevin (Bill Skarsgard). Not sure what to do given the circumstances, he offers for her to stay. The house is located in Brightmoor, which is not a good area and almost all the other homes in the area are dilapidated. Predictable movies would have him be the titular barbarian, as I initially thought, but this being an unpredictable movie, it was not the case.This first part was just as creepy and nerve-wrecking as 'The Descent'. There was a constant foreboding atmosphere. What evil lurks in the darkness? Well, just like 'The Descent', 'Barbarian' is about to show you! I so enjoyed this first part, and then suddenly - just when you're on the edge of your seat biting your nails - BAM!, they cut to a guy driving a sports car, singing along to blaring music. This is AJ (Justin Long), the owner of the houseImmediately, the suspense made way for a much lighter tone - almost comedic - and a guy being accused of rape and the risk of losing everything. His wealth management representative warns him he'll be out of money within 3 months, so he goes to the house in Brightmoor to sell it. Arriving there, he notices the house is being rented out, without his knowledge. Luckily, the suspense returns when he goes to the basement, where he discovers the secret tunnels.The third part shows us the house's previous owner, Frank. He used to abduct women for sexual acts, and kept them locked up in the basement. This, off course, explains the film's events. I must say I found the cops to be real idiots, and their behaviour unrealistic and almost comic relief stupid.The creature effects were creepy and very well done. Georgina Campbell delivered a very good performance, and the film ultimately indeed had that 'The Descent' feel to it (only, 'The Descent' was a far more superior movie). The ending to 'Barbarian' reminded me a bit of 'Mama'. 'Barbarian' is a well made movie and I'm sure horror buffs will have a good time with it. In time, I'm just not sure I'm going to associate the movie with its title. Who was the Barbarian? Was it Frank, or was it Mother?'Barbarian' is well worth a watch.",2023-03-11
"This was so boring and slow.This was all kinds of boring, very, very, very, very slow moving, nothing scary happened but some violence at around 42mins, a hilarious moment where we witness the longest tape measure ever, some lazy dumb cops, a hilarious moment where a man is beaten with his own arm, and then nothing.The end of the movie arrived so fast but still was not soon enough. Difficult story to understand, seemed almost random and I have to keep writing more about this movie to meet the character limit for reviews which is absurd and unnecessary but only 29 characters left to go, 321 done.",2023-05-11
"Full disclosure: YES, there are some scenes that have minor holes in them, but even the very very best movies do too. There is no perfect movie with the exception of Citizen Kane and The Godfather.That said, this movie rocks. It's basically set up in three parts. The first third is the most thrilling and when it's over you will say WTF? Loudly.There are so many twists and turns you'll think you're on a ride at Coney Island. True, you'll also be asking -- why is the character not running or why are they doing this or that. That's par for the course. Just go with it and and stay on the roller coaster. It's worth it.There are several WTF scenes which makes this a completely original movie. It trully is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long time.Well made and thoroughly enjoyable.",2022-11-19
"First of all, I loved how the whole thing changed and we got the plot.In the beginning I don't think nobody trusted Keith and I really thought he was a partner for what's going on until he dies. So that was a major shock to me. Can we argue who on earth would go through that dark and very deep tunnel? Sure. Should we? I don't think so. If you're really concerned about right decisions then I don't think horror movies are your thing.Job interviewers comment on the neighborhood was a nice touch.Not gonna lie tess gave me headaches with her choices but I liked how AJ ended up. And it was kind of touching to see how sentimental ""she"" is. It's a scary movie for sure. Not just jump scares but the atmosphere. It really makes you nervous and crawled.One of the few things I didn't like is that the movie could've more layers. They kind of wasted a very good backstory. I'd prefer to see a lot more of it than Tess' dumb choices. Also, there could be much more disturbing scenes with AJ and the mother. But anyways.",2022-10-26
"I love and adore Bill Skarsgard, so his face and name will gain my attention every time - but I am so upset with the direction his character was taken.What in the world did I just watch!?!? They lost me right after the words ""something but me"" ... why??? Just why??? Yes, there are some laugh out loud moments. Yes, there is some gore. But it is intentionally trying to convince you of things that don't align with what's really going on. Trying to trick the audience is quite different than actually being clever. This movie toys with you, because it tries so hard to be groundbreaking and set itself apart. It fails. It is not even a so bad it's good movie ... it's just so bad it's actually bad!!!I love and support the horror genre, but I cannot stand behind this AT ALL. This movie is not good. It was not anything that people ""think"" it is. You've been duped.I'll never forgive this script for what it did to Bill. Horrible plot. The subplot with Justin Long is the only part that was funny.

I honestly wouldn't even class this as a horror.. after watching it I thought it had cut out half way through because how terrible the plot is.

This one is no different.Ever since Halloween back in the 80s we have seen the monster/murderer wake up after it should have been dead, so you just wait for that.It is time for creators to be creative and not to base their movies on older movies that has been done thousands of times before.",2022-10-30

If you are a seasoned veteran then you won't find this to be terrifying in the least. You won't even find it all that original. I was expecting some kind of big reveal, some kind of jaw dropping, unexpected twist as the movie moved into the third act but......I was left disappointed.Fine camera work and acting and enough tension to make it enjoyable enough but a 7.6 (current rating)?

"Once again an audience screaming trailer hyped up another dull horror film with the weakest jump scares I've seen in a long time. This could have been great but offers nothing.The actors do a great job but in the end are let down by pretty much nothing happening, we get a glimpse at a back story to what's happened in the past but that's all, just a glimpse.As for the police officers in the film, the less said about how unbelievable they are the better.Plus side, there are some good sfx and the make up is done well
I was looking forward to this film but it falls way short of even being a slightly good film
Save your selfs the time and money and go watch something else.",2022-11-01
"Barbarian is great. It might just well be the best horror movie of 2022. The first 40 minutes are perfectly executed and the suspense builds and builds.Georgina Campbell is great as the heroine and carries the movie well first with Bill Skarsgard and then with Justin Long. ""The Mother"" is a creepy creature design and has some gross out moments.Barbarian is 1hr 42m but moves along at a brisk pace and i didn't feel the running time at all. I actually wish maybe more was set in the 80s section of the movie and some more backstory was provided.The movie never tops it's first half but there is a lot to like here and i wouldn't mind diving into this underground again for a sequel or even a prequel.",2022-10-25
"Not sure where this high score is coming from, but it's certainly not deserved.Although the start of the movie shows some promise, very quickly you start shouting at the main character (why go in there? Why go back? Why are you such a fool?) and it only gets worse.The 2nd part is just a continuation of silly decisions and unrealistic events. You get no explanation on why happens what happens and the end tops it with the obvious story line (you'll never guess who survives and who doesn't)One of the worst scary movies out there, so save your time and go re-watch your favourite scary movie.",2022-11-04
"The only positive thing about watching this movie is that I burned a nice amount of calories watching it while on my treadmill.I had no idea what to expect with this movie. It took about thirty minutes before it caught my interest and had me curious as to what the heck is going on.I was questioning a few things as the movie went on and then when I looked to see that there was ten minutes left I thought there is no way that this movie is going to be able to have a worthwhile resolution with what little time is left.If you are looking to watch a movie for a bit of a scare and a somewhat interesting plot, do not look here.----- spoiler-----
When the guy pushed the girl off the water tower/silo, whatever it was, and then the crazy woman jumped off after her.... did anyone question why when the guy came down to the ground the crazy woman was underneath the woman that he pushed off the silo?",2022-10-30
"What's confounding, is how a film that's so well directed and written can lose all sense of dread it built in a matter of minutes.It's true that all horror movies struggle with their endings. I'm fact both comedies and horror movies struggle with their endings.But this film does such a wonderful job of keeping you on the edge of your seat that it's frustrating that half way through they change the tone of the film. We start with terror and zero comedy but by the end, the director intentionally introduces a character so stupid that you can't help but laugh/roll your eyes at his stupidity. And we aren't taking ignorant. We are talking full blown dumb blond level of stupid.By the final act, there's even a classic comedy joke ""it'll never find us in here...""
*creature bursts through the wall.It was meant to be a joke but why? Why make the film funny at all? Was the filmmaker too afraid to just be a horror film?Simple Suggestions:Keep the first half and rewrite the villain and second half. Remove the weird monster story that makes no sense. In fact, take out all the fantastic plot elements and just have a straight up serial killer be behind it all.That alone would have vastly improved this film.",2022-12-13
"I saw an early screening of this and I really enjoyed it. Honestly Georgina, Bill, and Justin do amazing jobs in their roles and the movie wouldn't be great without them. This movie will NOT be enjoyable for those who cannot handle gore or a lot of violence, but if you're a horror fan and do then this movie is for you. After seeing the movie I felt nauseated which is a good sign that it was very disturbing more than ""scary"". I do think that this movie has a deeper meaning within the main horror aspect which was interesting to see. I'd say this is one of my favorites up there with the conjuring because it genuinely did terrify me. My only critique is that I wish Bill Skarsgård had more screen time because I liked his character and Georgina's chemistry.",2022-09-08
"I dont know how its get 7 ... people becoming without mind or they just like the unprofessional directors and writers ... this movie not scary actually its Extremely provocative and an infinite amount of stupidity... Unbelievable, the way of acting and performance... Makes you feel that people are so stupid that you are the smartest in the world... The actions of all the actors are hideous... Synopsis: Some idiots want to die in any way, even death He doesn't want them ... if u didnt lestin to me and watch it .. when in the last 10 minutes after the homeless man died then come here and like my comment hahahahah ... even the police is stupid more than ever in this movie ... everything is a disaster in the movie even the end ...",2022-11-24
They must have got the whole film crew families cousins and neighbors to rate this for it to be at 7.5 this is nothing more than amateur horror film and a lot of the things don't make sense especially the cops not caring to take a look and the ending is ridiculous anyway if you want to waste some time give it a watch.I cannot see how this can get over a five score since it's very amateurish and many dumb mistakes are made by the characters which make you believe that it's nonsense. If the police would have at least given a crap about finding the young lady then maybe but they totally misrepresented our law enforcement.,2022-10-30
"Let me get right to it, Barbarian is a film that is *very* well made from a filmmaking perspective, but the script is too complex for its own good, it winds up losing track of what it aims to convey to the audience, and eventually fails because of this.This will be a brief review because i dont want to risk spoiling a film that you're still in time to catch.The acting, dialogue, direction, photography, etc - everything that deals with production - was VERY good. If you are interested in filmmaking, then absolutely, watch Barbarian.The script was complex and, reasonably interesting, but it changes tone through the movie, and at once point forgets that there's an audience out there that wants to be entertained.Barbarian could have easily been saved. A few cuts, a few minor edits, and you would have had a successful film. But as it is now, i cannot recommend this. You don't want to be in that situation where you start getting into the film, and then 10 minutes later you are thinking ""wth am i watching?"", which is exactly what Barbarian does to you.My vote: 5.5/10.",2022-11-01
"At least save your money and wait for it to come out on Redbox. I want to give it a 6, and that's only because the first act of the movie was good, which is sad because the movie had potential. Once they meet the lady in the dungeon things start to go downhill. After writing the review I realized the movie as a whole doesn't really deserve a 6.I understand that in many horror movies the movie would be over in less than 30 minutes if people used common sense so they have to make the characters do stupid things to keep the movie going.However, this is way too much.The lack of investigation into the double booking of the Air BNB, the inability to find a hotel, even if it means going to another city and a few other plot holes don't help either.The super human lady, who is super human for no reason also makes no sense. There's no demons posessing her, even though she looks like the woman(monster) from the move ""Quarantine"", stolen government technology or anything else that explains how she's able to rip a man's arm off, fall at least 50 feet, and completely recover in the span of a few minutes.Yes, she literally ripped a man's arm off and beat him with it. It also looked like she cracked another guy's skull open.Going into this movie blind, which is suggested, doesn't help.",2022-11-09
"Now, I am not the biggest horror movie fan out there. I don't gleefully wait for Halloween movies or talk in detail about the old horror franchises. Occasionally, I will check out a movie that doesn't seem to fall into the usual tropes of the genre. So Barbarian looked interesting to me, and the first half of the movie certainly got my attention, but then Justin Long shows up.I don't hate Justin, but dang his appearance just took the air out of the movie. While some people didn't mind the left turn he brought to the proceedings, I think adding him in just created a major tonal shift that turned me off to the movie. It seemed the moment he showed up, the entire movie just lost its way.I wasn't particularly fond of the reveal as well. I was hoping it would be something more grounded and real rather than surreal and pedestrian. What looked like a potential modern look at urban horror morphed into a predictable horror movie.The only thing I can really give credit to is the settings and the attention to detail these settings had. They were really engrossing and interesting, but it was too bad they couldn't create a better story out of it. Horror movies in general are pretty predictable, and unless you have a really unique concept or a unique vision, it's just gonna be another horror film to me.",2022-11-17
"My adrenaline was through the roof throughout the whole movie. I loved how the movie played with my expectations of what would happen in the movie. It might start like a romantic comedy for some viewers, but the fact that I knew it's a horror movie kept me intrigued and suspicious. The film has depth and layers and it does a great job at explaining the plot, leaving you satisfied, knowing that you don't have to leave the theater with silly cliffhangers. The way the movie develops reminded me of ""Don't Breath"" as well as ""Get Out"". I think one of the elements that makes the film is scary is how relatable it is, renting a place, sleeping in it and trusting there's nothing or anyone lurking in the dark. I hadn't enjoyed a horror movie so much in a long time.",2022-09-09
"Wonderfully spooky flick with a scary monster wielding one of my true nightmares - the baby bottle. A woman finds her Airbnb double-booked. It's nighttime, raining, and the person already ensconced is a he, a strange he, which makes her hesitant to enter when he offers to share - but she does. In the night she awakens to find her bedroom door open after a female-ish sound. This movie is drenched in brooding mood, from the nostalgic dread soundtrack to the smoky gloom of the rental house. Each level of the house is a quantum leap scarier. Our girl is presented with a frightening monster and figures out how to live, no matter how inhuman the situation.",2022-11-19
"I watched ""Men"" not long ago, and was absolutely dumbfounded at how a movie that seems to start as a flawless and unique horror movie can spiral into idiotic stunts and body horror with no discernable direction or point by the end. I though... and hoped... that it was the only such movie I would have to witness. Then I watched Barbarian.First, there is no ""barbarian."" The name makes no sense. Second, the silliness does not accent the horror, like in a well-crafted genre mash-up, but instead smothers a creept first 2 acts with a goofy and outright stupid 3rd and 4th. Lastly, and most egregiously, it descends into so many clichés and tropes I can't even list them all. The movie could have and should have either stopped suddenly after the creature reveal, or better yet, have never been released.",2023-07-22
"I went into watching this movie without knowing anything about it in advance, so I didn't have any particular expectations for it. Was pleasantly surprised to see Bill Skarsgard. The slowburn at the beginning was very nice, gaining up on the horror aspect and at the same time not being too obvious about what exactly is about to happen. Thought it would keep the suspense going till the end, but it all got ruined when they started introducing multiple storylines in a very chaotic manner. Kinda felt like the producer lost the idea what he was filming mid-movie and it somehow turned into a horror parody while quickly catching up with all the cliches that were missing before. Very dissapointed with the wasted potential that was there in the beginning.",2022-10-30
"I enjoyed it! The setting complimented the plot and set the mood of the movie. There were moments where the theatre audience laughed, screamed, and gasped. Overall a good plot with decent acting and good cinematography. The movie leads you one direction then twists and turns halfway through and at the end. I recommend most 20th Century movies as they present a unique perspective in their respective genre. The undertones of this movie revealed the intrinsic problems with certain areas of the United States and the challenges women and minorities face. I would give it a try if you have some spare time.",2022-09-18
"Like so many others have already pointed out, this is a movie with a massive amount of potential that fails tremendously in the last act. Lets start with the good.Barbarian has fantastic acting, great shots, great music, great atmosphere, and a unique take on a relatively simple idea. The suspense and pacing of the first half are masterful. Everything is coated in dread and mystery and you're left on the edge of your seat. All of this stays true throughout the duration of the film. It's the story that takes a hit in the 2nd half.When the first ""switch"" happens, the movie tonally changes. It becomes more tounge and cheek with a lot of humor. Some of it really works and is a nice break. Some is borderline slapstick and eye-rolling cringe. As it goes on, the writer doesn't know when to stop. And this is an issue that bleeds into nearly all parts of the story. It doesnt know when to stop the humor, it doesnt know when to stop giving us information about the monster, and it doesnt know when to end.The absolute worst part is the ending that it does decide to go with. By the time the movie is over, the monster is comical and the characters arcs are in ashes. One of the worst endings I've seen in a horror movie and you'll be left with such a bad taste in your mouth, you'll be reevaluating the whole movie. This is the reason for a lot of the 1-star ratings. What it leaves you with is such a different level of quality than what you started with, its hard to remember the gem that it started out as.All in all, disappointing, original, annoying, riveting, all wrapped up into one cult horror movie. With a painfully bad ending. 7/10.",2022-09-21
"THIS is how you do horror. The directing and story telling were done very well, especially in the first half. What suspense and build up, I loved every sequence that took place specifically with the first main two characters. The rich homeowner guy wasn't the best character and toward the end the movie got a bit ridiculous with the gun not being used when it should have been/dropped. The two cops not helping the main woman also annoyed me, they could've been made/convinced to do more. I did like that it took place in Detroit, my home town! When they described the neighborhood/area I was like ""yup, that's Detroit"". Overall I am very impressed and was engaged/on the edge of my seat literally the entire time!!",2023-08-30
"I just watched this in the theater, not knowing anything about it. The first act is truly suspenseful, keeps your attention the entire time, not knowing at all what is going to happen next, keeps you guessing is this a killer story? Supernatural?And the premise of an airbnb being booked by two people on the same date is a fresh idea. Normally a horror film featuring a house as the main location, is almost always a family moving in or whatever, so this brings something new, which I really enjoyed. The tension is fantastic. The whole first scene in the basement was just wonderfully made, honestly hadn't felt such tension in a movie in I don't know how long.Then, the second and third act I thought were not as good as the first one, it becomes a much more conventional story with lots of horror movie tropes and a surprisingly not so unusual theme for a horror movie, but enjoyable nonetheless.The Music and camera work were disctintively good.Overall it was definitely worth watching it in the theater, and would watch it again in the future for sure.",2022-09-11
"How can someone book an Airbnb without doing a little check up on the surrounding neighbourhood???For me, in order to get hooked watching a film the first 15 minutes are imperative to get my attention otherwise I end up writing a review like this one.Ok so you are so busy that you book an airbnb and do no research about the area it is located in. Fine. When you get there... you find it is been double booked. You should leave but you dont. Fine.The next day your new employer is baffled as to why the hell are you staying in that neighbourhood. Leave at once. But the character decides no lets stay. Even after seeing the area in daylight and noticing it is the only house thats not destroyed.I understand it is a film. But if you are that stupid in the film then only stupid people should watch it and give it a 7,8 or whatever star rating.This film is for idiots!",2022-11-17
"What a shame. The first half had so much promise. The build is steady with an intriguing scenario. The interaction between the original two characters is engaging. Unfortunately, the second part of the film is terrible.Going in, I had no idea regarding the film's content except that it was an acclaimed horror film. So I essentially went in blind.The film starts on a dark, rainy night with a woman called Tess arriving at a house. She has booked to stay in house while in town for a job interview. After discovering the front door key is missing from the key-press, Tess notices a light come on in the house. After knocking, a man called Keith opens the door. It turns out there has been a double-booking. The suspicious Keith invites Tess in, who cautiously accepts. This was all put together really well.Many seeds are planted in order for the viewer to become invested: How did the double booking occur? Who exactly is Keith? What is the significance of the house? I was really enjoying a film that seemed tight and full of mystery. There is obviously more to this than meets the eye.After entering the basement, Tess makes a sinister discovery: a hidden door leading down a dark corridor to a small cell-like room. Inside she finds a bed with a filthy mattress and a camera tripod set up.Naturally terrified by this, she encourages Keith to check out the basement. Keith obliges but disappears after entering the secret passage. Tess calls out to Keith with no response. Unnerved, Tess enters the corridor in pursuit of Keith.Tess encounters Keith crawling on the floor. He appears in a frightened state. Moments later a huge, naked Blair Witch woman appears, smashing Keith's head to pieces against a wall. The scene ends with the creature screaming in Tess' face.Then we move on to the second half of the film. Ok here's the deal:There is a 7ft mutated inbred monster woman in the basement who holds people captive a treats them like literal babies. Bet you didn't see that coming.A flashback shows a freak who kidnapped women, imprisoned them and got them pregnant. A tale as old as time.The monster is then shown making the captive Tess drink from a baby bottle and then forcefully breastfeeding a man.I could go on, but it's all totally absurd. All manner of questions remained unanswered.This reminded me of Creep (2004, the one with in the London Underground). A great build with plenty of intrigue...but totally ruined when the antagonist is revealed. Bad to a laughable degree.This film gets a 5 because the first half wad very well done but the second half was utterly stupid.",2023-02-05
"I was duped by the stellar reviews. What a waste of my time. Barbarian is one of the WORST movies ever if not the WORST. Didn't even jump once. Terrible terrible movie. Do yourself a favor and don't watch. Poor acting, no plot. The female lead was so stupid it was almost painful to watch. As for the plot, I mean what plot? I will never understand critics I guess they're paid off to make us like terrible movies that would not make a penny otherwise. Please give me back my hour and a half of my life! Don't waste your time. Ugh I don't know what else to write but the app won't let me publish unless I write a novel.",2022-12-18
"Who thought this was good? I haven't seen a movie this bad in a long while. All the characters are the dumbest people alive (or dead). None of it makes any sense. Every plot point was throw-away. The only surprise in the whole movie occurred in the first act. Once you realize these characters are idiots who will definitely choose the worst options, you get everything that will happen. I will never get those two hours back.I won't include spoilers because any sane person wouldn't believe that they would be plot points put to film. Nothing has any explanation that makes sense. Nobody acts like a real person. Nobody is likable, for that matter. You will hate everyone and everything and wish that you hadn't wasted your time.So please, don't.",2022-11-06
"You just know that a movie is going to be a winner when the likes of Justin Long is in it. (sarcasm.) Too many ""horror"" films now are so stupid, predictable, and badly written that it's hard to finish watching them, and one can't wait for the ""monster"" to get the vapid, foul-mouthed, annoying characters that are in them. What's almost sad is that younger generations are so used to being fed a steady diet of of drecky movies like this that they don't know what a truly good horror movie is. The bar has been set very low. Barbarian is yet another one made by some fat, untalented frat boy who's deluded himself into thinking he has a filmmaking career ahead of him. I couldn't finish watching this, but I really hope that the ""monster with saggy boobs"" (now those were scary!) killed everyone in it, especially Justin Long's character.",2023-06-04
"It was a solid first act. It, at least, was interesting and intriguing, well acted, as you try to work out what is going on. How could Acts Two and Three be so awful. How did this get released? I'm still pissed at how I was taken in by daft reviewers out there framing the film as the best thing since sliced bread in the horror world. It isn't. Yeah, there is room in the horror genre for everything, even this dog, I guess. But that doesn't excuse the write-ups and reviews calling it inventive, scary, dark, brilliant (??) because it isn't. Watch The People Under the Stairs, Watch Hemlock Grove to see a truly perverse, frightening TV series with Bill Skarsgård. But don't piss down my back (The Outlaw Josey Wales) and tell ME it's raining. Three stars for Act One.",2022-11-12
"This movie plays with your expectations with incredible success throughout its first 2/3 before settling into a more conventional finale, though still completely bonkers. Well directed, there are lots of fateful moments shown, not told through the actor's performance and they framing of the scene. Bill Skarsgard delivers a creepy and twisty performance, while our final girl Georgina Campbell believably conveys both fear and bravery in equal measure. Thematically this film explores questions of toxic masculinity, gender dynamics, and urban blight with varying degrees of success. While not perfect, if you enjoy a good fright this film will tickle all the right receptors and speaking only for myself I had a fabulous time. Bravo!",2022-09-08
"So...uh...didn't know the guy from Whitest Kids U Know could actually do a decent film. The less said about this film the better, and honestly one time is enough for me for this film. Even though I enjoyed it, it plays to literally every single fear I have, so it was not an enjoyable watching experience per se. Seriously the first two thirds of this movie had me going ""No thank you!"" and wanting to crawl away in shame. I do think it loses some power as it nears its finish because it gets admittedly a little too over the top. I also didn't really like what they did with Justin Long's character. He killed his performance obviously but I do think it just added an unnecessary element to the story. Other than that this is very good, very well made, go watch it. Even if you don't like it I reckon the movie will still be very memorable. Huge props to Anna Drubich who turned in an excellent score. And also the set designers, once you see this you'll know what I mean.",2022-10-06
"This movie had a great start. The first 45 minutes were great. Great characters, great acting, the story was lining up to be really chilling, but at about the 45 minute mark, it went down the tubes. Once you get to the the main characters down in the tunnel and then it switches to Justin Long in the red car on the sunny highway, just turn it off. You've seen all the movie has to offer and just write your own ending because it turns into D-grade junk after that. Which is too bad, because it started out really, really good. I don't understand how this went so wrong because all the elements were there, but the ""monster"" was ridiculous and it just could've been such a nail biter. Oh, well.",2022-11-28
"Bad reviews are how you know what an amazing film this actually is...If you're reading the bad reviews on this movie, take them as a hint as to how good it actually is. I put Barbarian up with other movies that were absolutely excellent but so many watchers didn't understand. If you're a true cinefile then you don't need everything fed you at the end like a flashback to understand what actually happened in the movie. Unfortunately if you're an amateur film buff, you do need that extra help to get it.You won't get that in this movie. It is cerebral, has lots of hidden meaning and Easter eggs and honestly has an ending that will leave you somewhat wanting more and wanting to watch the movie again. There is so much to unpack with this movie.Understand that majority of the bad reviews are from people who just don't understand why this movie is so good. I rank it up there with movies like 2001 A Space Odyssey, Chariots of Fire, the original Dune, and to a certain extent The Sixth Sense. The same people who wrote bad reviews on those movies are the same ones writing bad reviews on this one. Can't blame them though, they just don't understand the movie.If you are a true cinefile and you enjoy movies that make you think not just force feed you all the answers at the end, you will likely love this movie. It's clearly in the horror genre but I would equally give it Thriller and mystery as well.",2022-10-25

"Original script and briilliant character development in the first 20 minutes, then with rapid deterioration, it nose dives to a rapid decline of what could have been a great story. I expected a good plot. It seem to contain all the initial elements of a good story with an excellent cast.The setting and the cast were a draw to this film, yet having built up so much momentum to a great story I still cannot believe such a great initial premise would end up in complete ribbons of a dreadful conclusion. Since I heard of this plot, I was intrigued and looking forward to watching the story, what a disappointment.",2022-10-26
"I was putting off reviewing this, because I needed some time to think a little before writing my review.This is certainly for horror lovers, who likes unexpected twists, in their stories. This film keeps you questioning things all throughout its run time, but the reveal is going to divide opinions, while some would see this as shockingly disturbing and original, others might view it as ridiculous and stupid.I thought it was well written with clear themes regarding feminism and the mystery of the house keeps growing even after the big reveal. I also liked the unexpected choice made by a character near the end, that choice felt comedic but it wasn't out of place.I liked many of its ideas, but this movie is all about shocking the viewer with its reveal. I couldn't vouch for anyone so I don't think I will watch it a second time.",2022-09-25
"Bone-chilling first act. Scary stuff. Probably the best opening scene in a horror film I've ever watched. It used to be ""When I Stranger Calls"" but not anymore. Obviously, it's hard to live up to that but the film choses to derail itself and have fun with it, which I think is a good choice. The plot feels completely free. Zach Cregger has fun managing expectations and incidentally includes simple but effective moments of dark humour and social critique.So many script games affect the impact of the plot, but rather than being fatally flawed by this mistake, the film sticks to the plan... and still holds surprises. The result is as chaotic as it is entertaining. Georgina Campbell plays a good lead and no one plays s complete idiot quite like Justin Long.There is something about the coldness of the evil portrayed here that is deeply unsettling, and I mean that far beyond the obvious. For how careless this thing seems, it really knows how to turn dark quickly, inviting the audience to imagine the unimaginable.",2023-05-04
"OK, so I started watching barbarian and because of a recommendation from a friend. I'm so skeptical of today's horror movies, because they seem to lack creativity and seem to rush, showing you whatever the creature, demon, bad guy is so quickly in the film that it ruins, the suspense, scariness And creepiness. Today's horror films don't seem to let your mind do most of the work like the great horror movies of the past. However, that was not the case with this movie I'm not going to say anything to spoil it, just know that it is very well done . I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie. I watched it a few times, picked up different stuff, appreciated different stuff. It is very well done and one of the better horror movies I've seen in the last 20 years.",2022-10-26
"I ticked the spoiler box but the movie makers spoilt this.At the start this had my brain working, thinking where is this going, is it going to be a conspiracy trick/trap with a kidnapper and a sidekick SAW style? Is it going to get into graphic torture territory HOSTEL style. When the girl discovered the hidden room with a bloody bed, bucket & video camera i turned off because i really thought this isn't going to be a light watch, i would need to concentrate as i was doing something else while it was on, this is going to get nasty. When i put it back on the next day i thought this underground hidden room was connected to the other derelict trashed houses & some kind of terrible kidnapping plot was going on, and all manner of hideous crimes would be unearthed, something like BUFFALO BILLS basement or horror with a whole neighbourhood of participants involved.No, it just got unbelievably stupid. A one man dug basement apartment complete with his own daughter who is supposed to be an inbred incest human but has superhuman strength, can smash through walls, crush heads, tear off limbs. Its like a serious movie suddenly had Peter Griffin take over as script writer.A stupid film that could have been good if it didn't go the bizarre monster route.",2022-12-11
"I dont know what all the 1 star reviewers were expecting but this wasnt a bad horror movie at all. It has suspense, some jump scares, some laughs, some really gross parts- and it's certainly original. The movie is broken up into different segments, so much so that i asked allowed if we had changed the movie accidentally at one point. It all ends up making some sort of sense in the end though. Good cast as well, i was surprised to see Justin Long in the movie as well as Skarsgaard.I think its worth a watch if you like the horror genre or if you like weird and original movies. I had to leave a review since so many were dumping on this movie. Its worth a watch for sure.",2022-11-10
"I'm not sure where people are giving this movie as anything more than rotten. It was terrible writing, D-movie acting and the plot made little to no sense jumping back and forth. If people's idea of horror is this movie, then the future of horror movies is toast! Not to mention, the editing on the movie was so choppy. I'm glad I was not the one who paid $$$ - just lost time. It seemed like it was a very low budget movie shot with an i-phone and flashlight. Bottom line these days is that production companies need to find better screenwriters. Just because someone has an idea for a film doesn't mean they can actually write it. This movie had a lot of 'holes' in the storyline that were just left hanging. Don't waste your money or time. Beyond boring.",2022-09-30
"Barbarian (2022) :
Brief Review -A barbarous horror flick with some amazing obscene scares and unnecessary old cliches. The whole reason why I wanted to see this film was that many people called it one of the best horror films of the year. They were right, somewhat.. not fully. My vote will still go to ""Nope"" for the horror crown of this year for its technical brilliance and atmospheric binding of unseen horrors. Here, Barbarian is very much grounded and has many cliches from old school. To start with a story, it's about a girl who rents a house that is shared by a stranger. They both spend a night there, and the next day she finds out some horrible facts about the place. There is a basement where a creature-woman has been living for more than 40 years and hunts down the people. There is a mother angle to it, on which I won't elaborate to avoid spoilers. The screenplay is damn too banal for a proper horror flick. It wastes time giving an introduction of the characters when it has nothing to do with the story or the ghost or creature. There is no clarity about the creature and its past, such as what happened, how, or why. The second half has a new man coming to the House who has some sexual abuse cases against him. I don't see how those 15 minutes of runtime from his life fit in the screenplay. The ghost doesn't know it, and neither does the girl. Then why the heck would you waste those 15 minutes in a ""Horror thriller""? The climax has all outdated theories, from 'you are safe here,' 'coming back to save the man,' to 'crushing the creature with the car' (as if one can really kill a ghost by crushing it, Lol). It is a slow film for sure and should have been cut by 15-20 minutes. Rest, the performance, scares, screams, and a few directional segments make for a one-time watch for the true horror fans. Zach Cregger used $4.5 million of his budget to create something that's worth 10 times more. It just missed a high mark by its weak story and screenplay; otherwise, a very good Black Friday outing.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest.",2022-12-31
"Classic horror-genre tropes with modern twists made ""Barbarian"" a great Halloween-weekend watch. It contained elements borrowed not only from yesteryear horror movies but also horror games. You'll never look at an Airbnb rental the same way again after watching this scream-worthy story.Zach Cregger did an outstanding job writing and directing this insane flick. Joe Murphy's editing ensured a steady and frightening pace. Zach Kuperstein's cinematography was nerve-racking good. Anna Drubich's musical scoring was fright-fest fantastic. Such superb sound effects too. Kiril Naumov's costume design was great. The hair-makeup, stunts, art direction, set direction, VFX, practical effects, and production design teams all did stellar work.Tess, played by Georgina Campbell, was exemplary. She didn't just give a 'scream queen' performance but also that of a determined realist experiencing her share of ill luck. Keith, played by Bill Skarsgård, was outstanding. His every dialogue was flawlessly delivered.Frank, played by Richard Brake, was great. He was simultaneously suave and scary. The physical performance of the 'mother creature' was superbly enacted by Matthew Patrick Davis. Andre, played by Jaymes Butler, was notable. And all those who contributed only voiceovers did great work.AJ, played by Justin Long, was brilliant. It was nice to see him be part of another horror jewel after ""Jeepers Creepers"" (2001) - I caught that eye reference in the movie, btw. Long's natural performance was the Goldilocks factor that made this movie work. Such an under-rated actor with a compelling technique.Whoever did the casting for this movie deserves a raise. Everyone did noteworthy work in ""Barbarian"" now streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.A good portion of this script felt like it was inspired by the best psychological-horror tropes. I loved the way they layered each scene and ensured an unfaltering thread of suspense from start to finish. The sheer anticipation of danger enriched the story and kept me on the edge of my seat.An accidental case of double-booking saw two people sharing the same rental space to get their money's worth. They discovered an underground basement that was fifty shades of shady. Also, I couldn't predict any of the shocking twists and timely character entries. All of this made the movie feel 'in the moment'.The way circumstances unravelled in ""Barbarian"" made it one of the most outstanding horror movies to watch during Halloween of 2022, and the best I've seen all year. This movie has what it takes to spawn its own hit franchise. I dare you to watch it alone at night and not feel at least one tingle shoot up your spine.",2022-10-31
"I actually really liked this. It would seem to the untrained eye like there were plenty of plot-holes like other reviewers have mentioned, however I felt that these were done deliberately to throw us off.I am an avid lover of horror. I haven't seen a decent horror movie this year, having seen both 'The Black Phone' and 'Smile' and feeling let down by both.This movie was original and refreshing and very unpredictable. I hate to admit I'm one of those annoying people during movies that announces what is going to happen next when it's predictable. However, I was pleasantly surprised (and embarrassed) to have been wrong most times on this one.I was convinced several times that something was going to happen, and it didn't... and I think that's all part of the intelligence of this movie.I really enjoyed it, albeit the ending was abrupt.I would definitely avoid all spoilers for this like I did and go in blind to be pleasantly surprised.It's creepy, gory, full of suspense and has the shock factor. Overall, I give it an 8/10.",2022-10-30
"I read people's reviews regretting to have spent money in the theather for this, I regret for watching it home and just wasting 2 hours of my time.First act was brilliant. Then another movie starts. I don't get why did it switch? Why? Who wrote this?I am tired of seeing the police never trusting the victim, I am tired of seeing characters make stupid choices, tired of plot holes, of creating bizzare and non-sense villains/monsters...
What is this? I feel like my inteligence has been insulted the worst possible way.Spare your time and money, do not see this. I repeat. Do not see this. Don't.",2022-10-30
"Set in Detroit, Michigan, Tess Marshall (Georgina Campbell) is a woman spending the night at an Airbnb while in town for a job interview, only to find another person, Keith Toshko (Bill Skarsgard) has doubled booked it through Homeaway. Both try and fail to contact the owners of the house, and with a medical convention in town Tess is unable to secure a hotel room for the night. Keith offers to let Tess stay the night in the bedroom while he sleeps on the couch which she eventually accepts, but is there more going on in this house?Barbarian comes to us from writer/director Zach Cregger who was inspired by a section in the non-fiction book, The Gift of Fear, to create a premise featuring as many red flags as possible from that book. The initial pitch was rejected by potential partners such as A24 and Neon but did eventually find traction at Roy Lee's Vertigo Entertainment and thanks to various grandfathered deals was given distribution by 20th Century Fox. While the film's trailer gives the impression of this being the kind being fairly standard, the execution is anything but and leaves you surprised in the best way possible.I really can't talk about too many details in this movie because much to my surprise, in an era where market research dictates showing all the ""money moments"" you can in a trailer, Barbarian really only features footage from the first 20 to 30 minutes with many of the story's twists and reversals kept secret and I really have to hand it to this movie on that front. Technically speaking it is a really well-done horror film with good use of lighting, some absolutely great cinematography, and long unbroken shots that help build mood and atmosphere. The only criticism I can think of is maybe in some behaviors in the latter half of the film, but the movie also has a sly sense of humor so it earns enough leeway on that point that it scores in both creepy and darkly humorous.Barbarian is a real treat for horror fans and I can't recommend it enough. While there are leaps in narrative logic that will be a case of ""buy it or you don't"", the stuff that works does so really well.",2022-10-29
"I had to write the title in pidgin cause that's how pained I am? Why would you rate this kind of movie 7? I thought I was going to be in for a fun ride when I saw Bill Skarsgard (forgive my misspelling) but it was absolute nonsense. Boring, not thrilling, uninteresting story line. I didn't understand the point of the movie, everything was just going up and down, left and right. I gave it a three because it had potential from the beginning, but when it got to the ""horror"" part, it's like the writer or director just lost interest and did free for all, anything goes. With all the hype I expected it to be better, sorely disappointed. Don't recommend.",2023-05-29
"I didn't mind the 1st half. This said, it never went beyond mediocrity in my pov. The idea of two persons renting the same place is very generation now, so it might attract exactly these audience... but I never had the feeling watching anything groundbreaking really. It's at times eerie but flawed by cliches and questionable decisions ... the abrupt shift and new story aspect - sort of wrong turn vibe - didn't convince me at all.The truly tragic aspect of the lady getting kidnapped and held hostage for decades is actually more heartbreaking and gruesome than the explicit portray of cruelty and terror.",2023-02-25
"Wow...getting six hundred characters out of this one isn't going to be easy... it DOES start off well...it LOOKS good...the acting is good...but there just isn't enough going on in any direction to have made it worth my time. It was scary in parts but it was trite...i thought the makeup was good. SO good that i couldn't tell it was a man playing a woman's part. That's probably the best part of the whole movie...the ultimate trick of it. And let's face it, if that's the best 'trick' of the movie how good could it be..? It seems like it was a one trick pony that needed a lot of filler, which was done well, to get to the scary part. And yaaaaaaay. I'm past the minimum character limit.Don't waste your time. For once the negative reviews were right. I got fooled by the high rating. Hopefully, my low rating will help that. In fact...i'm going to change it from 3 stars to 2 stars.",2022-11-13
"It makes no sense to write about all the aspects of this movie that are done right--There's many. So I'll write about what was not done right.The dialogue in the beginning of the movie is a little weak. It gives off the impression that what's about to come is predictable but any sense of predictability gets turned on its head as we move forward and before the end.When the protagonist discovers that there's a red flag, you'd expect her just to walk away. But she does not. And then she discovers another red flag, and another. She still does not simply walk away. Later we may learn that she is not simply dumb, she's a little brave too.It becomes, at some point, a case of 'curiosity killed the cat.' But some decisions make sense more than others and more so for other characters than others. But, ultimately, don't be fooled, many decisions seen would not have been made unless the character making the decision was a little crazy.There's build up but then the story stops and we see it from the perspective of another character. This takes something away, but it's not too bad because the way the stories connect is ultimately shown.The ending of any movie will make or break it. If the good guys win or if the bad guys win how do they do it? Every semi-ambitious movie tries to portray a certain level of creativity. And I do think that it comes down to creatively, more than other factors. Here, it's not nothing, but I can't help but want more.",2022-09-17
"Barbarian (2022) is a movie that is sure to disappoint. The story is disjointed and confusing, the acting is wooden. The movie fails to capitalize on any of its potential and feels like a waste of time. It is unlikely to be remembered for any length of time and it is unlikely that anyone would recommend it to a friend.I set through it waiting for some incredible turn over that would explain high rating of this movie. But it never happened.The movie promised to be average first 15 minutes, than it turned to complete disaster.It leaves more questions than answers and zero satisfaction.Do not watch it.",2023-01-09
"Barbarian: Three narrative strands eventually coalesce to create an enthralling tale of terror. The plot line involving a Tv star is heavy on black humoir as he is a terrible cad; the double-booked Airbnb swiftly descends into a tale of terror and the 1980 sequence ties it all together. We have a tale of basements within basements, a tunnel complex containing cages. But who lives there? You get quite a few of the standard horror tropes but they're deftly handled here. Underground no one can here you scream. Characters make unwise decisions but yiu can sort of understand that ihey act through empathy rather than being stupid. Some grim scenes with heads bashed in and limbs ripped off. The dead, abandoned suburbs of Chicago are vividly displayed, police showing indifference to someone they take to be street person. An engaging horror thriller which doesn't sacrifice plot consistency for a few more shocks. Written and Directed by Zach Cregger. 8/10.",2022-11-02
"Horror movie of 2022. It is one of the rare movies that suits the name of horror lately. I really liked the movie. I'm so glad I didn't read anything about the movie that I can't describe it. I hope the viewers watch and enjoy without reading comments or topics. The music in the movie was pretty good. I love the time transitions. It felt like watching a movie within a movie. There is only one thing left on my mind. Who is renting the house?There is no sex in the movie, but there is nudity. But not conspicuous nudity.I definitely recommend the movie. I'm sure this movie would be very enjoyable to watch in the cinema.",2022-11-06
"Barbarian is best seen knowing as little as possible, resulting in an extremely unpredictable horror film that's constantly swapping genres and styles whilst still managing to keep the exploration of its core themes consistent and deliver plenty of terrifying moments.Georgina Campbell gives a terrific lead performance with her kindness and determination and has solid chemistry with Bill Skarsgård, who brings just the right amount of untrustworthiness to his seemingly nice guy.Justin Long is ridiculously good at playing a character whose really easy to hate, his humour always lands (most importantly, at his expense) and he delivers one of the more horrifying moment of the film perfectly.Zach Cregger's direction is excellent, despite constantly adding different styles an overall style/voice is still present. There are a few moments that feel unintentionally funny but they're counterbalanced by how good the film is at building suspense and some truly uncomfortable scares.",2022-11-19
"Is why movies today are c@@p!!! It started out ok. Not an original genre but then I thought something had happened and I hit a button and a different movie was playing. This is not brilliant or exciting. There is no story here. SPOILERS
So it started out kind of creepy and decent then it goes downhill once the tunnel is discovered in the basement! It's like it get all PC and then there's the original girl and this stupid old woman/ thing is thrown in! What is she? What does she want?? Sadly because things are written so poorly today we'll never now. They show some brief stuff about 30 years before of the man that use to live there .. But .. We never really find out anything! Just some creepy old ( devils reject) lady that says "" Momma over and over! Mindless drivel and a waste of your precious time!

The other two main guys do a pretty good job overall.The story is where things really go wrong. It's just not that interesting. In fact, it's kind of boring. Once again it would be fine for a sit at home type of movie that's free but for a movie to pay for ? No thank you.4/10 movies like this are why I do not go to the theater anymore. I do not trust the grades on movies anymore.",2022-10-26
"Writer/director Zach Cregger proves himself to be a bonafide jack-in-the-box horror filmmaker with ""Barbarian,"" beginning with a nightmare that could happen to any of us-a double-booked Airbnb. Documentary researcher Tess (an excellent Georgina Campbell) arrives at night in the pouring rain to a little house in a forgotten part of Detroit, and a sleepy guy named Keith is already staying there. He eventually convinces her to stay until they can get this sorted: she can see his proof of reservation, he'll take the couch, he can watch her open the bottle of wine someone left before he pours. Later on, Justin Long shows up at the house. His Hollywood dude AJ is introduced zipping down some coastal road in a convertible, only to find out in a phone call that he's being accused of doing something horrible to an actress. As someone who very likely did said thing, AJ is more concerned with his career and in putting this behind him. Long is adept at playing the sincerely terrible nature of the guy, down to a good laugh-out-loud joke in how he gets involved with this mess at the Airbnb (""Barbarian"" could be funnier, and its lack of more comic relief is a copout). A movie like this flourishes on the choices that characters make, and Long's slick creep is its most sound construction. There's nothing strikingly new to ""Barbarian,"" and its use of a murdered Detroit as a character doesn't do enough to shake off ""Don't Breathe"" comparisons, but the artistic impulses of Cregger's project make it a bold curiosity. The film has a compelling instinct of when to abruptly cut and fling us from one freaky moment to a different time zone or decade, allowing the viewer to breathe while then paying close attention to how the latest life story will fit in. And there's an ambition in how these new elements are included, creating vignettes of sorts made of cinematographer Zach Kuperstein's different aspect ratios and extensive shots, filling in the movie's thick atmosphere. The title ""Barbarian"" rings throughout, like the wailing choir and screeching strings from Anna Drubich's score; its significance creates a metaphorical house of mirrors, and disturbingly so.",2022-10-26
"I rented this desperate for something to watch over Halloween weekend - not about to spend over $17.00 to buy. I watched the preview over and over and, even though I knew better, I rented it. Like I said - desperate. The trailer looked awesome! It was just the kind of thing with super potential. I really liked the 2 main characters at the beginning but then....what the heck are these writers on in Hollywood? If they need any ideas, I would be happy to help out!! A dumb-de-dumb girl who does not take her stuff and leave the very next morning after seeing the neighborhood?? Ok, so she had a crush on Keith and they made some kind of connection but even so, I would have left him a note saying like ""Get the hell out of here unless you want to die. Meet me at so and so for a cup of coffee and I will tell you why but GET OUT! I am calling the police on this rental company."" ANYWAY, this is a sequel to ""Home"" from X-Files Season 4. That is all I gotta say. Peace - I'm OUT!",2022-10-31
"For the majority of Barbarian, I found myself very entertained. Sure you have characters making stupid decisions. But the direction, cinematography and performances were all great. Especially from Georgina Campbell and Justin Long. The story unfolds in a way I didn't except. Which I appreciated. However, where this film stumbles is in its climax. The last 10 minutes are absolutely ridiculous. As I stated earlier, this film was already silly. But it was somewhat tolerable. The ending completely lost me and was totally unsatisfactory. I'd say it's better than The Black Phone because I was rather entertained with this for most of it's duration, whereas The Black Phone was mostly just cheesy and didn't make any sense.",2022-09-11
"There's so many intriguing questions that this film leaves unanswered. If they actually followed through with half the things they alluded to, then sheesh this might've been best horror movie of the year. Yet it kept me tense asf and entertained the whole time, despite naive character decisions that had me shaking my head. And the humorous tonal shift with Jason Long was brilliant to keep this film feeling well paced. The jump scares & dark humor made it extremely entertaining, although not too scary, but I was tight asf. The camera movements also attribute to the creepiness and the decent scares.This felt a lot like another timeline version of Don't Breathe (2016)",2022-09-09

"Combined with a good soundtrack and some initial thrills, this movie had promise but floundered the further along it went. Georgina Campbell plays a convincing role, other than some highly questionable choices - which is all too common for a horror flick. Nevertheless, hers is the standout performance. Bill Skarsgard makes decent use of his limited screen time. Justin Long, however, misses the mark and shows us what ""over acting"" looks like. There is intriguing mystery and suspense in the first half of the movie, but then it devolves into incredulity and ultimately a disappointing finish. One of those times where you say ""it could have been so much more.""",2022-11-06
"Yes I know you suspend belief for horror movies of course but this had so many implausible aspects in the ""real life"" part it was distracting.1) Two people on their own rent the entire house for just themselves? Weird, why wouldn't they just get an apartment? Especially for a quick job interview, not vacation.2) There's a main female character with a rented car and someone else in her rental. Yes it's raining, fine, but if she has a car, no way in hell would she get in the house with a strange man in it, she'd go in her car.3) Same thing when the guy on the street is running after her yelling. She gets out of her car to fumble with the lock and get in the house? Hell no, she'd get back in the car and drive away. At this point I was like, ""this was written by a man who has no idea how it feels to be afraid of strangers. "" Were there no women working on this film, or did no one listen to them? I'll forgive any number of dumb horror movie tropes because that's the genre, of course, but that was just implausible and annoying.The rest was medium-level popcorn horror. Delivers what it promises.",2023-03-08
"I am really quite surprised at how many good reviews this movie has. This was not a good horror film. They really should have made the whole story about the woman and man at the beginning of the film. That was tense and suspenseful. Then they had to put in the complete left turn and the movie never recovered. Sure, I get the creepy idea of the old guy having kids with the women he kidnapped. And after a while, there would be mutations because of inbreeding. But how many generations would it take to make that lady mutant? (More than two). And why did she wind up having super powers? I gave it two stars because, sure, it had a few jump scares and the first act was solid, but after that- nothing. Terrible movie. Don't waste your time or money.",2022-10-15
"Like ""The Cabin in the Woods"" and ""Triangle"", this is the kind of film which is hard to discuss without spoiling, which is a type of horror I'm normally into, but I'm sorry to say that this film disappointed me quite a bit. I will grant that its first half hour was very well-done though. The airbnb premise initially seemed like a questionable choice for a setup, but I think the film utilized the awkward situation in the first half hour really well since Tess's and Keith's reactions to their situations were well-done. The sense of unease and distrust amongst them carried the first act for me. Once the ball started rolling though, the film failed to be scary and mostly devolved into some ridiculous behavior by certain characters and plenty of dull and uninspiring grotesque gags. While I'm normally not into grotesque horror, it can work in the right context (the final 10 minutes of ""Rec"" are a good example of this), but the grotesque horror in this film turned me off the more off the rails it went. I didn't hate the film as the first act contained enough potential to keep me on board with it and, in spite of what I said about the rest of the film, a certain flashback scene in the middle was particularly well-done, but overall, it just seemed like a waste of a good premise.",2023-03-01
The first 30 minutes was quite creepy. The two actors - Bill Skarsgard and Georgina Campbell made it feel like it was going to be a proper horror and had really good chemistry. It kept you guessing. And then it turns into a comedy with the wrongful addition of Justin Long. Who is a terrible actor. There are no scares and when there could have been there wasn't. All very disjointed too. Not really an explanation of the events of the film. Just terrible. And a format that has been done a million times before. Don't watch it whether you're a horror buff or not. And a predictable ending as well. Shame really.,2022-11-03
"Two young people accidentally rent the same B&B. Tess (Georgina Campbell) and Keith (Bill Skarsgard) decide to stay for the night and sort it out later. A skeezy actor AJ (Justin Long) also figures in the mix.Writer-Director Zach Creeger amps up the dread right from the start with even the most ordinary happenings being treated as sinister. A daytime meeting at a cafe is shot and scored like an axe murder is about to happen. When the first act finally reaches its climax its not the shocker it should be because the audience has been strung along too much. It's indicative of Creeger's lack of a sense of pace and moderation ( (same with much of Anna Drubich's soundtrack). Instead of lulling the viewer, it's more like: Finally! SOMEthing happened to justify all the caterwauling.Many horror films rely on the 'Idiot plot' where only a fool would remain in the situation that is putting them in peril. Of course, without said idiots, many of the movies would be over by half-time. Creeger certainly has them here. On the positive side of the ledger, Campbell and Skarsgard do play off well with one another and most of the cast is similarly decent including that of a neighborhood drifter named Andre (Jaymes Butler). There are also a couple of amusing real estate barbs. Creeger does a couple of interesting structural moves, but they only temporarily divert from the deficiencies.Unfortunately, BARBARIAN isn't just content with idiocy, but, also piles on the most Absurd of plots - even for a horror flick. Even the mildest scrutiny takes apart the premise's logic. As things escalate so does the Absurdity. A movie can survive idiots and absurdity - but, not both. At least not in the case of BARBARIAN.",2022-09-23
"One of, if not THE worst movie I've ever seen. I have no idea what people that enjoyed this piece of human waste were on while watching it, but I'd like to know who their dealer is. Awful plot, full of holes. Awful acting. Zero scary moments. The ending is straight up atrocious. I'm in disbelief after anticipating this one for so long. It's just AWFUL. I want to scream, it ruined my night. Who green lighted this? They should be ashamed of themselves, please, if you're reading this do not pay to see this movie. Don't pay to see it in a theater, at home, anywhere. I wish I had the words to explain just how terrible it was. Made ""The Room"" look like The Godfather.",2022-09-24
"One of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. Almost nothing made sense, there was a huge plot gap (e.g. You could easily predict that the old man was kidnapping women and raping them and that creature was either one of these women or his child but they had to make a scene to make it clear ?).There was no tension, you knew all along there was something going on in the basement and could predict every jump scare... Also the main character was really stupid and unrealistic, she was ""scared and wanted it to end"" but made it back to the house again even though she knew something was off. I do not recommend watching...",2022-11-05
Looks like most people agree with me. Dumb characters doing stupid things. Had some potential but bad script writing and sophomoric directing torpedoed it. How do Hollywood people spend so much on effects and costumes but don't fix plot holes that would take 5 minutes to work around?Worse than the talentless writers/producers/directors are the professional critics that give movies like this great reviews. I wonder what wrong in their childhoods that led to such superficial evaluations. I was duped out of my $15. Worse is the fact that my money substantiates this drivel. My wife wanted to walk out halfway through and laughed hysterically at all the nonsensical acts. Really bad movie.,2022-09-17
"So it starts out decently good with a very nice twist because most people's common sense would point towards the guy being the evil dude, then out of the blue the guy gets killed by something else. Ok nice nice and then the movie completely drops this scene to go into something else completely unrelated but somewhat connected.Too many things unanswered and too many hoops to jump thru to make this believable. Also that's not how inbreeding would work out lolYou mean to tell that two people went missing, and their last known location was this house and nobody came looking for these missing people? With those inept cops of course but that wouldn't stop there. How can the monster also stop the fall of something that fell before them, and it isn't a long distance either so no the woman would have gone splat.Also that character that tries to rescue the people has a lot of blame for what happens in the movie by just acting as a bystander and not trying to do anything about what he knows is going on.Save your time and watch something else.",2023-08-18
"Original, creepy and great atmosphere. This film is enjoyable. Probably not movie theater enjoyable but its a great horror flick. With a solid performance by Bill Skarsgard and an even better performance by Georgina Campbell. Justin Long also did excellent in his role as well.Watch this on HBO max and it was a solid movie. Only one flaw I had a problem with is the whole police scenario. I mean come on its kind of unbelievable but I understand for dramatic reasons.However nonetheless this will give you a few scares and make you rethink about getting that next gorgeous airbnb.

"I'm grateful I watched this movie without seeing any spoilers.Wrecked (2016) is one my favorite TV shows and I loved Zach Cregger's performance in that show. I'm happy for his solo directorial debut. It's still an achievement they were able to make this movie with just $4.5 million. The quality was stellar and impressive. I'm enjoying Bill Skarsgård's successful continuous streak in horror and I'm happy for him. Justin Long's return to horror is exciting and I hope to see him more. Zach Kuperstein's brilliant cinematography with impressive and experimental camera shots with jaw-dropping goodness was one of the main attractions of this movie.Review for first and second act; A meticulously crafted, shocking and extremely thrilling horror with an immersive music + sound and a perfect cast that delivered a fantastic performance.Review for third act; A rushed, sloppy, unsatisfied and a disappointing ending with so much to unpack. Third act totally ruined the whole movie for me.",2022-10-27
"An unnerving thriller with twists and turns you won't see coming. Barbarian"" stands out thanks to its stellar performances, gorgeous visuals, and surprisingly effective dashes of humour. To sum up the film, I'd say it has a great first-half, a middling middle, and a little underwhelming conclusion. In the end, I couldn't shake the feeling that the film's latter half doesn't match up to the promise of its first thirty minutes. In most cases, this would make for a subpar experience, but for ""Barbarian,"" the strengths' mostly make up for its shortcomings.Enjoyable and worth checking out at least once, but the film is ultimately let down by a couple of flaws that prevent it from being genuinely outstanding.Rating: 7.2/10 (Good)",2022-10-25
"After just watching ""Smile"" miss its mark, I was pleased to see director/writer's Zach Cregger mostly hit the mark with ""Barbarian"". This movie has a few problems, but there's quite a bit to like for horror/thriller fans. Many horror movies suffer from the idiot victim syndrome in which the characters undersiege are made to make ill-thought out or brainless decisions to keep the story moving. For top of the line horror movies, this is usually non-existent or completely minimized. ""Barbarian"" has some of those brainless moments. But What it does have is a very strong beginning and lead-up. Also enjoyed the back story. See for yourself. I liked ""Black Phone"" as the best horror of the year, but Barbarian is decent. Georgina Campbell reminds of a Halle Berry a bit. Not for the faint of heart with graphic violence. Score it about 7/10.",2022-11-19
"The movie starts off full of suspense and with the right tone. But then that's where it hits its height. The nemisis is repulsive and disgusting, yet disappointing and uninteresting. The context and setting are unconvincing and weird, and unusual things are presented without being sufficiently explained or intuitively underatood in context. The movie in general lacks taste and is apparently confused about its own perspective, such that as a viewer you find yourself unsure as to make what of whom. I really wish I never wasted my time watching it, as I neither felt amused nor found anything to even disconnectedly observe and admire.",2022-11-12
"There were some good bits to this movie, The set up first 1/4 was pretty good. And Justin Long's A hole character was played really well, loved him singing passionately the incomprehensible meaningless lyrics loudly in the car at the beginning of his scene and his character had a lot of detail and layers, thinking he's a good guy, being mostly oblivious etc, and a bold move to make him a Weinstein dude. Too soon?The bad was the cheese stuff, that was ok for horror effect but kinda trashed the believablilty of the set up.How was she so strong. She lived in tunnels underground. I didn't see a fitness gym where she worked out between protein shakes. Strong enough to rip the arm off someone and beat them to death with it. It was funny but, it went into cartoon territory.It was mostly well done but on reflection wasn't as clever as it could have been.And she was cut in half by a car, fell off a 4 story tower with someone on top of her, and she still lived?",2022-10-29
"It's a Bit of a Mixed Bag for me. There is Some really Great Stuff in this Horror Movie and then There is One or Two Scenes That Are just Ridiculous.Things that Were Strong -1. The Sounds of the Dark Sexual Assault Screams in the Opening Logo and in Certain Parts Really Sets a Sinister Tone.2. The Score is Great.3. The First Set up with the Lead Woman Character Unexpectedly Finding some Guy Staying at the House Is Really Good and Sets Up the Tone and Has This Slow Build To the Basement Secrets.4. The Plot is Very Good and The Twist is Horrifying.😱5. The Different Scene Switches adds to Wanting to see Where is The Conclusion to these Scene Switches.6. The Dark Basement Scenes were Scary as Hell at First BEFORE the Creature Reveal.Things I didn't Like -1. The Thing Jumping off the Water Tower was Absolutely Ridiculous.2. Why did the lead female character keep Going Back into a PITCH BLACK dungeon? Like Seriously?3. The Thing and the Breast Feeding and Baby Bottle just Turns it from Being Scary to Just being Silly.4. The Abrupt Ending and the Cinema Lights immediately Lighting Up.Overall, it Started Strong, has a Good Plot but There are Moments that are Silly and The Water Tower Jump Off Scene was Tonally Ridiculous.",2022-11-09
"These reviewers have to be paid to lie. This movie starts slow, the plot is stupid and it's not scary or funny. Of course the white guy is bad. I'm just wondering who would rent a air b and b in Detroit? DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I am so sick of the lying on this site. I gave it 2 stars only because they had The Northman rated as high and it was the worst movie ever. I gave it a 1 and this movie was twice as good. I wish I could get this time back. I could of been scraping the paint off my house or cleaning my gutters. WAY FUNNER! This is pure trash and I am just trying to fill in the remaining characters.",2022-09-18
"It actually starts off well enough, creepy, understated, unnervering (also has Bill Skarsgard who played Pennywise from the 'IT' films) Had promise but about half way through its switches tone, and more importantly, heroes, and then it becomes less about the horror, and less about people who are actually in peril, and more about people who are to be honest are narcissistic, sociopathic apparently sexual predators. Then said 'hero' accidentally shoots her then throws her off the building.... I'm confused, Who am I rooting for? Certainly not the characters who demanded almost half the screen time.",2022-12-30
"I really wish I could give this a zero. This moving isn't scary. The trailer really hyped up the movie but it did not hold up to expectations. It goes for gross factor, more than a actual horror movie. Some really good actors are in this film and must have owed someone a favor to create this movie. Has all the bad pit falls of low budget horror films. If you like bad horror this is definitely for you. This film leaves you with the thought that they could have done so much with the actors and material they had. Every concept they placed in the film just falls short of being good. Save your time at a Detroit hilly bill incest show.",2022-11-01
"If you are into mystery horror smarty dialogues kind of movies please dont watch this and make my mistake. I had high expectations but it was so boring, no explanation at the scenario, just silly people with no logic or some true mystery behind. Very boring and i prefer to watch movie contratiempo 10 more times than to watch that film. Very cliche movie.If you want to have some laughs at some scenes even for that i dont think its working, it was ridiculus at some scenes but you wont laugh you will just sit there wandering why you push play at the beggining.Anyway if you are 15 years old maybe you like it and you feel some chills.",2023-03-07
The fact that people actually enjoyed this movie is more surprising than the actual movie. When the movie was over i didn't even know it was coming i expected at least thirty more minutes to wrap up the plot & ....nothing. First hour is boring it's just suspense. A low budget horror movie is worse than any other type of low budget movie because it's takes much more effort to get an audience scared than it does to cry & the only thing i felt was bored & disturbed. You might seriously expect something from the dude who played pennywise but his character was boring & awkward same as the main character.,2022-10-31
"After reading some other reviews, I took my chances to a horror flick which I normally don't go out to see in theatres.In general, acting was natural and direction was reasonably good but only for the first hour or so... the scene setup was a bit overdone. I mean why would someone consider even renting out an air bnb out in a deserted street with wrecked homes? Not natural right? Would you ever do that?The buildup to the climax was slow and just the right pace, nothing supernatural about this horror. The three main characters were on the mark on acting. It was going well to be a 7/10 rated movie for me... well until the last scenes, where everything falls apart.... How does anyone survive falling from what looked like at least 30+ foot height... And still be strong enough to crush open someone's head with their bare hands. The scene with the old owner living in the basement since the 1980s did not seem right either. The guy looked pretty old even back in the scene when Reagan was apparently the president.The reaction of the cop being asked for help was strangely unnatural. Most people who work in law enforcement do not act that callous towards someone reaching out to them in desperation... let alone threatening to arrest the person asking for help. Bad writing.But the bigger question that got unanswered was: who was behind the sinister double booking to begin with. The property manager surely didn't think anyone should be there. The old guy bedridden in the basement didn't look too tech savvy to be orchestrating all this.So yeah... I'd give it a 5 / 10 overall. A little more work in writing and direction towards the end of the movie could have easily made it 7 / 10, which is what I define as a good movie, to put it simply.",2022-09-16
"I feel that ""Barbarian"" is a divisive film: you either love it, or you hate it completely, because of how the story is developed. The editing might be confusing at times, but the director does a nice job in collecting the pieces together and by the end you have a clear and complete picture of what happened. Considering that a lot of horrors nowadays just force you to go along with the story, without asking questions about what you watched, this script is a huge accomplishment for the genre. The plot is captivating and it has a lot of twists, as at first you do not really understand who is the antagonist of this story. Towards the middle section there is a sudden change of scenery that leaves me a bit disoriented. However, as said before, everything that is shown has a purpose and I feel that screenwriters really did a good job in developing this script. I felt genuine terror, as Zach Cregger uses locations and lights to scare the audience, by barely showing some strange shapes. The monster reveal is perhaps a bit cliche, but it works greatly in the context. There are no cheap jumpscares. The photography is amazing and the POV shots are intense. However, I feel that some camera works have been a bit overused, therefore they lost their effectiveness.I am always happy when big actors such as Bill Skarsgård take part in these smaller projects, bringing potentially more attention to niche production. Matthew Patrick Davis as the creature was fantastic and I really like his performance. I felt entertained, and I think that this is one of the most interesting horror productions that was recently released. I will not just forget, because it has some original elements that make it stand out. My final score is 7.2.",2023-09-21
"Knowing nothing about this film works great. I haven't seen any promotional material and gave this film a go solely based on this site's recommendations. It worked nicely since you can put yourself in the main character's shoes and be as confused as her, trying to uncover what is actually going on.Overall the film was good but very uneven in its parts. The structure was quite interesting, the beginning was intriguing, and we almost concluded the main character's story. Still, then the movie like restarted and introduced us to another one. That confused me, but it all made sense in the end.I think the idea was to trick the audience into thinking this was a standard gory torture thriller (again, I haven't seen the trailer). But instead, it turned out to be a tale about trusting people buffed by spelled-out social commentary. It was a little too obvious but effective enough, and the characters worked for me. If you try to understand their motivations, their decisions don't seem that stupid, and the opening scenes are reasonably well-developed.The ending felt a little too comical, even in how it was shot, but still good enough.Overall, if you buy the somewhat questionable premise, everything else fits into the film's overall theme. Great horror? Probably not for horror fans. Good mystery film? Yes. Social undertones? More like loud overtones, but still ok.Not great, not terrible, but it felt more like a real movie, not generic content to fill watching hours. They knew what they were doing, and it worked for me.",2022-11-18
"A roller coaster ride of a movie with all sorts of twists and turns. It wouldn't be a horror movie if people acted sensibly. So get that notion out of your heads right away. Of course, people go back into scary house basements. That's half the fun--- watching dopey people do dopey things.This one throws in bits of Psycho, Silence of the Lambs and a few other alone-in-the-house routines, you are all familiar with. I had to close my eyes several times things got so creepy.Well-made and well-acted. I enjoyed it immensely. Would make a nice double bill with this year's other things that go bump in the basement flick, the Black Phone. Set aside your logical mind and just sit back and get scared right outt of your pants.",2022-10-09
"Please, DO NOT waste your time or money watching this supposed horror flick. It was an hour and forty-two minutes of my life that I'll never get back. The screenplay, script, cinematography,...the movie....straight up garbage. An incohesive horror movie that by far is one of the worst that I've seen as far back as I can remember. A total waste of use of Bill Skarsgård and Justin Long. I spent the entire duration of the movie waiting for any resemblance of a scare or even gore, less a couple scenes that seemed to be recycled from other horror movies. I left the cinemas very irritated and disappointed.",2022-10-04
"First half was an okay setup.Second half was filled with some of worst written characters and clichés that existed only to make the plot work.The entire city of detroit was full over a convention. Yeah right.The tunnel system is completely ridiculous. A killer dungeon wouldn't dig hundreds of feet of straight pointless tunnel. I would take a lifetime.The cops disregarding her claims is completely ludicrous.Literally all they had to do was take her name and check the system for a missing persons report, or hell even just run her license plate through the system to get her ID. Her car was right there and even rented would still be in her name.Then there's the complete invincibility of the mother character that isn't malnourished or weak but some kind of hulk that brushes off a spine and leg shattering crash before falling 100 feet on concrete without any problems.Not to mention how cringingly stupid the hobo gets his arm ripped off scene was, or AJ throwing the main character off the storage tank for 'bait' and the mother just jumps off with her.I could literally go on and on. If the door to the basement is locked from outside, how is the mother roaming the streets every night.Why did the mother kill Keith right away.This entire movie is an infuriating overrated heap of flaming garbage that should've been left in a niche of mediocre movies that no more than a few dozen people will ever see. But here we are with critics somehow fawning over this ridiculous piece of trash.",2022-10-31
"A horror / thriller production that we both said we wanted to see more of in the cinema, during the horror movies conversation we had with Ayhan Salar at the closing party of the Bosphorus Film Festival yesterday...The film, which is director Zach Cregger's solo debut, was inspired by the book The Gift of Fear.The use of clichés never bothers me, the important thing is not to use clichés in a work, but how the clichés are used.Starting with a cliché that has been used many times recently in the opening scene, the film contains clichés of many genres, including Southern Gothic, and as a result of the clever use of these clichés, the film manages to lock the audience on the screen until the end.Every name chosen for the cast does their job very well. (actually he will be in Zac Efraon in the cast)The sound design helped the cinematographer a lot in the dark scenes, and this collaboration is missed in many films.It is not the production's fault that streaming services have not satisfied the audience who consume too much content with the spread of streaming services, movies are not TV series, and instead of trying to make the instant audience happy, they should also make those who watch it happy 100 years later, this should be the point of view.The film, which was completed for 4.5 million dollars at the end of the day, was shown for a limited time in America, Canada and abroad, making 45 million dollars in cinemas and making its producers smile.Which means we'll be watching more of Zach Cregger.",2022-10-29
"It makes Nope seem interesting. And that's saying something. The crowd on opening night was underwhelmed and talking to themselves out the door. What a bitter disappointment. Did they pay a 7 year old to write the ""scary"" part? It was interesting for about 30 minutes then the last 30, which should of been the payoff in a horror film, were a total letdown. The decent acting by the lead couldn't salvage this 4th grade plot. The budget could have been under a thousand bucks. If you didn't money here, I'm truly sorry. Do yourself a favor: Skip this snoozer. Go watch Top Gun Maverick again. You'll thank me.",2022-09-09
"In town for a job interview, a Tess arrives at her Airbnb rental late at night only to find that the house has been mistakenly double-booked and a strange man is already staying there.Against her better judgment, she decides to stay the night anyway, but soon discovers that there is much more to be afraid of in the house than the other house guest......So my opinion (other interpretations are out there), is that this is a social commentary of social media, exposure, and technology, and what helps this film to be this bizarre is the wild way that the story arcs are told.We begin with the second story, where we meet Tess and Keith. They are the most normal people, and when we meet them, we feel, likes this could be the strangest story of the whole film. If the trailers anything to go by, the film is just about these two characters, media and technology playing with the audience.The final story is where we meet AJ, a TV whatever being accused of sexual assault. Again, this is where social media and exposure target him. He seems like the most vulnerable male of the film, but the narrative and the use of in film social media brands him the evilest person of the film.....but all thanks to the way social media depicts him in the film, and this makes him desperate, hence his actions in the film.The first story is set in the eighties, where we see the maybe first owner of the house. Whom we find out to be a killer and and other twisted things. But the amazing thing about this film is that he is never caught thanks to the lack of social media back then.The Mother/beast of the film is subliminally the social media of the film, scared of Brakes Character (obviously social media having nothing on him equals the fear of the unknown), but literally tearing AJ apart.It's a brilliantly made piece of work, harking Psycho, lulling the audience into a false sense of security of whom the main star is, and it's very tense throughout, brilliantly using light to its full effect.It's not a horror in a traditional sense, buts it's one of the most unnerving films I've seen in a while.....",2022-10-30
"Late review but I just have to talk about this movie! It's great and everything I wanted it to be! The story is original, the acting is really good, the pacing is phenomenal, the cinematography is excellent, the horror aspects of the film were really well done and the creepy aspects really did get to me. The humor also works really well and it's much to do with Justin Long. He's awesome! He stole the show for me and made me enjoy this film even more! My only big flaw with the film is that it missing key context. If I get into it, it's spoiler territory. I also have some nitpicks here and there but nothing to drain the overall film. It's a great movie and officially in my Top 5 best from this year!",2022-10-14
"Barbarian couldn't make me feel engaged with it's story. Despite the good camera angles and ideas, the mystery is completely flat, lacks attitude and innovation.It all starts with a promising situation, but at the same time common: a house with something hidden. Nice. The truth? Something ordinary, already explored by the genre.Following the despicable story, the soundtrack mantains itself average: loud when there's a jumpscare.The main characters may give us some depth, but it's not enough to desire them to live.Barbarian shows, again, a good camera work. And thats all. No plot twist, no anxiety from any build up, no thoughtful provoking plot. Just more of the same.",2023-01-05
"If you are a viewer who can't stand to see characters make glaringly bad choices that put themselves in danger unnecessarily, skip this one. The script does try to provide motivation for the numerous stupid decisions, but realize ahead of time that some people in this movie are going to do things no actual person would ever do so that the plot can move forward.There were a lot of effective moments in this film; I thought it built very smartly towards its reveal. Although it does goes slow, it gets very creepy, and the tension became almost unbearable.Then, they play around with structure a little bit to keep you guessing. Any time you think you've started to figure out what the situation is, they throw you off with new complications. I thought it worked as far as a way to keep surprising the audience right through to the end.I appreciated that the filmmakers tried to do things a little different to try to distinguish the movie from the average horror offering. I thought it was fairly original, and also a lot of fun. It is the first film I feel safe recommending in many, many months.One other note: for the folks who didn't think it was realistic that one convention could cause the entire Detroit area to be short of resources, I can tell you that this does happen. My wedding coincided with a golf tournament on the same weekend, and things did not go according to plan.",2022-11-04
"So I vaguely remember hearing about this before, but watched it with my daughter tonight (her recommendation lol). First half of the movie, was pretty decent and creepy/unsettling without even showing anything gorey or gross. BS does a great job with his character and the audience not knowing what to expect, besides ""something is happening"". GC also does a good job, minus the stereotypical horror genre of making dumb decisions.However, once you see a particular room, it was super apparent on what was happening/had happened and it played out (basically) how I thought. But don't worry, the homeless guy character will give you the exposition right before the ending. As other reviewers have commented, its like there's 2 different movies happening.I know with movies you have to ""suspend disbelief"" and the horror genre has ""dumb characters/decisions"" but my god....this movie is ridiculous with both. The first half had promise and is why I only gave this a 5, but the 2nd half..yikes. It just pissed me off, especially the police part.And what's up with JL, terrible horror movie reasons (ie Jeepers Creepers) and dying by the eyes!?",2023-06-13
"Seriously, one of the most nonsensical, boring, ridiculous movies of all time. It wasn't even fun bad, it was just an infuriating waste of time. It was also incredibly pretentious, one of those movies where you can tell the filmmaker thought it was brilliant and off beat and quirky, when really it's just utter garbage.It starts off alright, sure the lead character is a little stupid and there is a really obvious red herring, but I can forgive that if the story at least gets interesting from there, but it doesn't. The beginning in the best part and that isn't saying much at all. There are so many plot holes also, which just add to the badness of the film.Don't watch this.",2022-11-06
"There's a dearth of originality in the horror genre, so I'm always happy to find a movie like Barbarian. It might not have any grand goals of becoming elevated, but it's as entertaining as hell. It twists all the way through to the end, and it stays away from all the dull old tropes that leave everyone's eyes rolling in the aisles. There were a few holes that left me wondering, but beyond that, it's a tight horror.We have two short storylines and a third to bring them together, but there were a few loose ends that would have been intriguing if followed through. The characters are gorgeously developed, too. In a way, I wish this was a limited series so we could really delve into every element of the film.If there were more original movies in the genre, I would have given this a six, but there isn't, so I didn't. It deserves at least one star for the discipline involved in refusing to be lazy like most horrors are.",2022-10-26
"I first heard about this movie from an instagram review and to be honest it sounded quite interesting. The idea with which the film begins hasn't been explored much so I thought it was original. But the moment things started to unveil all the creepiness of the movie disappeared. I was left with an awkward feeling and nothing short to disappointment. By the end I realised just how many plot holes it had which added up to the overall unsatisfying experience.I wouldn't recommend watching it. And to be honest I am surprised there are so many good reviews. People calling it a masterpiece and so on...
In conclusion go check some other films of the same genre or go into this one with really low expectations. Who knows? Maybe this way it would be enjoyed more.",2022-11-06
"I did not know much about this movie because the trailer was surprisingly vague, and I only read the IMDB synopsis that does not reveal too much. I am glad I did not know much about this movie because it kept surprising me from beginning to end.Georgina Campbell and Bill Skarsgård both had good performances, and I liked it when their two characters interacted with each other. Justin Long is also in the movie, which I will not spoil, but I liked his character and what he brought to the movie.The movie starts like how you thought but when it gets to the second and third act it has surprises that are disturbing and creepy but got me even more invested in what was happening. There are brutal violent moments, but they only happen when they need to make the scenes even more disturbing.You start to understand more about what is in these dark tunnels in the Airbnb along with seeing what this thing looks like, which will disturb people. If you cannot handle disturbing creepy scenes, then you should not watch this movie.Barbarian (2022) was a surprising horror movie that I thought was fun to watch, and other people will like this movie too. I recommend going into this movie without knowing much because it gives you a better horror movie experience.",2023-01-04
"The film opens with a woman showing up at her airbnb, in a dilapidated section of Detroit, on a dark and stormy night, only to discover that it has already been rented to another man.Unable to get through to the owners, they agree to share the accommodation.But then weird stuff starts to happen.Doors open and close on their own.She finds a hidden room in the basement, that looks like a cell in which someone had been kept imprisoned.And there's an angry homeless man telling her she shouldn't be going in that house.So it's not a stretch to say that the whole place gives off major HH Holmes murder castle vibes.That is, if it isn't just a straight up portal to hell.After she gets trapped in the basement...he goes to investigate...only to disappear...which draws her down a deep dark tunnel...into what seems like an abyss.And let's just say that was a pretty big mistake...At this point the narrative switches, to follow a tv producer, who is getting dragged through the media with sexual assault charges.Turns out he is the owner of the property in question.Who travels to Detroit, to liquidate the asset, so as to drum up some funds for his defense.By this point, the two tenants are nowhere to be found.But their stuff is still there.And he can hear something rummaging around in the basement.He thinks he has squatters.But little does he know, that the truth is much more nefarious.So he goes to investigate...completely unaware of what lies in store for him...And what ensues, is some genuinely creepy stuff.We get a bit of backstory about the property via a very stylishly shot flashback sequence...which informs us that the house's original owner was very much of the HH Holmes ilk.A stalker, conman, and kidnapper...among other things...which only come into context later in the film.And this is (apparently) only scratching the surface...The interesting thing here, is that the monster of the film, is not the barbarian in question.In fact, we are made to feel empathy for her...as she is a rather misunderstood character, who just wants to experience love.The real barbarians being the two male antagonists of the film.Their misogyny and incel lifestyle, being what makes them qualify as such.Thus putting this film on par with films like Frankenstein, King Kong, and Godzilla...in that the follows the trope that real monsters are almost always human.In the end, this film is legitimately scary, and wrought with high tension.The type of film that will have you yelling at the screen, when the characters make questionable decisions, that put their lives in danger.By the time it was ending...I couldn't fathom that it was actually over...because I was ready to sit through another hour, at least.No joke.As they were just getting into the lore...and it was just starting to get interesting.When all is said and done, however, it leaves a number of loose ends completely untouched.So I can only imagine they are setting themselves up for a sequel.They simply have to.As it ends way too abruptly.With that being said, though...if you want to watch a scary movie this Halloween season...look no further than this film.Because it is definitely one of the scariest movies of 2022.6.5 out of 10 (and that's taking all the loose ends it leaves us with, into consideration).",2022-10-31

You will find out after see it. Can somebody remove human arm from the shoulder with bare hand? Ohh maybe only hulk can do that?! Lots of unanswered questions like who put the house on airbandb?!

"RESERVED ONLY FOR HORROR FANS.Using clever cinematography and an unconventional approach to well-trodden horror tropes, BARBARIAN offers more than mere cheap thrills or jump scares. (In fact, one major critique is that the film's second half is not even sufficiently scary.) BARBARIAN effectively uses the horror genre as a springboard for trenchant but not always well-formulated social commentary. Nevertheless, it is well paced, engaging, and ambitious.Very original storyline! Unexpected events alert. If you want to see a good modern horror movie, this is the one.Really different from the usual horror movie. The trailer doesn't give too much away so you don't really know what to expect. It's really well shot and produced. Definitely recommend to any horror fans!",2022-11-01
"I enjoyed the start, the two main characters kept me guessing, was one of them bad, my husband predicting the clown from IT was evil as he had played the evil character before. I liked his character and was hoping he was good, but surely the young lady wasn't bad. It kept me glued. Then the film changed pace completely after my questions were answered. I knew it was a horror, I knew from all other horror films that things don't need to make sense and if you want it to, then like all other horrors, this isn't the one for you. But I enjoyed finding out where this would go and where it ended up. It could have gone in so many directions but a quarter of the way, even half the way through I couldn't have predicted it. That's what I liked about it, although to some, I can see that they want no flaws and everything to make sense in a horror. Cinema is not real life, movies are not real life.

i now rank this as the worst film i have ever seen.....and i am still wondering how it was even made

"This movie was recommended by many reviewers and critics. It was billed as the scariest horror movie of 2022 and ranked in the top 5 of need to see flicks on many sites.Oooh, one so so jump scare in the first third of the movie. Then a flashback scene worse than a Law and Order neighbor telling the detectives the behavior of their nextdoor neighbor from their point of view.The final third is more an attempt at a gross out than horror. Mothers milk from an inbred hostage followed by a (I already figured that out 40 mins ago) video montage of other hostages. And where did the 10 miles of underground tunnels, secret rooms and electrical cables that don't appear to be strung except at the tunnel entrance and dead end room.Add to that a final battle sequence, falling from great highs only to get the wind knocked out of the fighters and the most inept police officers since Car 54 Where are You. Skarsgard went from playing one of the scariest horror villains to Abbott and Costello meet the Milkmaid from Hell. A total waste of time.",2022-11-22
"When I go to a horror movie, I expect to get horror or gore. This movie didn't even raise my heart rate once the entire movie. Most of the movie was just extra fluff trying to explain the plot of the movie. There was maybe 20 min of actual horror/gore in the entire movie. The scariest part of the entire movie( which really wasn't scary imo) was halfway into the movie, and lasted about 15 sec, before it cut away to a serene scene to bring another character into the movie. Based on the trailer, and all the critic reviews of the movie, I expected the movie to be good. I felt like I wasted about 2 hours of my time on this movie. I am lucky I had AMC A-list, so the only thing I lost was time. Wouldn't recommend to any horror fan. You will be very disappointed.",2022-09-11
"Overall: 7.42An inventive and original modern horror tale, which is truly scary, and offers great WTF moments along the way that make it a truly fun and lasting experience. Direction and editing are great, you are immediately immersed in the thrill and mystery with the horror always looming which adds an enthralling experience for the viewer as you navigate the corners of a perfectly crafted Airbnb set along with the lead Actor (Georgina Campbell). The movie is truly scary with an incredible supporting cast (Bill Skarsgard, Justin Long, and Richard Brake) but sometimes relieves the audience from its tension and dread to follow other linear plot lines or backstories. The final act slips a little into basic horror tropes and horror campiness but overall it's originality prevails and leaves a huge stamp on the horror genre for years to come, and is a must-see for anyone intrigued.Setting, Conflict, Character, Dialogue, Theme, Plot, and Climax: B+Audience Engagement (do you feel runtime): NoTop Genres - Horror, Mystery, Thriller

"The way this film starts off leads you into every trope of horror movies ever seen. Girl agrees to stay overnight with stranger, girl investigates cries for help in long black corridor, girl escapes but goes back etc etc
However it's done really well and the initial scenes convince you the film is taking a certain direction, but then it veers off into something completely different.The only real plot mystery is that 1 of the characters just disappears with no explanation.That said it had me on the edge of my seat a couple of times and although it's never going to sit beside the Shining or Exorcist it's not a bad movie at all. Justin Long takes the edge off it as he always does, but not enough to ruin it.I've given it a 5 because it's not really bad, but it's not great.",2022-12-25
"It is a dark night. Rain and thunder clouds. A double booked airbnb appears to be the only place for Tess(Campbell, driven) to stay overnight until she can go to her job interview. But will she be safe there?Some of the stuff that scares you the most watching this is the music and the cinematography. You can really see inspiration from John Carpenter for both. The score also does sound somewhat like early Silent Hill Otherworld chaotic, if less ""noisy"". Characters in this are either sympathetic or interesting a-holes.On at least one occasion, it will suddenly jump to a different POV. This has and will bother a number of viewers. Personally, I found that the bold decision, like all of the subtle setup, paid off. The social commentary is handled well. It's not preachy and it goes into extremely relevant topics.This features strong violence gore, nudity and language. I recommend this to any fan of horror. 10/10.",2022-12-31
"""Ma maaaaaaah"" lol ""She wants you to be her baby!"" ""Just drink it!""Then the credits rolled and I hear ""Be my little babyyyy"" being played. I totally lost it and just could not quit laughing.Justin Long was great. He wasn't scared at all! Hell man! It's time to measure! I'm here to liquidate! Gotta get that square footage in to pay for litigation! LolIt's definitely worth a wait til it hits Netflix kinda deal. But hey, if you're up for it like I was, go ahead and see it! Good horror movies are in short supply. They don't all have to be scary. Some of the funny ones can be entertaining. I thought it was funny throughout the second half of the movie. For others, maybe it won't be so funny. Maybe I set the bar too high for what scary actually is?On a serious note, I did like how they pieced the movie together though. Damn good job on the makeup!I am wondering though, is this just a typical day in suburban Michigan? Lol What's the housing market like there right now? Maybe I should go flip some houses?! But first, I'm gonna be damn sure to check those basements! If I find a secret room, a bed, a bucket, and an old VHS camera...I'm out Jack! See ya!",2022-09-13
"I'm not sure that I saw the same movie as everyone who left raving reviews. The first quarter of the movie was great, it took its time building suspense and a feeling of unease, and then the rest was filled with cheap jump scares and moments that left more questions than answers. I felt like revealing the monster immediately removed all sense of fear of her, and I was no longer able to suspend my disbelief. The homeless man stating that ""she's not the worst thing down there"" gave me some hope that they were going to bring back that fear that the beginning gave, but ultimately it was just the old man, and he killed himself within 5 minutes of being onscreen. The movie left a lot of elements unexplored, and the breastfeeding scene was a bit much.",2022-10-24
"Barbarian is a pretty good movie with good caliber and good quality horror. It's a dark and scary movie with very intense scenes. Good direction, good script, good editing, good atmosphere, good makeup effects and good performances. At the beginning it starts normal and nothing interesting happens until little by little things go up a notch. Everything becomes dark and intense. Justin Long is the funniest part of the film with his somewhat exaggerated character. Barbarian is a promising, fresh and original horror film that ensures a good amount of tension. My final rating for this movie is 9/10.",2023-03-23
"What I really enjoyed about this movie is the jumpscares and how it's dark and terrifying the mother of the creature was in the movie.The performance of Georgia Campbell, Bill Skarsgård, and Justin Long was good, the writing was scary, the story was amazing, and this movie was really unforgettable for bringing the best classic horror jumpscare to ever experience to the big screen and the small screen.Writer and Director Zach Cregger, did a splendid job with his work of horror genre! Now this is the kind of horror movie to watch for Halloween, but just to make sure for all the horror fans out there. Please make sure to never, ever watch it alone.",2022-10-29
"The first 45 minutes of this is a tense, claustrophobic horror, with naturalistic dialogue and performances. A relationship develops between the two leads and we are left with an amazing swerve at the end of the first act.Then the movie changes to your average Blumhouse nonsense. The performances change to be hammy and pedestrian. The direction switches from something interesting and tense to bog standard. The story breaks down into something trying to be clever and challenging, when it is in fact nothing more interesting than any given Netflix-made shocker, or straight-to-Amazon feature. It goes from brilliant to so-so in the space of a single cut-to-black and the start of a new scene.I wouldn't avoid it. I'd watch the first 45 minutes (for which this gets 5/5) and ignore the rest (which gets 2/5). Yep- I'm scoring this as two distinct movies.",2022-12-17
"9/23/23 Amended review. It doesn't make a lot sense sometimes like many films in this genre, but it works! It is very, very effective when putting various people in peril and for that we owe thanks to a first time feature film director and long time actor, Zach Cregger, who also wrote this. He will be in demand as a director after this. The setting is creepy and just gets creepier and creepier as it goes along. Its characters do some of the usual stupid things that they do in films such as this, but it doesn't matter as it all works. My only real annoyance was the behavior of the police officers which to me just didn't ring true. The cast is excellent starting with Georgina Campbell in the lead. Equally affecting are Bill Skarsgard in a surprising role and Justin Long in a despicable one. I've seen so many horror and suspense films over decades that being truly frightened is a near impossibility, but I found my hands gripping the arms of my chair a few times while viewing this.",2022-11-01
"When you are watching a horror film, you expect people to make stupid mistakes. But the main character can't do something stupid. And then the next thing is stupid. And then the next thing stupid. And everything after is stupid.That is the way this film pans out. This was an extremely frustrating film to watch, with poor decision after poor decision. The ""suspenseful"" scenes of dark passageways were way too long (I kept fast forwarding). The ""monster reveal"" was ill-timed and anti climactic.But what is most egregious is that the entire premise of the movie (and trailer) is completely unrelated to the plot of the movie. This movie hs nothing to do with a double-booked rental home, or the chance meeting of two like-minded individuals.This movie is a poor attempt to humanize a social media obsessed culture who feign connections due to common interest. This movie was terrible and a complete waste of time.",2022-10-28
"I didn't know much about this move going in, just that my wife wanted to go see a movie and heard it was good. First thing I loved, was that it was set in Detroit. Having grown up in Detroit it was a pleasant surprise, with the police interaction being way too accurate for my taste. It definitely has twists and turns. I did not expect the story to go the way it did. So props there as most horror/thrillers are quite predicable for the most part. Acting was fabulous, no complaints there.My issue with the movie is tied to 1) The ending, and 2) decisions made by the characters.1) The ending feels very unsatisfying. After all the fighting and terror, all it took to bring down the ""monster"" was a simple gunshot to the head. And no real follow up on anything (ex. Whose the guy that was trying to call her in the beginning?)2) Maybe I'm just scared naturally and know Detroit too well for my own good to understand that if there is anything like a door in the basement or anything remotely creepy you DO NOT ENTER! I just kept thinking there is no way a normal/rational human being would go exploring. I would have called the police the second I found the sex dungeon and left it at that. Though I will admit the cops would probably just write it off as a normal ""Detroit basement."" Also, knowing Detroit, I'm well aware other much safer neighboring towns would have available hotels. She would be able to figure out the ""safeness"" of where to go from google. Simple. Detroit has a rep, well deserved, and a simple google search would tell you which areas are safe. I'm surprised the Airbnb reviews didn't mention the condition of the neighboorhood, but whatever, I'm probably getting too analytical at this point.Bottom line, movie is enjoyable if you don't think about it too much.",2022-10-05
"I read some reviews here and don't get some of the hate, are people really picking on everything and saying it couldn't happen? Because you can do this with ANY movie. The movie was quite creepy, fans of the horror genre for sure will enjoy. I just wish the story about the Barbarian (seems like some didn't get who's supposed to the barbarian, probably texting during the whole movie...) could have had more depth. All in all, I think it's a solid 7/10 movie, it had potencial to be better but in the end I think it was definitely one of the best horror movies of the year. And it's definitely the kind of movie it's better to see without knowing what you're getting into!",2022-10-28
"""Barbarian"" looked good in the trailers. Which did what they should, and didn't give away too much. So whether you like the movie or not will really be based on its reveals.It's a slow burner. In some ways maybe a bit too slow. But there's great suspence as it gets darker and darker. Which is good.There is one unintentionally hilarious moment in the middle of the movie that might put many of it. But I was still intrigued enough by the story.There's also alot of characters creeping around places they shouldn't which usually gets annoying in horror movies. But overall the film is entertaining and memorable compared to all the other horrors out there. So worth a watch.",2022-11-03
"Barbarian represents that feeling of ""I want but I can't"". The elements proposed for this film are interesting at the beginning, creating a correct atmosphere of suspense, thriller and mistery that are destroyed for the most common and cliche mistakes that most of these movies face.What mistakes? The obvious contradictions of some situations and how the characters interact and act in the middle of those moments. There is not any kind of ""COHERENCE"" about what a character is living and how they decide to act. When the beginning of the movie seems to show you that there will be a conscious development of the events. They are fastly broken, destroying all the good idea planed at the start.It is sad because some of the actor and actresses do a really good job. But the way the story develops from the second part of the movie is a non-sense.",2022-12-13
"If you want to witness the dumbest characters in the history of dumb characters in horror movies, then this one is for you. They were 10 times dumber than the classic 80s horror movies where we expected dumb decisions because that's when they developed the concepts. This movie goes so far beyond that in the realm of stupid decisions. It became a comedy for me. So if you wanna laugh at decent actors with good careers, clearly wanting to just make anything to get a paycheck then go for it. Don't say I didn't warn you that this is a complete waste of your time. As for all the reviews that say there were multiple twists and edge of your seat viewing ha ha ha ha ha. No twists and I mean no twists. They basically show you the monster and her absolutely impossible strength just to move a ridiculous storyline along. But now I know if I ever fall off of a water tower 60 feet up or so I just need to land on an inbred mutant and I'll be just fine I can walk to the nearest gas station. I could go on but I don't want my review to be as ridiculously stupid as this movie was . Enjoy!",2022-10-27
"This film starts with potential. Keeping you guessing what's been happening, where is it going, is there a villain, who the villain is etc etc etc.Halfway through I was bored. Characters' behaviours are what you usually comment as ""let's move the plot along by having them do something stupid and unjustified"". Just for the sake of the plot.The second half is what you might call a random, left with no plot twist in my head king of progression.If you want to watch idiotic, shallow, unthinking characters fall into deadly mistakes this film is for you.There are no surprises whatsoever, no character or plot twists and you basically know what's going on 40 minutes in.Total waste of time, actors and money spent on financing this.Messy, irrelevant, predictable.",2022-10-30
"This was an awesome horror movie.You shouldn't go into this move knowing any more than the basic plot line: A woman staying at an Airbnb discovers that the house she has rented is not what it seems.This is not a slow-burner. You get a creepy feeling from the start.30 minutes inn the psychological anticipation for what is going to happen next is nerve shattering and director Zach Cregger manages to keep the tension rising throughout this film.On the graphic side it got some gore and on the psychological side it takes its toll.And it does it good!Great performances by Georgina Campbell, Bill Skarsgård and Justin Long.Any horror fan should watch this one.Possibly the best horror film 2022.",2022-10-27
"Starts off with promise but very rapidly becomes a farce, anyone who says otherwise is either very easily scared/impressed or is being paid to do so. Garbage, and should be embarrassment to all involved...I don't want to go on and waste more of my life on this film, and I rarely write reviews but felt the need to spare people this nonsense...and I need 250 more words so I will use those to beg you not to waste any hours, minutes, or seconds if your life on this film. I love horror movies and I appreciate some are lauded for their originality or added farce but this film is neither is these, it's just so so bad...that it has awards attached is beyond comprehension!!!",2022-12-18
"This film does many things right, but it mainly has an absolutely incredible first act. It is very well directed, uses horror clichés to make you think one thing, and is smartly written. We follow two characters, as the guy is made to seem like a creepy person trying to lure the main woman into her demise. This is all instantly subverted in the ending of the first act when he goes into a weird passageway, and is found running away in a panic saying that ""someone bit him"" and a terrifying tall woman brutally kills him in front of the main woman.After this we get a fairly good second act where we follow the owner of the house, having been accused of bad things and trying to make money, discovering this hidden passage and wanting to use it for profit. He too discovers the weird lady down there and gets trapped with our original woman lead from the beginning.We then cut to a flashback in a different aspect ratio depicting the house many years ago right before Detroit hit it's insane decline, where we notice the owner of the house creepily eyeing a woman.This flashback is when the movie becomes problematic for me, this flashback seems like it'll be revisited but this is all we see. It does add slightly more context, but is really just a guy walking to a store and back, not actually more insight on what he was doing to these woman in the house.We then cut back to the present where the main lady manages to escape and gets the cops, but she follows the ultimate cliché of making herself sound crazy and not saying the right thing. If she said to the cops ""Me and another guy went to this air bnb, you can see our cars right here, we both got kidnapped, he's dead, there's another person trapped in there, and I escaped through that window"" they would HAVE to investigate, instead she says all the wrong things. This movie went from subverting clichés in its first act to relying off them.The guy accused of bad stuff gets the opportunity to escape and finds an old man (the guy from the flashback) living down there, and finds VHS tapes of him doing presumably horrible things, but I was a bit disappointed as we never get to see what is on these VHS tapes. The old man then shoots himself, leaving the other guy with a gun.When the woman goes back to find the guy in the basement, she gets shot by him on accident, but they end up escaping and are helped out by a homeless guy from earlier in the movie who is aware of the presence of this weird lady. Turns out this lady is some sort of incest weird animal thing that the old man created from lots of testing, and this is when the movie tries to become very campy.The old man thinks he knows a safe space but gets attacked and killed, another big cliché, (also why was he the only one staying around the area if he knew this lady came out at night) and then the accused guy conveniently drops the gun, leading to him sacrificing the woman so he can hopefully escape. This doesn't work and he gets killed, so apparently that character development from earlier of him trying to help people meant nothing, he just only cared about himself in the end. The woman then shoots the lady and the movie ends.Like I said, I like the pure terror you get in the first act, and how scary some of the second act is. But the third act can't figure out its tone. I like campy horror movies, X for example was great, Malignant was great, but this one felt off. It didn't have the proper character development and had a lot of plot holes.I do think this was an entertaining movie, I probably just wouldn't rewatch it, unlike a movie that I think fully rewards rewatches in a similar subversion type way like Parasite, Malignant, etc.",2022-09-24
This movie starts off great but you pretty much saw this part in the previews. Rather than continuing down that path it gets really bad. Nothing like bringing a comedian in to try and make a horror movie. It looks like the review bot are out in force to boost the ratings for this one. I really did like the direction it was going in the first third.SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINTThere was a good build with the premise of showing up to an Airbnb and having someone else already staying there. But once they find the secret passage and the jump to the next part of the story it goes off the rails with information that isn't needed and loses any sense of suspense.,2022-10-30

"I am not usually a fan of horror movies, I find them poorly executed, Nonsensical, trying too hard to scare, shocking and gory just for the sake of it and above all not scary.This had your typical non eventful jump scares at the start but i do feel they were there to make sure you knew what you were watching is horror.What makes it scary is every bit of plot is believable and you are not dealing with something supernatural.It's very tense and you get a bit deeper each time. The plot sort of moves two steps forward one step back.The whole Air bnb is excellent, this could easily happen.I found myself shouting things like ""Just get out of the house"" ""the guy told you not to go back at dark"" and ""if the baby's scared to go in there, dont go in there""I do think it got a bit silly towards the end though.Everything up to the point where the baby type thing survived being crushed with a car was believable and logical and that's what made it scary.Then after that point it just became like every other rubbish horror film.",2023-01-31
"The originality of this script/plot alone automatically put it at a 6. So many horror films these days are god awful and predictable. Snooze feats galore. But this one kept me on the edge of my seat or glancing at my phone because my anxiety was so high. The ""jump"" scares were genuinely terrifying and unpredictable. I didn't see half the twists coming. And I loved that. And the acting?? It was *chef's kiss."" The people leaving these nonsense 1 star reviews are probably just total Chads that identify way too closely with Justin Longs character. Ignore those fools. This movie is well worth the watch.",2022-10-27
"The movie seems to be completely predictable but it's anything but predictable. No CGI to be found as well, which I found so wonderful! This is a movie to go to, squirm uncomfortably in your seat while eating popcorn at the completely bizarre on goings the movie provides.Warning: You will talk to the characters in the movie. You will yell at them. You will say ""WTF"" quite a few times. Isn't that what a good movie is supposed to do?This is like a roller coaster ride that is in the complete dark where you try to predict where and when the turn is coming. Often, your prediction will be wrong and you are completely unprepared for the jarring results when the turn comes.I will not mention any characters, actors or any plot points. You need to go into the movie completely blind.What a wonderful movie!",2022-10-22
"The first 30-40 minutes are very interesting, and set up what I had assumed to be an interesting last 60 minutes. But no, they don't.The last half of the movie takes all the energy and build up away from the movie, leaving us with a stupid and disengaging last 40 minutes.After the good start, we are ultimately left with a couple of newer characters we don't care about and 1 character who should have driven away after her interview.The back story of the whole weirdness is rushed into a 5 minute flashback, and even then it's not weird enough to really warrant sticking it out for the last 40 minutes.I gave it a 6 because it showed promise at the start, but I don't recommend this movie.",2023-01-11
"Started off so well but just turned into an absolute mess. There were so many stupid decisions in this film by the characters and so many plot holes.1, why did nobody notice the house was in a ghetto until the next day?2. It was never explained how they got double booked into the house
3. Why are the police always so dumb? A woman tells them she has been held captive and they don't believe her and leave here at the house.4.why has the mother got super human strength and able to rip people's arms off and jump 10feet in the air?5How does the girl survive a gun shot and being thrown off a silo?6 why does the guy who has lived in the street for years never report it?7 If the mother comes out and night and captures them, why were they both left alone on the first night?First 30 minutes were actually good but then it just went silly, you'll find yourself laughing and shouting at the screen at how stupid they are.",2022-10-29
"Horror movies, especially in the 21st century, seem to consistently get stuck on the final act. An hour of solid build-up, and then a final half hour running through cliches. Barbarian is the next in line to suffer from this.There are a lot of positives about this film. Zach Cregger has a lot of talent, and it's all on display in the first 40mins of this film. Tension between two characters who know as much about each other as we do. Is Keith up to something sinister or is it just Bill Skasgard's legacy in movies creeping us out? It's slow and builds gradually and naturally, with excellent use of negative space constantly making you look behind the two characters. The set design is also incredible, the neighbourhood looking post apocalyptic, and you can see influences from Twin Peaks to Psycho to Hereditary. There's also a clever subtext on the tension between men and women in a post MeToo world.It truly is a great movie, until it isn't. The final act rushes through moments, as if they had a max limit on runtime. The slow creeping tension is gone, characters making unrealistic decisions which aren't explained through their character. Because we really don't know who these people are, AJ getting by far the most background. Even side characters have massive question marks left behind by the movie (why is there a single homeless man hiding out in the neighbourhood yet fully aware of what's going on). There's some commentary on police not believing female victims which just appears and disappears. The Mother becomes just another superhuman creature which chases everyone around. The real villain shows up (side note: his backstory scene is shot brilliantly) and then kills himself with no real explanation on why (if he can't reach his gun how's he been surviving down there). It just seems there was another third act that was 30/40mins longer that they threw out because then the movie would be too long. But The Empty Man proved that being too long isn't always a bad thing if there's still plot to explore.Overall, Cregger is definitely someone to watch. He shows a lot of promise, and I can't give this film a negative score because of how successful his ambitious moments are. If only he kept his ambition through to the final shot, and we'd be looking at a modern horror classic. Instead, we have another modern horror which can't escape the cliche ending curse..",2023-01-26
"So disappointing. Was looking forward to seeing this one and was so let down. From the unnecessary red hearings, to obvious reshoot/pick up sequences, where lighting, make up and acting don't match, to completely inadequate character choices and scene development - this film has everything it takes to disappoint even those who expect generic run of the mill mediocrity (tautology for emphasis).The best moments in the film are comedic ones and yet, this is not intended as comedy. Found myself asking questions, like how long does the main character's interview sequence need to be to not be brought up ever again and give me the information I already know? How much money did HBO pay for the licensing of this and more importantly - Why? Who read the script and decided to green light it?Filmmakers used to be there to educate the taste of the masses, now directors on par with executive producers simply make films for the dollar signs.",2022-12-11

"A double booked Airbnb, scary basement with an hidden tunnel & a mysterious creature. A perfect recipe for making a terrific horror film. Tess & Keith are the ones who have double booked an Airbnb. She is here for a job interview & is not happy about the situation she is in with the Airbnb. Keith however succeeds in convincing her to stay the night & to trust him. Her vulnerability at this situation is well established. Nevertheless, both Tess & Keith find themselves in the basement, investigating it, directly leading them to the inhabitant there. I have to admit, by now the film was already a total winner for me.Justin Long's AJ showing up as the owner of the building, pushes the story further. The character of AJ is actually well written as his personality is revealed perfectly. Justin Long needs to be signing more horror films. Coming to the movie, avoiding the spoilers, the narration is top notch. Zach Cregger impresses with his hold on the subject. There is not much time wasted as the story quickly gets into business. The reveal too happens on the right time while maintaining enough suspense & the cut aways are effectively done irrespective of the timeline.I do regret not watching this in the theater because I would have definitely had a blast watching it.",2022-10-30
"The first act was intriguing but once she came face to face with the horror element the film fell apart. I also could not understand why a nicely maintained and decorated house was in the middle of a derelict and abandoned area of the city. Who would have a place here and want to stay here? Absolutely daft. Also, it was never explained why the place was double booked. The flashback to the previous owner was almost interesting but not much was made of it. The initial discovery of the basement and its use was not explained. How did the people who decorated the place not spot the other areas this girl easily found?The useless Police were ridiculous. Of course they would investigate this place but oddly drove off while looking menacing. Stupid and an insult to the actual local police!The final act was even more ridiculous. Signposted outcome at every step. The daft fall off the water tower and catch was beyond realistic. Had high hopes for this but very disappointed.",2022-10-30
"I loved this movie! At first I thought it would be a cliche stranded stranger movie but it actually has a plot that unfolds which is rare these days!This idea seems fresh and new. It was exciting to watch the layers unfold. This is one of those movies where you can't duplicate the first viewing. I suggest going in blind and just enjoy the movie. For which I am proud that the trailer doesn't give you much of anything.The third act was a bit wonky, but I still enjoyed it. 10s across the board for the twist and turns done right! You have no idea where this movie is going so just buckle up and be entertained.",2022-10-19
"I came into this one knowing absolutely nothing about it, all I knew was that it was a new horror film with Bill Skarsgard in it and that was enough to peak my interest.I don't really know what to say about this film that won't give too much away because it really is one of those films that will be far more effective the less you know about it. But wow, all I'll say is that is starts off like most Blumhouse type generic horror movies and then about 40 minutes in, it just flips completely on its head and becomes a wild and absolutely bonkers thrill ride that will have you thinking about it long after the film has finished.I was literally on the edge of my seat throughout most of the 2nd act.I wouldn't really call it a horror film in the traditional sense, it's more of a white knuckle thriller with horror elements but it's expertly crafted to keep you engaged.The acting here is superb from all 3 of the main cast, Justin Long and Bill Skarsgard are always watchable and I'd never seen Georgina Campbell in anything before but she is superb in this.The effects are great for what they are and the use of sound in this film is some of the best I have witnessed, it's used to such effect that it almost becomes a character in itself.If you are a fan of taught, edge of your seat thrillers, then do yourself a favour, stop looking for reviews of this because you'll no doubt come across one that will spoil the film for you, go find a dark quiet corner in the cinema and watch this film how it's meant to be seen, you won't regret it, it's a hell of a ride.",2022-10-07
"The beginning is promising and quite interesting for this I can give it 1 star. Everything else is totally unrealistic full of nothing. The plot is ill-conceived. Actions are tiresome and unexciting. Like seriously you start watching this movie and you can compare it with chocolate frogs from Harry Potter, you expect it will be a cinnamon taste and u are given you know another 'brown taste'. In a middle of a movie we are presented with another story, which is not related to the main plot and it was the worse decision from the director. Not only it was unlinked in the end somehow it was completely slowing the movie and distracting viewers from the main plot.",2022-12-05
"This movie does nothing new. In fact it's a step back of the old ""devolved human"" theme.The setup is the least disturbing part of the film. It could have been the basis for a decent horror flick. But where it goes from there is just ridiculous.It could have been a mix between The Hills Have Eyes and Martyrs but it ended up being a mix between Austin Powers and the cellar lady from Evil Dead 2.So instead of feeling uneasy and also feeling sorry for the""creature"" I was just rolling my eyes at the Hulk like powers presented here.And regarding physics: if you are the Hulk and you push yourself off really hard you might catch up with another human falling from a skyscraper. But not at the height shown here.Ridiculous and disappointing.",2022-10-30
"This was an unexpected delight. I didn't expect a relatively low-budget horror movie to be this smart and leave me pondering its message after the credits rolled.Barbarian has a lot to say about abuse (thankfully without graphic scenes thereof) and the way abusers see themselves and rationalize their actions. It repeatedly subverts the audience's expectations in the process, and judging from the countless ""terrible ending"" criticisms it does so in ways for which many of us were wholly unprepared. It is just too easy to empathize with one of two actual monsters, who seemingly plays the role of a savior until he can't help but reoffend.",2022-11-02
"This movie isn't even close to what I was expecting. And that's a good thing! The first act is genuinely suspenseful, and I found myself clutching the edge of my chair several times. But then the movie goes completely nuts in the best way possible! Barbarian honestly surprised me with how funny it can be at times. There are some great gross out moments too.The less you know about this film going into it the better. I will say that it is great if you just want good, schlocky horror movie fun. But it is also good if you want to dig into deeper horror commentary themes and ideas.It may not be for everyone, but it's definitely one of the best horror movies I've seen this year!",2022-09-10
"Could've been OK if not for the characters being unreasonably stupid.Tess arrives at her Airbnb in the slums of Detroit and finds a man already there. Man #1. He explains that he rented the same place through a different service and the two of them agree to share the place. Weird situation, but they talk and soon enough she feels safe enough in his company. Using various means, the movie tries to bait the viewer into thinking that there's something wrong with the guy, and that he's eventually going to be our antagonist. Interesting enough so far. The next day they discover a deep, scary-looking dungeon in the basement. They enter said dungeon only to be assaulted by a gigantic, disgusting (meaning covered in dirt and naked) woman. Man #1 gets brutally murdered on the spot while Tess gets locked in a cage. It's all downhill from here.We then suddenly cut to a third character, the owner of the Airbnb house. Man #2. The dumbest of them all. Met with financial difficulties, he has decided to sell the house, and so he goes to Detroit to check on the property, presumably a couple of weeks after Tess checked in. He finds Tess's and Man #1's personal belongings still there. He calls around to find out if someone is currently renting the place, to which the answer is no. After hearing noises and finding more stuff he seems to conclude that there are squatters currently living in his house. This worrying situation obviously warrants an instant 911 call, but ""I'm a man"" he says out loud, proclaiming his intention to clear out the squatters himself. He arms himself with a small kitchen knife and proceeds downstairs to the basement where he discovers the hidden dungeon. Somehow he gets sidetracked thinking (out loud, again) about how the extra space means that the property is worth more. He gets out a measuring tape and proceeds to measure the dark, creepy looking dungeon without a care in the world, despite being convinced just a minute ago that there's someone living down there and that the situation called for bringing a weapon. Predictably, he gets assaulted by the same gigantic woman and gets locked in a cage with Tess. Stupid, useless men, amiritee???More uninteresting stuff happens and Tess escapes the house. While trying to get help for the useless Man #2 still stuck in the dungeon, she gets the attention of two cops (useless Man #3 and #4) in a patrol car and explains the situation. Since she's dirty from staying in a nasty dungeon for two weeks, the stupid man-cops think she's a crackhead and disregard her. Or actually, even worse, they listen to her, follow her to the house and THEN disregard her, instead of just entering said house or attempting to corroborate her story somehow. They had probable cause to enter the house times a gazillion. The cops leave, and instead of Tess trying again with different cops, she decides to take the matter into her own hands. Girl-boss mode activated.More dumb stuff happens. The guy who's still trapped in the dungeon gets his hands on a gun and yet he doesn't shoot the giant disgusting woman-monster despite having several opportunities. At one crucial point he even fumbles it and drops it on the ground like an idiot in some cartoon. Useless to the core, which I'm guessing is partly the point.Something I didn't mention: Man #2's financial difficulties stem from him being accused of rape and his subsequent legal fees. I won't get into too much speculation about what the messaging is supposed to be here and in general, but I think you get the point.There's tons more nonsense and spelling it all out would take longer than I have. In summation it's a bad movie with creative decisions that don't make much sense, except if they're really political decisions. Nowadays I try to ignore political messaging and enjoy the movie for what it is, but in this case that simply wasn't possible.The acting and cinematography is OK. The ending isn't great, but it's an ending. The movie is competent enough for a 5/10 by today's standards, but I'll never watch it again. Depending on your own standards and your tolerance for nonsense, I guess you could watch it and enjoy it somewhat.",2022-10-26
"Non-Spoiler: Seriously as this movie progressed i felt this was really insulting to females in general. As a dad of 3 daughters i cringed at the stupidity and poor judgment and happily my daughters cringed right with me. I would be a failure of a dad/human being if my daughters made 20% of the obvious wrong choices this girl did.(Spoilers Below)
The Good:
The whole premise... double booking a Airbnb that is creepy along with the ellaborate tunnels underneath the neighborhood created by a serial killer and that human-like mom creature descendant was really really cool (Score 10 right there)... And had they lightened up about 70% on the stupid human scooby doo factor the I would have raised my score up at least 2 notches.The Bad(Really bad could have all been fixed if they just laid off the full throttle on stupidity and played it differently.)
#1. Who on what planet pulls into that neighborhood and goes forward with an AirBnb. Answer (NO ONE)... Her car would be looted on blocks in 5 minutes. When the leading girl escapes there isn't a normal/safe looking house for miles around. Reinforcing the AirBnb would have been a no go for 95% of your average intellect. And a much wiser choice would be sleep over in the car at a truck stop with a shower.#2. After deciding to insanely pursue the AirBnb she decides to stay with a stranger because its been double booked... I mean of course right... Really really crappy unsafe neighborhood that no one would stay in... when when you get inside another stranger is occupying the place and a young female chooses to stay????#3. And her journey down to the basement is just relentlessly stacked with more extraordinary stupidity as to who in their right mind would still be there instead of shouting downtown in the police command center. And mind you this is after she's chased by a homeless person up to her door way.#5. Even an intellectually challenged person would have taken of one out of the dozen or so choices she reasonably had to shut the whole thing down and get to safety.(What would have made a 8+ for this movie).Easy:
1. Make the neighborhood nicer just a bit where the AirBnb was so it didn't make the girl seem stupid off the bat.2. Do more with the Airbnb rental agency to smooth over the other stranger being at the airbnb to establish a baseline of safety. Otherwise she looks stupid again blindly staying w a stranger in such a horrible neighborhood.*** Just #1 and #2 add 1 star alone...3. This area needs story alterations to change the circumstances of how/why she's in the basement in the first place. First off a normal person isn't going down in that basement in that neighborhood... Especially after she sees the neighborhood during the day and gets chased by a homeless person to the door. However, lets stretch and say she does... SHE'S NOT GOING TO FORGET HER CELL PHONE... and she's NOT going to walking back in dark tunnels behind secret doors on her own... And when she sees that torture room She's going to be off and running. If they could somehow tighten/rearrange the circumstances here on this 15 minutes of the movie i think it clicks up another notch...Lots of potential but this DOES NOT belong on any top 10 list by a mile.",2022-10-31
"I was so excited for this movie and the hype made me more hyped but man it was a huge disappointment. Don't understand the hype honestly. People have seen these kinds of movies before. It tries to pass off as a psychological horror up until the first act and even in the trailer it looks more like a psychological horror, mystery plus fantasy but boy it was the same old slasher movie without a knife packaged beautifully with different background stories of the characters. I think maybe that's why people are getting fooled. They are merely liking the characters and how the movie unfolds because it's interesting, anxiety -inducing and will keep you guessing till the first act. But the story itself isn't new. Also the characters looked like they had brains but only till the first act. After that they make the same stupid mistakes because plot convenience. The movie is lucky that it's fooling so many people because it gets other elements right besides the main thing, story. The atmosphere is great, it's intriguing, there is tension, guessing - game, cinematography is great, the acting is great etc. Etc. But sorry the main story the movie revolves around isn't new. I wouldn't have mind if it wasn't new if they offered something different here but nope. Also, there are some plot holes that I usually ignore but here plot holes take the sense away of this movie. Those first two characters you see should have been dead at the first night. You know why I'm saying this if you've watched the movie or you'll know why I said it when you watch it.",2022-10-28
"After quite a solid start with two charismatic characters in an awkward situation, the film takes a strange nosedive and completely loses its focus, its direction, and with those, all suspense and immersion are gone.It doesn't really matter that the performances are pretty good - it's a bit of a chore to get to the end of this mess of a film.And curiously, when I read that Jordan Peele was involved, it all made sense to me. This film had less budget than Peele's stinkers, and it has even less coherence, but it shows the same unfocussed naiveté. You can even tell which one of those brillant ideas are Peele's.Either way - there are some half-intense scenes and a bit of gore, but ultimately, you'll find no thrill in this one. And when you think of the director's statement that up in the house it's a Fincher movie while in the cellar it's a Raimi movie, you can only shake your head in disbelief, since the he doesn't seem to have seen any of those vastly superior directors' films.I'm afraid not even a few beers will make this worth your time.",2022-10-26
"This movie started as a very promising then it became interesting and the climax was: NOTHING
So you cannot know why the movie is called Barbarian
Or what's the story behind the old man and the creature instead of the silly story the homeless dude was telling
Or how the old man or the creature were feeding all these years since he is sick in bed and she doesn't go out in morning not to mention even at night she cannot go to the supermarket or anywhere actually!Lot of gaps
Lot of holes
Lots and lots of disappointments
Story was rich and definitely you can extract lot of horror from but the outcome was extremely poor and turned to be a real waste of time.It is a BAD movie.",2022-11-18
"I'm not a horror film fan as I think it's not done as well as in the 80/90's but when I saw the ratings and reviews for this movie I had to give this genre and movie another chance to impress me....why did I bother? This has got to be the worse movie I've seen in a while. Nothing makes sense. The characters don't make sense, the story line doesn't make sense, the ending doesn't make sense.... You can see where I'm going. I don't understand why the readers of IMDb has held this film so highly. Not a good movie I'm afraid but this is only my opinion.

"I heard this was a nifty little thriller. I also knew what it was, so i decided to remain in my seat no matter how stupid the action on screen was. Naturally, if i leave a film early, i don't review. Anyway, tess finds her pre booked b n b occupado by keith. He invites her in, natch and before you know it, she's asleep in the bedroom. I knew at some point we would be in the dark attic or the dreary basement. The basement it is. Very bad things happen. Then, quick as a wink, we seem to be in a different film. Not to worry tho. We're back on track soon enough. More bad things happen. Justin long, usually a nice guy, not so nice here. It's sometimes more unpleasant than scary. The acting and direction are passable. So is the movie. By the way, what's with the guy buying diapers and baby wipes. Wha happen? Tess is one tough cookie. Noto bene. One more thing. The word faggot is uttered. Who thinks that's ok. Not me. Shame on them.",2022-09-09
"I had read a few spoiler-free reviews that said it was ""slow"", ""boring"", ""not worth the watch"", ""utter sh&t""...and was hesitant to push play. I'm glad I did as WOW. Have to say this is one of the more solid films in the horror genre and very much worth a watch.On the flip side, I felt the cops were depicted horribly (but far too often that is how they handle things in real life - based solely on personal experiences and I understand others may have experienced differently and disagree here) and Justin's character felt like a rehash of his character from, ""Tusk""; but those are the only 2 issues I had with the movie.Everything else was perfect.The setup.The atmosphere.The quick jump back in time.The pacing.And the villain (the main one, anyway) of MOTHER was TERRIFYING.Definitely adding this to the rewatch during spooky season list.

"Every character does the weirdest and worst thing in every situation besides bill skarsgard. The decisions they all make would never be made by anybody else in the world. I know this happens a lot in scary movies, but this was the worst.The thing that sucks is this movie would have been great if they didn't do that. There could have been plausible scenarios that would have lead to the same situations. The fact that anybody read the script and didn't suggest making the changes blows my mind.The acting was pretty decent so I couldn't give it a one star. Everybody was solid especially bill skarsgard. Justin king was entertaining too.",2022-10-31

Georgina, Bill, Justin thank you for this scorching talent fest!! A+ Horror!!!!",2022-09-11
"It's rare to find true excellence in modern day horror films. While there are great movies being made in the genre in recent years, they have unfortunately become a rarity over the past decade. Through the teens and into the early twenties, there are only a few examples of truly excellent horror films, as the likes of Get Out or Hereditary are very few and far between. Barbarian is a flawed, uneven, but nevertheless excellent horror film that soared near these heights in the first act, showed a lot of potential, but fell just shy of achieving a place in the annals of true genre greatness. That being said, it's certainly worth a watch and will not disappoint viewers seeking a campy, fun and scary flick.Spoilers herein - the first act follows our heroine Tess as she arrives at her AirBNB only to find it occupied by fellow renter Keith, who seems only too gentlemanly to be genuine. He accommodates her by insisting she should stay in the house, presenting a scenario that should leave most viewers, especially women, feeling uneasy and cautious. Tess describes herself as ""tough"" and goes on to prove it many times throughout the film. Contemporary social issues are used effectively in this part of the movie to help solidify the uneasy tone; the dynamic of a woman forced to put her trust in a man she doesn't know, the horrific decay of the Detroit suburbs, and the undertones of misogyny are all present in this first act, which ends with Keith and Tess being captured by a very strong, violent, but ambiguous monster.The tone changes gears quickly in the second act, providing some relief to the audience after a fairly bloody and intense scene. Here we are introduced to AJ, an actor who's douchebaggery becomes quite obvious within a few minutes while he is unceremoniously fired from his new job. We learn through a series of expositionary dialogues that, unlike Keith, he is a misogynistic jerk who has crossed a line with a coworker. After AJ arrives at the Detroit house he tends to provide some decent comic relief. When AJ ends up caught by the monster as well, Tess takes the opportunity to go for help.The third act sees Tess return to save AJ, who in turn double crosses her to save his own butt. The monster ends up becoming somewhat sympathetic as we learn it's motives, which takes away some of its ferocity - one of the key flaws of the story. The ending lacks the visceral punch the audience is salivating for after such a compelling start to the movie. That being said, if you're looking to relax and enjoy a twisted horror film that devolves into a campy creature feature by the third act, Barbarian is a good choice and highly recommended.",2023-10-17
"I had high hopes for this movie but it did disappoint. I've given it 6 out of 10 because its still better than most horror movies, but it's not a gem or anything.The movie is in 3-4 segments. The first is the best. Good tension, a prevailing sense of unease, some really horrifying propositions. It's one of those - no don't do that!! Kind of movies.The second section was about a grubby tv star and was less enjoyable. I wasn't even interested enough in him to see him get his come tuppence. So what. He made the whole section irritating.The third section was some pre-history. Wasn't scary.In the fourth section, one character has told another that the old dear in the house is not the worst thing in it. So, I start waiting for this worse thing to appear. Turns out to be a weak old man dying in a bed. Oooh. Yes, he was a serial killer/rapist but he's not scary anymore. Disappointment. Movie plays out to the end which is just really sad. Really really sad. I mean, genuinely evoking sadness.I don't know who needs to hear this but, old people aren't scary. They just aren't. Neither are saggy boobs, or falling out teeth or a few wrinkles. If an old person starts coming at me, I'm going to be pretty happy they're old. Not that I'm sure the woman was old - maybe she was only forty or so. But you know, that whole concept, the old sad mother thing, was zero scary. It just made me feel sad. For her. I have seen way too many movies lately where I'm meant to be terrified by the spectacle of some skinny old person filling doorways or hallways. Sometimes this is done effectively but quite often I'm just waiting for the scary bit to begin. Do people really find skinny old people that terrifying? They're just old people.",2023-01-07
"'Barbarian' is both a straightforward thriller/horror, but also a bit unique and unconventional. The set-up is simple - Tess (Campbell) is staying at an AirBnB in Detroit, which happens to be double-booked by Keith (Skarsgard). Seems straightforward what might happen next... AJ (Long) comes along as the landlord and there's a few flashbacks of Frank (Drake). Other than that, a very light on cast, carried by each of the stars.Even though it's a horror film, the tone is often light, but allows for tension to be built, mostly thanks to the good score. I did like the turn it took after the first act. Always good to see Justin Long in a horror film - this is up there with one of my favourites, 'Drag Me To Hell', and is better than 'Jeepers Creepers' and 'Tusk'.It's fun and fast - only 100min - and Campbell does a convincing job of being empathetic and not the stereotypical victim. See it to find out what happens! Great directorial debut from Cregger.",2022-11-20
"The characters of the movie have to be a bit dumb, we expect that, especially with characters of Horror Films.In this case, the main character makes several dumb and unrealistic choices on the first 30 minutes... So at that point you have to ask yourself what kind of horror fan are you?Are you the type to scream at the screen 'Dont go in there, turn and run.' and laugh and enjoy the idiocy when they inevitably go in there?Or are you the type to roll your eyes and tut and complain when the characters go in to a place that no one in their right mind would go in to?I feel the former type will enjoy this movie whilst the latter type will find it clichéd and ridiculous.I enjoyed it.",2022-12-18

Never been one to use an airbnb but I promise you this, if I show up at a rental and someone is already occupying that place, rest assured I will be turning back around and going home and will not be agreeing to share that space with a perfect stranger. By and large this film was meh, having absolutely nothing to write home about. So these hype reviews are simply misleading and will never change a meh film no matter how many you read.

"I was really looking forward to see this movie and i like the horror genre.I expected something different ( i mean if youve read the reviews you would think that this film has something new to offer)But this movie only gives you the horror everyone knows and the characters are ALL stupid. Way too stupid.The monster looks like every other monster
And i cant overlook the stupidty of the actors.. its like they have to be THAT dumb so the story can exist, but then the story is trash too. (felt like ive seen/heard the story in about 100 horrorfilms before)And i wasnt scared for one second because you can see everything coming and as i said the stupidity from the actors is way too much to get a scary feeling. You can tell what will happen next and thats exactly the thing ive read many times: you cant expect what will happen next but that is just wrong. You can easily guess what will happen from the first second on. It has a lil turn in the middle but this will end up to be the same trash like before.I have to give this movie a 1/10 because i cant understand the high ratings. I would probably give it a 3/10 but this current rating is way too high for this film and sets wrong expectations
I didnt expected it to be the best horror movie ever but neither expected i that the story would be that dumb and predictable.And the ending was too much for me.. after all the dumb decisions that have been made the dumbest one is that the guy is dropping his gun by mistake (like in every movie before), like wtf you cant be serious with this trash.Or that the police just leaves her there, she obviously is no homeless crackheadFor me, it really was the worst horror movie ive watched in 2023.",2022-12-30

It's unbelievable how many positive reviews there is for this movie, makes you think how they got there and how I can get on the pay roll. The positive reviews almost give you a false sense of hope that the move will turn out okay or even semi-worth your time but you will likely find yourself skipping forward near the end just to get the movie over with.

"Everything was just on the edge of believable the whole
time. The tension early in the movie was fantastic, but things are just a bit too haphazard.A couple of things that I have to point out though, really spoiled this movie for me.Why didn't the first guy, Oscar I think it was, notice anything was amiss at first? Also if the creature comes out at night why hadn't it attacked them then? What even happened to his body (the first guy)? How long was she down there for? Why did no one at all come looking for her? Didn't anyone know where she was, she seemed like she had herself together enough to let people know. I also really didn't buy that the rental agency, or literally anyone would ever realize the goings on down there. What the hell did any of them eat down there? Why didn't she use her car, and the other guys car, as evidence for the police? Why didn't she try to get herself arrested so she could at least have a chance to prove her point, and especially to get away from the mother creature?This movie is let down by sloppy writing really, and I don't think it would've cost the film anything to explain things better. The timeline didn't have to be so stretched out which would've made the whole thing more believable.Some might critique the charectar/ tonal shifts but these were obviously a choice and they were really well executed.This film is great, enjoyable through and through, but it's kinda sloppy upon reflection in a way that ultimately spoils what could've been a really perfect horror film.",2023-02-15
"Barbarian starts off with one of the best opening acts i have scene in a horror movie in such a long time. The hints and nudges about what we are going to see along with the atmosphere and awkward silly dialog provides a great juxtaposition. Too bad it's all shown in the movie's trailing.Starting on the second act, the movie feels like it tripped in production and start going down hill. Shoving a #metoo storyline down our throats to setup a thoroughly dislikable character is boring and a decade too late to be relevant. He honestly feels like he's only her to force the slightly less annoying MC to stick around for the plot. Along with another political train wreck sniping at police in such an unbelievable setup that breaks anything left at immersion, we head towards the final act of nonsense.The reveal of the true horror going on here, a serial kidnapper and rapist taking women to his hidden tunnels, falls completely flat as the monster is just a geriatric man who quickly dies. This took what waz horrible terrifying aspect as we never knew for sure and put words on it, making it easier to separate. Combining it with our monster being a multi-generation incest baby removes anything close to scary at this point. Then you have a scene where Long throws the MC off a water tower and ypu can't not ask: ""what the f is this movie?""The soundtrack is really well done, but the sound mixing for theater release is horrible: going from silent to piercing hurts. This could have been so much more and I wonder where it went on the tracks or this is what it was meant to be.",2022-09-11
"This movie does well setting a creepy atmosphere with a bit of mystery in the first half and then keeping you on the edge of your seat in the second half. The story is decently written but isn't a masterpiece. It uses a premise that's been done before and adds to it in it's own unique way.That said, the main character got on my nerves because of how stupid she is at times. She makes a few downright dumb, cliche horror movie mistakes that causes her to be in her situation. The movie falls into other horror movie tropes as well, which are mild complaints on my part. The bigger issue I have is, it never explains who it was that drew the first 2 characters there in the first place and how does the person on the phone in the beginning relate to anything? Maybe it will explain in a future sequel.All in all, I agree with most people's ratings on this movie. Its not a bad movie. I think most horror movie fans will like it.",2022-10-29
"The only Barbarians are the professional movie critics of this film who tricked us into thinking this was going to be good. First half started out strong, the vibes and music was great. You might as well turn it off once Justin long shows up. Not due to his acting, he did a great job. The story just takes dumb turns, to his unnecessary character as a whole to the super powered swamp thing lady and let's not forget the serial killer/ rapist. If I wanted to see serial killer rapist I would watch Unsolved Mysteries. So many questions about things that should be obvious to the characters. Does no one call the cops when they see an obvious rape dungeon in your Airbnb... No bust out the tape measure to get that extra square footage listed on your property lol. Cops actively trying to disbelieve her , come on. She waited till the cops left to break the window when that's all she had to do while they were there to chase her inside down to the basement. Homeless man sees swamp thing every night but decides it's still safe to stay there. "" Been here 12 years she never bother me"" then... you know. Property management doesn't say, ""hey by the way, our cleaning staff keeps finding drops of milk and poopy foot prints all over the house that leads to the basement "". Honestly the only good part is the beginning when your trying to figure out if Keith is good or bad, falls apart after that. But...

"I'm an avid fan of horror and also, I truly do appreciate movies with deeper messages and social commentary. However, I do not like when the movie solely relies on its message to justify its greatness. For me it's the art of storytelling, character development, cohesion of the story, great pacing with only relevant details (Chekhov's gun) that make the story great.Many details in this movie are not necessary or are not explored. For example, some guy Marcus calls Tess in the beginning of the movie. Who is that? It's never explained. Why was that needed? She goes to the interview on her first day in Detroit, and we meet the interviewer. Why are we wasting time watching it? The interview and the interviewer are so unimportant to the movie's plot. These are unnecessary details. And there are so many more. My biggest disappointment with the movie is that the movie dedicates less than 5 minutes to the main villain's backstory, and I would like to know at least a little more about him.All in all, this movie feels incomplete. It ends abruptly without all the needed explanations and without an earned payoff. It felt as if the movie ended at a climax and didn't have any falling action. The subplots that needed exploration got less than 5 minutes meanwhile those unnecessary ""character"" development subplots for the sake of the ""deep"" message of the movie, that are later thrown out of the window, got too much screen time.I really hope they don't make a prequel explaining everything that was left unexplained.",2022-09-12
"Really well done horror movies are EXTREMELY hard to find. I had high hopes for this movie as it was said to be really good. It had a rating of 7.1 (as of this writing) which usually means it is quite watchable, maybe even enjoyable.Well boy was I was mistaken. It is not a good movie but I did watch it, because once it switched gears and stopped misleading the viewer, I couldn't look away due to disgust and disbelief.Not only was the final plot of the story totally silly but the characters made stupid and unbelievable decisions. I dislike movies where the characters make blatantly stupid choices. I also dislike movies in which completely implausible things happen, for example (spoiler below.....look away now......)Spoiler: The girl and the mother (technically wasn't she the old creepy's guy's daughter? I didn't care enough to figure it out) fell off the tower. The girl falls first, yet lands ON TOP of the mother - how does that happen?) Both survive the fall. Like really..... I can suspend belief for movies that are well made with decent plots... but things like this were just the icing on the cake of a bad movie that I really wanted to be good. In the end, I'm just disappointed that I still have not found a current horror movie that is actually good.",2022-11-14
"Barbarian is a strikingly disturbing but full of message-like misogyny that takes away from its initial intention which is to scare you. Leaves you mentally incapacitated by analyzing any film's plot to realize that none of the films makes a damn bit of sense.I will start with the elephant man in the room. It spends time, actually multiple times complaining about men and how men are horrible. But in reality, it finally turns the page to show the truth that men and women are not equal and will never be equal. The film goes the latter route, showcasing that we are different and the difference is solely that one gender is primarily good and the other is always bad. All men in this movie are immoral or idiots or you know bad. VERY LIGHT SPOILER IN THIS SENTENCE AHEAD. The cop is bad because he won't listen to her, the actor who owns the house is bad, the guy renting the Airbnb is a coward, and the guy who owned the house before the current guy is a monster. A line from the film: ""The world's different for you. Guys get to blast their way through life making messes. Girls have to be more careful."" And this is just one of the many idiotic lines of gender misinformation pushed by super-radical people. It's sad because it shows you hypocritical things even in its activist approach. Especially when the guy in the film has kindness and says he will sleep on the couch while the girl can have the bed. Chivalry at its finest, he calls it his upbringing, but in actuality, if we were equal why would she get the bed and he would get the couch? Shouldn't it just be the normal conversation of flipping the coin, why bring your upbringing into it if women shouldn't be treated differently than a man? The film has trouble with its ideologies and keeping one gender down by trying to showcase we aren't different when we are and should be treated differently but only when it's in the favor of the women.As for it being scary, a few jump scares, and a few claustrophobic moments but it's too damn dumb. The story has so many inconsistencies how the subject of the film could go around unnoticed is beyond me. But it's a horror film and its angle was to not be analyzed because if it was you would realize that none of the story and I mean none of it, none of it makes a damn bit of sense. Every house is evicted and falling apart. One house is in the middle of the street and is in perfect condition, completely clean yard, bright and wonderful. The subject prowls around at night unnoticed by the general public, by any cops, by any gangs, by anyone but one homeless dude. No one breaks into the only house immaculate and intact in the entire neighborhood? A gang with you know weapons hasn't blasted the subject in the film with 400 rounds of lead in Detroit's most dangerous neighborhood. The house that this horror is taking place in, all of the people that rented it before. All of them must have made it out alive because when the guy who owns the AirBNB asked his management staff about the premise they said people were there a few weeks ago. So people placing reservations have records on the Airbnb app and yet they didn't notice the subject in the house? But they all survived, but it just seemed to attack this time and no one talked about it when they rented the Airbnb before. My head hurts thinking logically about any part of the film. It's dumb and made for a dumb audience. It's shot brilliantly though, with amazing camera angles and a wonderful atmosphere but beyond mentally idiotic and in cognitive decline.",2022-12-04
"Finally a movie that dares to go it's own way and does not care one bit about following conventions. It is a very entertaining ride and one you will not forget to that. The director has a idea and follows that to the extremest point, going all out and throwing in the most absurd ideas as he goes along. But that is what makes the movie fun and entertaining to watch. Just when you think you figure it out another curvball is thrown in. In these times when horror movie plots can be easily figured out the director has fun being one step ahead of us.The overall result is absurd, weird, bloody but also scary and surprisingly fun with a big dose of black humour. But underneath all that the are serious topics it deals with and asks us: Who really is the barbarian, the monster? Just take it for what it is and go on a wild ride!",2022-10-28
"I honestly can't believe that some people actually like this movie. And also, some people think this movie is scary? LOL. I'm really surprised how many people have zero taste. I won't recommend this movie to anyone, not even to my worst enemy. If you really hate yourself and want to lose one hour and forty minutes, then you should watch this movie. And your friends who recommend you this movie? They're not your true friends.Zach Cregger you're dumb. And you made the worst movie ever. I'm just soo much disappointed.PLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE EVER. PLEASE. JUST DON'T WATCH IT. IT'S SO STUPID.",2023-01-26
"I loved the satirical moments and I appreciated the suspense in the first half of the film. The reveal of the main antagonist weirded me out a little, it certainly wasn't where I was expecting the movie to go. I also think they should have expanded a little more on the storyline of Frank and his daughter because it was interesting but we only got vague descriptions and hints about it. The actung was good, except some scenes with AJ. I think with better acting the scene at the club of him confessing to his friend and the scene where he decided to throw Tess would have stood out a lot more if the actor focused on them more and gave a better interpretation. If you like horror I suggest you watch this, it's enjoyable, but it's not like it will blow your mind or anything.",2023-07-05
"Finally, we have a horror movie whose trailer didn't spoil the whole movie for it with Barbarian and man am I thankful for that fact.On that note let me start off by talking about the story of this movie and how well done it is. As I mentioned earlier the trailer for this movie keeps everything in this movie very vague so even if you watch it you have no clue what you're in for. The story for this movie takes you on a wild ride that leaves you guessing what exactly is going to happen next and wondering where exactly this story is going. Keeping things spoiler-free this movie story is broken up into three different parts and honestly, each one of them has its strengths and weaknesses that will for sure divide everybody who sees this movie. The first act's strengths is the tension that it starts to build up and feels like an actual horror movie while its weakness is the pacing of it as due to building up that tension requires time and it does move at a slower speed. The second act's story's strength is the same thing as its weakness, which is that this one feels much more like a drama than a horror movie. Due to this it kind of feels out of place with the rest of the movie and probably should've been changed for the final film product. It's also here where there are some ""comedic"" bits that some people might find funny but I didn't. I won't go fully into the strengths and weaknesses as I firmly believe you need to see it to believe it as this act is the most insane part of the movie. I will say that the story for this movie is definitely not for everybody and will 100% leave you feeling uncomfortable but somehow still wanting to keep watching.Another element of this movie that will make you want to keep watching the movie is the acting in this movie. The acting in this film is very limited down to it being really only three actors and all of them are spectacular in this movie. Starting off with Georgina Campbell who plays the main character could easily just be another smart final girl but no she makes sure Tess stands out among the others. She plays Tess in such a down-to-earth way that the audience could easily relate to her, especially since she makes decisions that a majority of people would also make. That's not to say she always makes the right choices but she still makes a decent number of them compared to some other final girls. Next, you have Bill Skarsgård, who plays Keith, and man does he steal the show in my opinion. Right off the bat, you have no clue if this guy is good or not and keeps you guessing. This is what makes his performance so captivating to watch as you the audience member feel like Tess at that moment wondering if is he going to murder her or just a socially awkward guy. It's also that social awkwardness that some audience members might be able to cringe and think that they're like that as well. Finally wrapping up the cast is Justin Long, who plays AJ, and he was very much a close contender for being the best performance in this movie. You can easily tell that Justin Long just had so much fun with this role with how well he played his character. He definitely was the comedic relief in this movie but the writer of this movie knew when to give him more comedic lines and when to pull them back. There's one scene in this movie that best shows this with how it starts off all funny but quickly turns more serious. Which is exactly what Justin Long did with this role. He knew exactly when to be comedic and when to be scared for his life. It's funny to watch him act beside Georgina Campbell and see the two different ways people would act in that situation with their performances. There aren't really any side characters in this movie to talk about their performances but without fully giving away too much I will mention Richard Brake's performance in this movie as it was really chilling to watch.For me personally, the best part of this movie is the cinematography. The cinematography for this movie helps create tension in this movie and helps the audience members feel like they're in this situation along with the characters. The lighting in this movie is all-natural which really is effective in a movie like this. The opening scene of this movie best shows how lighting can be used to manipulate viewers' expectations and question what exactly they see by showing one shot in complete darkness and the next in bright lighting. The all-natural lighting best comes into play for this movie when the characters are down in the sub-basement part of the house which is in cased in complete darkness. The audience can't see what's in front or to the side of the halls creating that feeling of uneasiness of not knowing. It's due to the darkness that a couple of good scares happen in this movie. Now, will these scares have you jumping out of your seat? No, they most likely won't unless you're easily scared but, and take this from someone who isn't easily scared by movies, the scares in this movie most likely will have your heart skip a beat. Another reason the scares work for this movie is due to the directing in this movie done by Zach Cregger. I looked him up and noticed that most of the projects he's worked on have been comedies but based on this movie I couldn't tell. His directing for this movie fits perfectly with this kind of movie with both the comedic parts and the horror parts to it. He knows how to make the audience feel like they're stuck in this situation and have them hoping the characters in this movie make it out alive. The last thing I'll mention for this movie is the score in this movie done by Anna Drubich which was spectacular. The score wasn't used for every scene in the movie and was only used when it was really needed and it really helped build that tension for those scenes it was included in. In the end, Barbarian is definitely not going to be for everybody but for those who think they can handle what happens in this movie definitely give this one a watch.",2022-09-11

"Sadism, Misandry, Nihilism... When is this nightmare of an era gonna end?A movie typical of it's time... sadly... again.This is like merry-go-round going around and around in a never ending descent to the bottomless pit. Only horror movie I really liked in 2022 is ""Deadstream"", and maybe ""Glorious"" and ""Black Phone"". But ""Deadstream"" is the opposite of hyped, because hype has turned to this fast-food, consumable, addictive, sickening, sadomasochistic, propagandistic, chaos-worshipping sewer leakage, that somehow gets called ""m o v i e s"". This has to be the ""Sodom and Gomorrah"" of movie eras.I am so angry, I saw another piece of junk of a movie, that spoiled my soul.",2022-11-12
The beginning of the movie start off great. A realistic idea of a double booking of a Airbnb And all the things that would scare you does. The person your could be staying might be a murder yet your not sure and then you get this creep vibe of the house your staying in. What immediately turn me off and confused was the second act. It felt like the second act was rushed and not throughly thought out. Adding a new character who is obnoxious and annoying meant nothing. Also the ending movie left me empty. Had this movie expanded on the terror of double booking of Airbnb this movie would have been good.,2022-11-08
"I was recommended 'The Barbarian' by someone who found the story refreshing and said there was some feminist ideas at play. I'm not a big horror fan, but I was intrigued. He didn't wanna say much else and spoil things. I kept the same attitude.Tess (Georgina Campbell) takes a trip to Detroit for a job interview and books an Airbnb. When she gets there it's a renter's worst nightmare. The key isn't in the lockbox, she can't reach the person responsible for the ad and it's a rough looking neighborhood on a cold rainy night. Then it turns out the place has been double booked and Keith (Bill Skarsgard) is already staying there. They find a compromise and she gets comfortable with him, but when Tess finds something creepy about the house the real story begins. Intertwined is AJ (Justin Long) an LA actor who owns the property. He comes to town to sell it off because he needs money to fight a legal battle.The initial setup was super effective. It did a great job of creating tension, suspense. The acting is solid. The characters feel real. Tapping into fears about strangers or if you want to take it a step further as hinted by the film - the trope that all men are possible serial killers and/or potential rapists. 30 minutes in the real horror element strikes.The ultimate issue is suspension of disbelief. 'The Barbarian' asks a lot of you. You can excuse it to a certain degree because horror films always have this element. It never stops being creepy, but good will earned by an original opening settles for a predictable landscape and cliche city later. The feminist ideals are shallow but come with a pro female payoff. Certainly not an awful film, but not the level of quality I hoped for neither.",2023-10-09
"Horror films. There are so many tropes and cliche at this point in the genre it's very difficult to create an unique experience.Barbarian succeeds in this by continuously surprising the audience. There are very little expositions and the film does an excellent job of ""show, not tell"". The dialogue is also spot on and characters are consistent in who they are and how their personality and values decide their behaviours. Some parts are legitimately funny which really adds to the enjoyment of the film as a whole.This is a film I recommend to everyone because I had such a thrilling ride with it. This was a brilliant rabbit hole to climb into if you are feeling for an interesting horror film.",2022-09-18
"First half is decent, good characters, actors and story and as soon as the 2nd part starts it goes all south and gets worse every minute. Pretty disappointed I watched it till the end, I should have stopped after the car song which was the only good of part 2 at ~45min. The rest is just ridiculous and a lot of nonsense, there were so many illogical things I have rarely seen in a movie and the plot is like its from someone else than the first part. Its like 2 students got some generic topic from their teacher to write something about, lets say a spooky house/neighbourhood without knowing what the other one is going to write. The first knows what he/she is doing (I rate it 8), the other is pretty lousy
(a 2 with good will) but in the end they just have to put their stories together. So my advice do youreself a favor and leave it after the song!",2023-02-19
"First part was good. Felt like I was being set up for a really good episode of the Twilight Zone. I had no idea what to expect and there were so many twists and turns I almost got lost in the maze myself. Plenty of plot holes throughout, but I honestly didn't seem to mind - thrilled that I was actually being entertained.The second part turned everything upside down as it morphed from a horror into a comedy and #MeToo advertisement. Don't get me wrong, it was funny, just unexpected. Plus, it really didn't seem to fit to be truthful.The final part combined all three and ended in a way, unlike the entire rest of the movie, that was predictable. It definitely has all the earmarks of becoming a cult classic.Above Average (6 out of 10).",2022-10-28
"I saw the trailer for this scary movie only a few days before its release, it looked like a straight-forward ""curiosity killed the cat"" concept, so I went to see it on Halloween. Basically, Tess Marshall (Georgina Campbell) has booked herself into an Airbnb in Brightmoor, Detroit. Arriving at the place in the middle of the night, she finds it has been double-booked and is already occupied by Keith Toshko (Bill Skarsgård). Tess is initially unnerved by Keith, but she warms to him as they get to know each other. She explains she in the area for a job interview, and he allows her to stay the night; he allows her to take the bed while he sleeps on the sofa. The next morning, Keith has left for the day, and she goes to her interview. It is only in the daylight that Tess realises that the house is in a rundown neighbourhood. After returning from a seemingly good job interview, Tess is chased inside by a homeless man (Jaymes Butler) yelling that she must leave. Alone in the house, looking for toilet paper, Tess ventures downstairs into the basement and gets locked in. She stumbles upon a hidden corridor behind a door and is shocked to find a room containing a camcorder, a stained mattress, and a bloody handprint. Tess runs back and is still locked in, but Keith arrives and helps her to get out through the window. Tess tells Keith what she has seen, and he goes into the basement to investigate. When he does not return, Tess returns downstairs and discovers a door that leads to a subterranean tunnel, where she hears Keith screaming for help. Entering the tunnel, she finds various cages, and an injured Keith. Moments later, they are attacked by a deformed naked woman (Matthew Patrick Davis), who brutally kills Keith. Sometime later, AJ Gilbride (Justin Long) is a sitcom actor who is driving and feeling good, until he receives a phone call that he has been fired from his television series due to allegations of rape made by a co-star. Pressured to sell his assets to pay for legal costs, AJ travels to a rental property he owns in Detroit, the same house rented by Tess and Keith. AJ inspects the house and finds the evidence of people recently staying and going down into the basement he eventually discovers the hidden door he was unaware of. He enters and finds the corridor, and goes down into the underground area, where he is attacked by the deformed woman. AJ wakes in a pit alongside Tess, who explains that the woman, referred to as ""the Mother"", wants them to act as her children. When AJ refuses to drink milk from a bottle offered by the Mother, she drags him away and forces him to breastfeed. Tess manages to climb out of the pit and escapes the house by breaking a basement window. She eventually reaches a gas station where she calls the police, but the officers are dismissive of her story. She convinces them to go back to the house with her but refuse to investigate the house before being called away, assuming that Tess has been using drugs. There is a flashback to the 1980s which shows Frank (Richard Brake), the original owner of the house, who abducted women and held them captive in the tunnel. The hidden room with the bed and camcorder were used to videotape himself raping them, then rape the subsequent children. Back in the present, AJ discovers an elderly and frail Frank living further in the tunnel. He initially assumes Frank is another victim of the Mother, and assures him that the police will come to investigate. Frank quietly grabs a hidden gun, while AJ discovers the videotapes and watches one of Frank's rapes. Frank momentarily aims the gun at AJ, before turning it on himself and firing to commit suicide. AJ flees with the gun while the Mother leaves the house to find Tess. The Mother is seemingly killed when Tess runs her down in a car. Tess returns to the basement to rescue AJ, but he accidentally shoots her. She survives the gunshot, and they escape together, and Andre, the homeless man from earlier, offers them shelter. Andre explains that the Mother is a product of multigenerational incest by Frank, and he assures them that he has been safe in his location for a long time. Suddenly, the Mother ambushes the group and kills Andre before chasing Tess and AJ up a water tower. AJ pushes Tess off the tower in an attempt to save himself, and the Mother jumps after Tess, shielding her from the fall. As AJ attempts to rationalise his actions to Tess, the Mother wakes up and kills him. The Mother tries to comfort Tess and wants to take her back to the house, but she reluctantly shoots and kills the Mother. The sun rises as she stumbles away. Also starring Kurt Braunohler as Doug, Sophie Sörensen as Bonnie, J. R. Esposito as Jeff, Kate Nichols as Catherine, Kate Bosworth as Melisa, writer and director as Zach Cregger as Everett, and Cregger's wife Sara Paxton as Nursing Video Narration. Campbell is pretty good as the main protagonist put through hell, Long is alright as the owner of the house also becoming a victim, and Skarsgård is interesting as the (at first) creepy but good fellow renter that goes through the nightmare. I will be honest, it started the way I thought it was going to go, then it shifted gear going to another character, then the flashback explanation of what was going on was a little off kilter. I'm assuming the title refers to the character Frank, being barbaric (savagely cruel). It is certainly not a predictable scary movie, it has a couple of cliches you may expect, but with the monstrous naked woman and the moments of violence, it keeps you on your toes just enough, I will admit I was hoping to be more thrilled, but it's not a bad horror. Worth watching!",2022-11-12
"The first half of the film had me genuinely scared. I lost that feeling when they revealed the monster. If they had stuck with the plot line of the first section of the movie it would've been a 10/10.I'm not a fan of creature scares and I was intrigued by a film that seemed to have a human antagonist. The unease I felt stemmed from the main character being a woman alone with a strange man in an unfamiliar house at night. This was realistic and as a woman, I understood Tess' actions.I enjoyed not knowing (like Tess) whether the man was malicious or not. That added to the sense of fear. However, once his true nature was revealed (along with the monster) the film transformed into people vs the creature. It lost its roots in reality, making it less scary.",2022-10-08
"I honestly expected more from this film, the atmosphere is quite tense and the film manages to make you uncomfortable and scare without having to resort to jumpscare, but to be honest I found the script to be complete garbage, without the slightest coherence, to begin with because tess and the keith rented the same house at the same time, what's the explanation for that? The owner of the house did not know about the existence of the basement? After all, in the movie he seems to visit detroit often, he even has friends there, what was the method that the crazy guy used back in the 80s to capture women? Who was that homeless person who knew about everything that was going on in the house and only warned tess when she was in danger and why didn't he tell keith about what was going on in the house? Or the owner of the house? Anyway, I'm not saying that everything had to be meticulously explained because that would be to underestimate the intelligence of those who are watching, but where's the analogy between the facts?",2023-01-01
"Rating: 6.9
Overall, a fun, suspenseful watch that builds story pretty well and does many elements of horror right as you go farther into the conflict, but is pretty bare-bones when it comes to filmmaking, acting, and writing.Pretty Good Direction (Able to get the storytelling across very nicely as he builds the narrative driven by suspense; also able to get the most out of his actors and elicit fear (at least in the horror parts, the non-horror parts were pretty bland and amateur)), Pretty Good Acting (Pretty Good to Good from Georgina Campbell (Was able to hold her own very well being the lead character as her fear and anxiety builds throughout the movie the farther into the house she goes), Pretty Good from Bill Skarsgård (Works off of Campbell very well and helps build some of the suspense himself with his mannerisms), Pretty Good from Justin Long (Plays the aging/fading actor very well as he pulls from his experience), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Decent to Pretty Good Story (While the overall concept and layout is pretty cliche and simplistic, the storytelling is good and a lot of the elements play well together to drive the story forward; the ending is a bit questionable though), Decent to Pretty Good Screenplay (The dialogue in the non-horror parts was a bit bland/simplistic, but there were many symbols and elements of horror that were spread throughout the movie that makes it very suspenseful and capture the audience's attention), Pretty Good Score, Very Good Cinematography (The different angles used throughout the movie are very good in helping build suspense and helping build the world/house that is very eerie), Good Sound, Good Editing, Pretty Bad Visual Effects (Really shows how low budget the movie is as the visual effects really make the movie tacky and less scary), Pretty Bad Makeup (Really tacky and really takes away with the movie being realistic at how bad it is), Plot Structure was pretty well laid out as it introduces the conflict very well and then builds it back up right after a switch in scenery (with the climax and end being very well defined), Pacing was good (not too slow or fast and the runtime was about right), Build to climax was very typical of horror movies but does a decent job at building suspense and keeping the audience engaged; climax was good and suspenseful (but the ending is a bit questionable and really takes away from the movie being scary), Tone was typical to that of many suspenseful horror movies (and the movie does a good job at building this)",2023-06-13
"Firstly, this is the most overrated movie i have ever seen, it's so overrated to the point that i started to think that maybe there is sth wrong with me, there is sth that i didn't get that everyone else got from watching the movie.And god knows i wanted this movie so bad to be good, coz i really liked the trailer coz it creeps you out without giving any indication on what's really happening in the movie, but the movie wasn't that good at all, it's so stupid, illogical and the story, as well as the scenario, doesn't make any sense at all, I don't really get the hype, and with all fairness, it doesn't deserve more than a 4 for me.",2022-11-02
"I do not know exactly how many of you will be in agreement but I didn't like Justin Long's part in the script, not a single bit! It was going all so well in the first half, with an engrossing Script and some convincing performances, especially from Bill Skarsgård, I was drawn right into the middle of it.However, when the mid-point hits, right there happens a significant tonal transition so comes along Justin Long with his unwanted presence. Perhaps, I am alone on this one but I despised his inclusion, so much so that his unwarranted, out-of-the-blue appearance put me out of the great experience that I was having earlier.The film still finishes on a strong note, thanks to Georgina Campbell's commendable act as well as the tidy staging of the horror aspects but that whole sub-plot of sexual misconduct, and narcissism pertaining to Long's character leaves a sour taste in my mouth. I wish that whole part was chopped off.Anyway, Happy Halloween, May the spirits, witches, and goblins grant all your wishes!",2022-10-31
"While it was very well made, the story wanders and there's even an abrupt scene for a while of a completely different character that seems irrelevant to the rest of the movie. The character is some repairman driving around and visiting neighbors. I don't know what he had anything to do with the rest of the movie. The Barbarian itself is not entirely explained either, but looks cool. The story needs a rewrite and there's no way of understanding how the inside of the house is impossible to include the dungeons and dark hallways and gates which was way too over the top underneath the basement for such small space before entering downstairs.",2022-09-02
"It does! I think this is the second review I write on here. I don't usually write reviews, but now I'm peeved over spending an otherwise perfectly good Friday night watching this movie, all because of all the hype around it. How could anyone possibly enjoy watching something this stupid?For starters, Airbnb has perfectly good customer service, had the protagonist turned to them the moment she realized there was someone else in the house, this movie would have been over in less than five minutes. But no, she just had to spend the night in the creepy house, in a creepy neighborhood, with a lame jumpscare here and there and even that single piano key that suggests that you should be scared. After that the movie keeps getting increasingly stupid, with one stupid decision after the other.I get it, many horror movies wouldn't exist if it wasn't for the stupid choices their characters make, but this is too much and it's a pity, because with this kind of background story they could have actually made something really scary and disturbing, but through it all I was just too distracted by the stupidity of the characters to feel scared.I watched it till the end because I was at least hoping to get a better picture of the background story. When eventually the explanation I was waiting for came, the scene just turned hilariously ridiculous real quick, making it impossible to even care about what happened next.I wasted my time, hopefully you won't waste yours.",2023-01-06
"I'm going to guess that one day the most unpredictable thing that a movie could do would be to do the predictable thing that everyone was expecting? Which brings me to the newest ""horror sensation,"" this year's 'Barbarian.' Although most of those claims seem to be from social media posts posted by the studio that released the film. 'Barbarian' doesn't even have that many twists and turns really. There's some pretty clever misdirection early on but sudden changes in the narration seem to be what people are singling out.The whole story focuses around a single house in an area of Detroit so decimated that it resembles a war zone. How this house would ever get rented in the age of internet reviews is truely the greatest mystery in 'Barbarian.' But get rented it does as Tess (Georgina Campbell) knocks on the door of said house that she has reserved only to be greeted by Keith, played by Bill Skarsgard. He invites her in so they can sort out the mix-up. It's this first part of the story that is the most interesting and well acted, setting the stage for a solid thriller until everybody goes to the creepy basement and the story settles into a standard horror movie formula.But, before that happens, we get the perspective change to a television director (Justin Long) who has been credibly accused of sexual assualt and has lost his job. He owns the house in the war zone and goes there for reasons? There is no record of anyone renting the property, so while snooping around stumbles into the same terrifying secret. It's at this point where the movie descends into jump scares in dark hallways. It's also the least interesting of the ""vignettes"" on display. Justin Long is supposed to playing an an unpleasant character but he is so unlikable that I would guess that some of that is from who he is as a person.Then we get a flashback to the person who created the terrifying secret to begin with. 'Barbarian' jumps around, shifting characters and time periods before the story ends up back in the basement to set up the conclusion. It's here that the movie somewhat gives up on building tension and goes into full schlock territory. Unlike 'The Neon Demon,' 'Audition' or 'Malignant' which head into gloriously shocking territory during the third act, 'Barbarian' gets pretty silly. This includes characters climbing to the top of a tall building and other various story cliches that deflate some of the creepy elements the movie had going for it.That's the thing about 'Barbarian,' it's doesn't really push any boundaries and delivers few memorable moments. The filmmakers do rely on more than jump scares and there are some nice practical effects but it fails to really impact the viewer or leave much of an impression. It's a well made, entertaining entry into the horror genre and I would say to check it out if you're into those middle of the road scares. Just don't expect any nightmares. 6.5/10.",2022-12-26
"I feel like the writers had a 10 minute screenplay for three separate movies, then decided they could fit them all together to make one film. It was bad. You could piece it together but it was all a stretch. All the interesting parts of the story weren't shown or elaborated on.Very disappointed with the whole thing. It felt like a horror show confused if it was jump scares, gore, psychological triller. But just did all of them half assed and without any real effort. Maybe 2 real just scares (unless you scare REALLY easy)
Also as a side note the weird, gross fetishization of brest feeding was out of left field.",2022-11-01
"Overall barbarian is an enjoyable movie, especially if you go in fresh! Not knowing what was coming next was great, especially when the set up isnt exactly what you expect, then the 2nd act comes in and it confuses you again!I really liked the opening with the casting of Bill Skarsgard (from the IT movies) as the person in the house, which immediately puts you on tension as he's known for having the villain role. That makes every shot in the start filled with tension...whether its a coffee cup or just a sentence uttered from his word. The movie makes you think it's one thing, then goes in a totally different direction while keeping you engaged.The second act was also quite amusing, changing to the actor, making it a slight comedy for some time. But it's great how they eventually weave that story as well into the overall narrative. I wish there was more explanation as to how the woman was freakishly strong...but it's more of a nitpick than anything.The last act is standard chase action more or less, nothing particularly to write about here. The killing of the monster felt...incomplete for some reason? However did not take away from the overall enjoyment of the film.Overall it was super enjoyable, super tense, the mystery keeps you engaged, with some scares, but doesn't stick the landing as much as I would have liked. Would recommend to watch though!",2022-10-03
"This movie is freaking great!, it pretty much has everything, good actors, original storyline, well directed, well written, awesome cinematography, epic score, a little twist here and there, plenty of suspense, even more creepiness with some more creepiness to top that off, all with just the right touch of comedy. It even has a small, really predictable part, which must have been done purposley to pay homage to old horror movies but the rest of the movie does keep you guessing which is just awesome to see. Yes this movie falls into the horror genre but its so much more than that. Its really inspiring to see masterpieces like this still being made. This is a modern day cult classic for sure.",2022-11-03
"As a seasoned horror fan, I started watching Barbarian expecting a bland nostalgia fueled horror movie (for the director, as I'm not exactly a fan of the kind of movies certain horror directors swear by). But instead, I was pleasantly surprised by everything I saw.As many reviews say, it is better to go in blind, but I can assure you that it is far from your run-of-the-mill horror.I personally appreciated Barbarian's smart and socially relevant plot, how the cinematography reflects the characters' point of view in a clever way, and the director being very careful about what to show and what to suggest instead.On a more personal note, I'm also always happy to see a black girl as the main character of a horror movie, even if it's more common nowadays.So, if you think you know the plot of this movie, no you don't. And if you are a woman really unsure about whether to give this movie a try, do it, you might be pleasantly surprised.",2022-11-01
"I normally go to the movies to catch up on sleep and get away from my narcissistic girlfriend. But this one actually kept me awake and the 'creature' had many of the same traits as my girlfriend. It almost had a Tarantino-ey feel to it (in his early days). Not sure if it's worth going to the movie theatre to watch (unless you too have an annoying family and need to spend a couple of hours in darkness), otherwise wait for one of the streaming services to show it. I will certainly think twice before booking my next air bnb...although I wouldn't mind being double booked with a hottie like Georgina Campbell...",2022-10-27
"First part is very nicely done and had me hooked from the very first minutes. Interesting filming, great acting with rational realistic thinking (which is refreshing) nice atmospheric eerie feel and attention to details.Then comes the second part. I thought I would give it a chance as the first part didn't seem to leave room for disappointment.Well, not only was there disappointment but they somehow achieved to ruin the entire movie. Seemed like there were two different directors that had complete different views of where they wanted to go with this.All in all, this second part felt rushed, unbalanced and uninspired. Went from 9/10 to 4/10.",2022-10-30
"The first 30 min is enjoyable as you start getting a sense of fear. Once you see what that scary creature actually looks like, you quickly learn that this it's just a Halloween TV special for teenagers. This movie is medicore at best and I assure you that after you watch this film, you will never want to watch it again. It's almost like those creatures from The Hills Have Eyes migrated to Detroit and settled in a low income area. This movie, quickly turns into a joke and you start wondering who the producers paid off to have this movie receive such positive reviews when in fact this movie is a mashup of all the bad 90's horror films.",2023-05-05
This film was really good and scary early on . Tess (Georgina Campbell) moves onto ab. Air b and b which just happens to be double booked with Keith (Bill Skarsgard) staying there too . Soon weird things happen when Tess sees her locked door open up and Keith is making noises in his sleep . They both soon investigate what is going on . It is never followed up why the place was double booked after the initial confusion .Tess is interviewed by a lady for a job who tell her she shouldn't be living there. The lady doesn't say why not . Soon AJ) Justin Long ) moves in too .The film is a bit similar to Wrong Turn re the villain . It has it's moments but becomes a mishmash of different films .There is one character who appears in the film whose part seems totally irrelevant .,2022-10-21
"By any means, this is not a very good movie. I can hardly recommend it. But it still stands above the mediocrity that is so widely spread these days. Standards just suck nowadays.It is well made. It surprises. There are twists. Acting is good. Tension is uneven and what is not uncommon these days, it's mostly prevalent in the scenes that are NOT horror related. I don't know, these guys have no imagination to create proper horror but deliver in other aspects. Which is cool, but this is still a horror movie, so? My BP rose in a ""confused cops scene"" but was flat in the underground. Go figure. Also (which is sadly common, too), once the ""reveal"" is revealed - bang, the terror is gone. This tells us how difficult it is to make a proper horror movie. The art feels gone.So, this is a ten - a recommended, but a far cry from what really constitutes a very good horror.",2022-10-28
"It was a pretty cool start and Bill (Keith) & Georgina (Tess) are great together. The thriller bits definitely get you in the beginning, I even liked how disorientating the switch was when we're introduced to Justin's character (AJ) but it does start to go off the rails...When I think back to the bits intended to scare in the beginning, none of that is really explained. And the timeline of the origins doesn't feel right. It's as if they came up with a ""monster"" and then threw in a few points and hoped no one would think too much about it.Lots of twists that I didn't see coming so it kept me interested though. Overall I enjoyed it, but the ""monster"" element and story around that aspect didn't work for me.",2023-02-13
"The first half was great but then it takes a very strange turn. I'm not going to spoil anything, but the film needed to have a better reason for what the killer was doing. I really didn't get it.The part where she finds the room is brilliant, truly horrifying in the best way possible. But sadly, it was somehow forgettable. I wish I had more positive things to say about it. I really wanted to love it. I had no expectations going in. I had no clue what it was about either.The main characters and acting were great though. If they could fix the motive for the witch lady, I would have easily given this a higher rating.",2022-11-28
"Another hour and change, I will not get back. This movie was like a bunch of cliché horror scripts run through an AI. The only clever thing was having Skarsgard (Pennywise) and Richard Brake (from a bunch of better horror flicks) in the cast. The characters were paper-thin and ran through every stupid move in the horror movie playbook. The only person worth rooting for was the homeless man who tried to help, and the two idiotic Millennials killed him. The acting and some of the shots were not bad, but the script was just thin. The rave reviews over this movie versus the lameness are not on the legendary level of the Blair Witch Project hype. Still, I am glad I caught this on streaming and did not go to a theater.",2023-07-12
"This was a total waste of time. It was not scary, not entertaining, not remotely believable or engaging, and definitely not worth watching. Scary things happening in a basement has been done to death. This movie adds nothing to the genre. The supposedly shocking surprises are ridiculous contrived nonsense. I found nothing to like about this movie. Even if you've seen every other horror movie that's ever been made, don't waste your time on this one. I'd gladly go back and watch something I've seen before and enjoyed instead of trying to enjoy this useless movie. I cannot believe it gets positive reviews.",2022-10-30
"The plot of the movie was really interesting and very mysterious. The storyline was well-written and totally unexpected. The filming location of the movie was nice, just a small house in a creepy town. The characters were very interesting, kinda well-developed and some of them were really likeable. Gladly, the trailer of the movie was very well edited and there weren't any spoilers on the trailer. Of course, it was an unpredictable movie and totally unexpected, the plot twist was totally shocking. Also, it was a really scary movie and there were too many jumpscares. In my opinion, the first part of the movie (first 40 minutes) was amazingly well-developed and totally shocking. The casting was really good and the acting was nice. The killcount of the movie was just fine, even though only one kill was really bloody. Moreover, it was a really intense movie from start to finish. The ending scene was kinda unexpected and kinda emotional. Last but not least, I hope they're gonna make a prequel, because we need to know more things about the movie. Overall, it was a nice movie, very scary and unexpected.",2022-11-08
"Arriving at a remote house, a couple of strangers find that they've been accidentally booked to stay at the house through separate AirBnB services and spend the night together, but the more time they spend at the house reveals a dark and demented owner living there with them that puts their lives in danger.Overall, this was a fairly solid and enjoyable genre outing. One of the better attributes of this one is the surprisingly endearing setup that provides a genuinely unnerving starting point for a premise like this. The general concept of the double-booked home where they both inadvertently arrive at the same time unaware of their other's intentions to stay there through their reservations is a wholly worthwhile idea that has a modern flavor and feeling to it. That it takes an idea that's very plausible and can actually happen starts this off rather nicely while also making for a generally fun time as they get to spend time together at the house despite all the signs signaling they should leave, both from the state of the community around them as well as the testimonial of others around that knows the area far better. This all creates a workable setup while also generating the kind of likable starting point so that the creepiness slowly starts to work in on worthwhile characters. Once the creepiness does start to come about, the film shifts into high gear rather nicely with the secrets of the house coming into play rather nicely. As we're already unnerved from the initial setup and the initial discovery of just the strange room in the basement, the gradual reveal of what's going on in the house with the strange being in the basement living behind secret walls and hidden underground corridors is quite chilling for the most part. Once the full extent of her psychotic intentions is given, the demented antics present here add a rather dark edge to what's going on that plays a big part in what's going on throughout the last half that utilizes this information for context of how the chases carry on in the house and the final confrontation at the abandoned factory which plays into that setup quite heavily. Combined with the stellar makeup on the main villain and a few solid gore effects, these manage to provide a lot to really like about this one. There are a few minor issues to be had with this one. One of the biggest issues with this one is the inclusion of the secondary subplot involving the exploits of the actor being brought up on misconduct charges that arrives at the house out of the blue which is entirely problematic. The whole idea of the character feeling incredibly topical and ripped from the headlines is a bit too on the nose, but with a tenuous connection to what's going on and just being suddenly dropped into the storyline out of nowhere with little explanation during a point in the secondary storyline that was really building a lot of interest is the wrong call entirely with this one. As well, there's also a problem with the constant and utterly infuriating move-set by the characters who are frequently placed in harm's way through rampant stupidity on their part more than anything else, routinely walking into areas unarmed or trusting the situation to resolve itself rather than keeping themselves alive which is quite disheartening and holds this one down.Rated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence, and Nudity.",2022-12-27
"I don't understand the love-fest for this film. I saw it in the theater last night, and I hated it and I'm a horror fan. It was poorly written, made no sense, and it was random and nihilistic. Maybe that was the point. There were also a lot of loose ends that could have made the film better if pursued, and it doesn't hold up under very much analysis. My girlfriend poked holes in it all the way home.Unexpected does not mean random, but I think whoever wrote it wasn't able to create a sense of surprise in any other way. Like someone else said, it was 90 minutes of WTF. Sorry, but that just isn't good horror.",2022-09-21
"Greetings From The Basement-
There was a time where I got legitimately scared watching movies. I mean there has been plenty over the last 40 years that left an indelible mark on my brain. The Shining and The Brady Bunch Movie come to mind.This movie? I saw the hype on this site...and my goodness the first half was pretty OK (Mr. Myagi). At the second act, unfortunately fails to bring it home for me...
The movie was humming along just fine until the director took it in an entirely different direction. It's like the director drove the movie into a tree at high speed.If this movie was locked in a basement and started to scream, would anyone hear it?",2022-11-13
They obvisly wanted to make a horror tarantino movie.But without logical actions from the charackters or without explaining why the creature is so powerfull (the only thing what makes it survive and 'scary' spoiler i mean surviving a large fall ?) Its just dumb to accept the movies story as a viewer.What about getting the heck out of there is and notify the press and put some pressure on the policemen that didnt want to help.

"Two strangers Tess (Georgina Campbell) and Keith (Bill Skarsgard) book the same rental house in a very deprived part of Detroit, he is already there but when Tess turns up late at night she agrees to stay. Down in the basement she makes a very grim discovery. I have to say that on the whole I have a low opinion of modern/21st Century horror, yes there is plenty of it but the majority is mediocre at best. Thankfully Barbarian is one of those few movies that stands head and shoulders above the crud. It comes with a fairly small cast but all of the characters were enjoyable, needless to say Skarsgard gives yet another superb performance, great actor. Without calling the plot completely original it is highly inventive and engaging, at times very tense and creepy but there is also a fair amount of very welcome humour too. Yes, some of the characters (Tess in particular) does make some very dumb decisions and the ending is pretty hard to swallow but I really enjoyed watching Barbarian, a great big screen directional debut from Zach Cregger, I look forward to seeing what he does next.",2023-01-07
"I am starting to totally lose faith in modern horror movies at this point. Once again a complete and utter failure in every single aspect of ""horror"" while continuing the trend of every other modern horror in absolutely saturating the film in current social commentary and conditioning.Below average on; cast, camera work, screenplay, editing, sets, design, sound & music (if you can call weird wailing sounds that). Weak characters and poor dialogue with, most importantly, NO HORROR.Not only does this film fall flat in technical terms & creativity but it also feels the need to preach to you it's social politics message constantly. Please stop injecting this into every film.Disappointing 3/10.",2022-10-28
"Damn this movie makes no sense. The first half is really good, the dynamic between two main characters is quite good and interesting. I think it goes downfall when Justin Long appears, his character makes no sense.Like why would Tess keep going in and out of the house to help people she doesn't even know. Why would the police ignore her like that lol. She walks with a shot wound like it's nothing and gets thrown away from the top of that tower and still survives wtf. Although she flew like 1 km away from the tower and landed on top of the woman, who jumped after her lol. Who would go into an airbnb like that without checking the area, and who even put the place online in the first place.I guess this is just in case they want to do a sequel but still, it could have been good, sad.",2022-09-27
"Arm yourself with patience cause this one is a late Bloomer. Attention to details is excellent but at the expense of a bit slower tempo. This is definitely not your everyday horror movie and the idea is quite good and original, also the acting crew is very good. Some parts were really dragged out while others too quick, especially towards the ending of the movie. Of course good horror movies don't come that often these days and this one is definitely a fresh breeze in the industry. It is well worth your watch, but be advised you will not be that much scared but more pleased with the story itself, acting and generally the way it is filmed and camera shot.",2022-10-26

"Barbarian is absolutely bonkers to say the least. It was
all over the place. You think it's one kind of movie, and then it turns into a completely different kind of movie. The tonal shift that comes with the big twist is almost disorienting. I get the impression that the people behind this movie wanted to play with us. I can just hear them saying, ""Let's make a movie with a crazy twist that will have people scratching their heads, and then we'll get a good laugh as we make things get pretty uncomfortable for them."" There is a definite sense of humor present. In the end, the movie evolves into a dark comedy.Personally, I enjoyed the pre-twist section of this movie the most. I love Bill Skarsgård and we can't help but cautiously like his character here. I was completely invested in finding out where things were going with this character. Then things take a wild turn that's impossible to see coming. While Barbarian is crazy enough to entertain, it's also very much over the top in many places. Forget realism. There isn't a single intelligent choice made by the characters of this story. But the wild story kind of requires dumb characters. Whether or not you like this movie depends a lot on your sense of humor.I'm usually not a big fan of movies that stop taking themselves seriously after getting us to take it seriously (e.g. Iron Man 3). But there are a couple of solid scares, a good amount of suspense, and some creative editing and camera work to see here. Though it has some good moments, I was left unsatisfied.",2022-10-27
"The certainty that ""Barbarian"" has a sharp script only becomes clearer as the film plays with expectations and narrative structure, and Cregger conducts this fleetingly and amusingly, subverting the tropes of the genre with increasingly choices and breaks. Absurd. But let's see that, despite the plot depending on the suspension of disbelief to see its allegories, the dialogues are always provoking reflections and exposing who the characters are. However, in this dance, which takes the viewer to unexpected places and sensations, a mystery never ceases to bother: what is the neighborhood of Brightmoor? Away from the nocturnal darkness of the beginning, we noticed that the house addressed as Barbary 476 is the only one in the neighborhood that is in perfect condition; the painting, the finish, different from the precarious shape and apparent abandonment of the location. Having this conception relates to the accurate conversation between Tess and Keith about the roles that men play socially, compared to women. Let's note how, from the cautious, independent personality who was putting an end to a toxic relationship, Tess loses these convictions as terror enters the scene and she starts to put herself in dangerous situations in an attempt to help the men who arise. On the way. The first, Keith, is an unknown who became another turning point in the script. Although the arrival of AJ (Justin Long) represents what is most abominable and terrible in masculinity, an example of men who commit atrocities and seek to get away with it.The film's triumph is that it is truly unpredictable, with a steady stream of twists and turns that paint a scenario far more intriguing, frightening, and absurd than the initial one. The film wants to keep the viewer hooked, and it is impossible not to be seduced by the progression of insanity that it presents to ensure that the audience does not even blink. Zach Cregger does a lot with little. His creation borders on minimalism, starting from a mundane situation, using very few sets and a lean group of excellent actors. The few faces that appear are captivating, whether through the charisma of Bill Skarsgard's Keith, the wit of Georgina Campbell's Tess, or their total detachment from reality, like the terrible AJ. Played by the excellent Justin Long (Drag Me to Hell, Hungry Eyes), the character appears by surprise to steal the show with humor and regrettable decisions that only a horrible and petty person could make.The director's talent is also responsible for Barbarian being so fascinating. Cregger combines mastery of tension and silence with an inventiveness that recalls the early works of Sam Raimi (Evil Dead), conveying claustrophobia and acid humor by playing with tight frames, suggestive empty spaces or cameras mounted on the characters, to follow the action of close. In addition to the great direction, Zach Cregger also wrote the script, and shines with a plot that extracts horror from chance, escalating a small uncomfortable situation into a true nightmare with the confidence of a Stephen King story. As in the stories of the master of terror, nothing is what it seems - but true fear arises precisely in distorting the mundane. The filmmaker, who has not had a very interesting career until now, is already established as one of the names that deserve attention in upcoming projects, especially if he decides to dedicate himself to horror, perhaps following in the footsteps of Jordan Peele, another comedy actor who ventured into terror and today he is responsible for excellent works such as ""Corra!"" it is us"".Agile in its narrative, when the spectator is already immersed in the suggested claustrophobic terror, everything changes to a ""new story"". The format of ""Barbarian"" is that of an almost anthology, with three distinct characters having their own movements observed until the bonds come together in a web of absolute horror. If it weren't for the scattering of the second story, which takes longer than it should to place its character in the right place, in an unnecessary break in rhythm, the film could be very close to a perfect score. It also loses marks in its controversial ending, given an absurdity that happens at the end of the last act, in an improbability that hurts the real fear seen until then.It is only in the third example that the isolated neighborhood is understood, with the house being a representation of how patriarchy and misogyny can be normalized - which justifies how only residence 476 is the only one preserved in a decadent place, given all the terror experienced by women over the years - and the neighborhood is an example of how violence is treated in precarious locations, and at this point the focus of the film is to highlight the difficulty women have in reporting and being heard. When playing with so many elements, what ends up favoring the rhythm breaks is Cregger's contact with comedy, which he inserts in the way the editing goes against expectations and brief touches of acid humor. ""Barbarian"" benefits from this proposed reflection by presenting several trunks of a sexist tree that surround the protagonist, justifying her fear in her first contact with Keith. She herself has an abuser in her past, but she will also encounter other discomforts such as the police officers who dismiss her complaint or that boy who committed a ""granted rape"", as he believes. With all this baggage of unpleasant messages and situations, which give it adequate depth, the film is functional due to the goosebumps that arise from the dark environments and the performance of Georgina Campbell, who carries all the emotional load of a woman who is a survivor of multiple nightmares and who is still willing to help even those who wouldn't help her.The male figures of ""Barbarian"" are the real monsters. But to say so is to ignore the structure cited above. Why? Because even though it is fiction, men like these exist, and they are not ""monsters"", but men of flesh and blood, real, human and terrible. While exploring the house, the only one that is still intact, Tess discovers an entrance in the basement, which leads to corridors and more corridors. Obscure passages inside a clean and beautiful building. The elements used are suggestive: a camera in a tiny, dirty room, walls with blood marks, cages. The image of people held captive does not take long to form in our imagination. And we want that discomfort to end soon, for Tess to go up, turn around and leave. But that's not what happens. In an attempt to report what she saw; she tells Keith but her opinion is questioned. He needs to see it with his own eyes to believe that woman's word. And it's at that moment that, going down through the door again, because Keith didn't believe her, we find ""something"". Something grotesque, violent and scary. If the suspenseful atmosphere and the various elements located in the basement of the house were not enough, it is at this point that Barbarian establishes itself as a horror film. But it is thanks to the use of this new being that the film may, or may not, establish itself as a good horror film.The most superficial layer of the film indicates that the monster woman (or, just, ""The Mother"") of the house is not the real monster. In fact, it would be men. She, the result of multiple incest over generations, is strong and visibly aggressive. But the man who caused this to him, the owner of the house and responsible for raping and kidnapping girls, trapping them in the basement, is fragile and weak. The parallels between the victim as angry and the aggressor as innocent, misunderstood, are very interesting. However, this is lost a little in the last minutes of the film, in the attempt to create a moving plot twist. The choice not to present explicit violence against women is very good, especially considering that the director (Zach Cregger) is a man. In terror, the trivialization of violence against minorities is still a problem. In the case of Barbarian, all the violence is concentrated in the figure of the woman in the basement. She is also responsible for representing the ""foreign body"", a common element of this genre. She is grotesque. But in the end, she isn't. Just visually. It works well, but it simplifies issues like compulsory motherhood and repulsion towards female bodies. Tess is the only character who does not die. She crawls when the credits start and the song is ""Be My Baby."" There couldn't be a better choice. The image of the woman in the basement, who was not a monster after all, remains embedded in our minds. The cruelty of the stories intertwines and gives shape to a truly painful picture of our society. But it's the image of Tess, crying and walking, that allows for some spark of hope. Although she killed the woman who saved her, she ends the history of the house once and for all. She is a survivor among so many others who have passed away.""Barbarian"" is a scary and entertaining film due to its clayey narrative, however, it would be interesting to see more development beyond the agile way in which its concepts are conveyed. The result is a skillful tale of horror, which stands out for its execution amidst so many absurdities. An undeniable success is Drubich's unsettling score and Zach Kuperstein's suffocating and claustrophobic cinematography, who demonstrates an immersive and functional talent every time he seeks to convey terror with skillful framing and movement.Obviously, there is a lack of a certain precision in tying the story and an acuity to talk about a topic that goes beyond the limitations of never-having-lived or only-hearing-talking, mainly because it goes beyond complex limits when it touches on the points of its conclusion, but We won't even go into that merit. Speaking of creative ability, as a work of tension, there is a lot here. Even though it's nothing that will redefine the genre - and it doesn't even propose to do so - the film is a beautiful surprise.",2023-09-08
"OK how do I get back my 1h48 watching the movie?Seriously....the story isn't worth anything. In the first act you've got plenty tips but they go nowhere in the second act.Then, every ""scary"" scene was predictable at 100%. I was even playing a game when watching to tell what was going to happen.... I won for everything.Didn't they get anything with the horror movies from the last 6 decades?For example, a young single woman is getting locked in the sellar the first time, she discover a bed with blood and a recorder....seriously...I don't know you but for the blue eyes of a perfect stranger I wouldn't go back there.Then the guy see the same thing and decide to go further beneath??? What the hell is going on in their minds?She finally escape and ruin her only way to escape the town once more.She goes back to safe an idiot and got shooted by him with as excuse ""sorry but I'm a good guy""... Sorry, not a single person with some brains woild have done 10% from their decisions unless they got forced. Here, no one was forced. Maybe thay's the point....The way filming too. As example, when outside the house, filming in circle gives inly nausea. Nothing else (see Star Teek Discovery too for that...berk).Excepts Bill Skarsgard performances who were really good, the rest isn't worth watching it.Pass your way, there's nothing interesting to watch here....",2022-10-31
"From the double booked Air B&B, to the run down and abandoned suburbs of Detroit, and the serial rapist-murderer flashback starring the criminally underutilized Richard Brake, this film could've gone in so many different directions.I was hooked for about the first half of the movie. I really liked the tone and the setting. Georgina Campbell was good throughout. There was good chemistry between the two initial lead actors but the wheels came off once Bill Skarsgard's character was killed off. Bringing in Justin Long and going that angle kind of felt like unnecessary filler.Ultimately the double booked Air B&B (which is a cool concept for a modern-day thriller) didn't matter in the slightest. The motherhood theme was okay but didnt really fit any traits or themes of any other character or anything else in the film for that matter. All in all, nothing really meshed in the end. It's just a shame that there was a cool initial concept that ultimately culminated in a pretty run-of-the-mill monster horror movie. Real shame.",2022-10-31
"Maybe if I were ten I would have been scared. The acting was good, Director got lost in overproduction. So many times during the movie I thought 'the atmosphere and sound were outstanding' then the payoff and I'd see how that might be frightening but it wasn't frightening for me.Story was interesting and I suppose the acting was sufficient since I didn't start checking the clock till way after midway mark. Once the plot began its final unfolding I was Left with consistently more questions than realizations.I believe this was touted as one of the most frightening movies ever. I am no where near agreeing with that. Perhaps I shouldn't have watched what was the most nerve wracking movie I've seen in forever. 'Fall'. That blew my mind. This didn't. I'll give it another go.Watched again. It was tolerable yet I realized I missed nothing and was left unsatisfied.",2022-10-27
"The idea was incredibly dumb, with characters that were even dumber. Acting and directing was pretty good, but the monster was absolutely laughable. And the scene with cops was so stupidly unrealistic as to pull me right out of the movie. End sequence, insulting. Also, why isn't the woke mob after this for putting down incest victims?We expect characters in horror films to make stupid decisions, but the characters in this film make other horror characters look smart! Opening act was fairly well done, up until the point Bill decided to investigate the basement, and she followed him when he didn't come back...",2022-10-26
"Barbarian takes the old fear of someone hiding in your house and ramps it up to 11. The terrifying nature of the first act and the slow build to the reveal creates a chilling experience. Just when things are getting good, the film makes a baffling decision to bring in a completely new character and being their story somewhere else. I think the flashbacks hurt this film and do very little to help the story. Combining both male leads into 1 character would've given us more reason to care about the flashbacks and solidified a bond between him and the female lead. By introducing Justin Long, it takes away any connection we previously created and puts a sequel in the middle of the first film. Still producing some fear in the later half, the constant thoughtless decisions cause you to yell at the TV with unexplained horror movie tropes being shoehorned in to progress the plot. With a strong start and a not so strong ending, this was a mixed bag of a film.",2023-10-18
"First off lets get the acting out of the way, amazing performances from everyone in this movie, Justin Long was a huge standout as always. Barbarian starts off as more of a creepy and tense film than a horror, but around 30-40 minutes in does a complete 180 and goes bat s**t insane, and I was there for it. Barbarian takes you on a wild ride that has twist and turns as it goes on, and you get more and more of the full picture and the overall backstory to wtf is actually happening. I highly recommend Barbarian as it is extremely interesting and very well shot and masterfully acted by everyone one in it. Barbarian has quickly become one of the most disturbing and scary horror movies that I have seen in a long time, its a must-watch especially for horror fans. (IMHO)",2023-11-01
"So, like other reviews have said, I agree that the first half had real promise. I thought that the story was good and atmospheric and I was excited to see where it was as going to go. The slow burn between Tess and Keith's respective characters was interesting for me to watch, and I felt as though the plot was almost willing for us to believe that Keith was the villain.It seemed almost certain that the characters would go down into the basement for some unknown reason, and this is, of course, a very well-used trope in the horror genre. I struggle to believe that Keith really would have gone so far down having seen Tess so scared and panicked about her what she had just seen herself- and this is where the movie took a nose dive for me.The plot stopped making sense after Keith's untimely demise, and it was almost as though I was watching two different films that had been badly threaded together. For me, I feel as though ""The Mother"" needed further explanation. It would have benefitted the story if we could have learned why she ended up the way that she did, and why her father had also decided to live in the basement with her. I don't understand why she decided to kill Keith immediately, but decided to spare Tess and AJ? There are just so so many things that aren't explained, and a lot of largely unexplored themes and plot devices that are introduced but never delved deeper into.",2022-10-30
"A horror film release from earlier this year. When an expectant job hopeful comes into the Detroit area, Georgina Campbell (who I remember from the short lived Krypton series & an episode of Black Mirror), finds her airbnb housing occupied already by another. It's a dark rainy night & w/o many options to her, the occupant, Bill Skarsgard (Pennywise from the It series) invites her stay the night giving Campbell the bed while he stays on the couch. Reluctantly Campbell stays w/Skargard bending over backwards to prove he's a good guy so as she heads to her job interview, she's on a cloud of good vibes air as it seems to have gone good but when she returns back to her temporary home a noise coming from the basement leads to her investigate where she find a long hidden passage & a room w/a bare disturbing mattress which freaks her the 'f' out & as Skargard comes back into the picture, they both check out the horrors only for one of them to meet a grisly end as we introduce the owner of the home on the West Coast, played by perennial butthole, Justin Long, as he's ensconced in a sexual harassment accusation which forces him out of town w/his financial tail between his legs to his hopefully last place of solitude only to be dropped into a den of horrors. Making the most of another great concept, the rental from hell, this film scores a lot of 'what the f' moments but after a while seeing a particular gender being put through a grinder seems to be too comfortably de rigueur for writer/director Zach Gregger but if you can forgive the occasional dips into that old trope well, you'll be pleasantly disturbed...at least for the night.",2022-11-13
"There is no way anyone thought this movie was good. Definitely has potential in the beginning then the middle and end were literally terrible. This movie could have been way better. Like seriously. There could have been a bunch of those things the dad could have had bigger part, show more of how it all started with the dad like my gosh the budget must have been low because wtf. That's all I have to say wtf was that does no director know how to make a good scary movie anymore. The ending don't even get me started the worst!!!! Really wth is all I have to say the movie had so much potential!!!!!",2022-09-23

no story.. no background and then it jumps to another guy, having his career going to the trash because of an accusation..
and then of course, the house is the same one where pennywise got his head smashed..the whole story didnt make any sense.. it was i guess the story that pretty much similar to coweb.. someone hidden... evil.. trying to kill everybody.. why?Well, because she is evil.., do you need more?Since we dont have any background.. we dont know much about any of them.. so we dont care much if they live or die.. specially after being dumb and going into a cave inside the basement...",2023-09-26
"""You make a copy of a copy of a copy and you get her."" Great line summing up the dark and monstrous things that went on in the featured house leading up to the events depicted in the film.Back when the neighborhood of Brightmore Detroit (a real location) was a manicured suburb of a then bustling big city, beneath the polished exterior of one home there were cellars below basements with other layers of rooms\cells and cages under. In them, abducted women were tortured, raped, made pregnant, and then murdered after giving birth. Any female children were subsequently raped and made pregnant and done away wit as well. This went on for decades till the neighborhood surrounding the house fell into total decay. Only the house remained in presentable shape; hiding the monstrous secrets it had far below. This house was now an AIRBNB owned by a soon to be ""canceled"" actor accused of sexual ""misconduct"".He arrives and upon discovering the underground layers, begins tape measuring them top see what square footage could be added to the real estate! Whereas previous characters reeled in horror at the bloody bedding, cages, etc; the actor simply sees dollar signs!! Personally this was a needed laugh!Justin Long who plays AJ, the disgraced actor, is perfect in the role. His merrily measuring the width and length past the gruesome evidence of wrong doing was, to me, pretty hilarious.As for it being a horror movie it surely was; was nothing horror fans have not seen before is such 70's cult classics like ""Don't Look in the Basement"". Calling it ""Barbarians"" was also misleading. While the actions of one man were truly barbaric, barbarians suggests a nest of such people. A tribe like ""The Hills Have Eyes"". Other than one character warning that ""she ain't the worst of them""; we see no one but the initial antagonist and the wretched offspring of his perverse insanity. Who were the others??I expected many more deformed or depraved denizens since the title of the movie was ""BARBARIANS"".",2022-10-29
"WARNING: Do not read this review if you want to watch the movie. It's only entertaining if you don't know what's going on.The movie relied on shock value for no reason. The plot-twists were so drastic you might as well call them plot changes. The ideas were great and had so much potential only for it to be about something completely unrelated. Around the ending hal of the movie there was a new plot brought in and then the movie ended it unresolved. Everything was unresolved. The build up for the original occupant of the house only for him to be there for three seconds. The monster having a backstory that doesn't answer much. The black guy being introduced as all mysterious and stuff only for him to die without learning anything about him or anything new. The guy with the SA charge was so useless, they should have kept the first guy.This movie was a mess. Felt like a bunch of unfiltered thoughts. Only thing that kept me going was theorizing about the unknown.",2023-06-18
"Really.... This started really well and I was really intrigued by the relationship between the two characters sharing the Airbnb. I assumed he was some kind of psychopath as he seemed to nice to start with and that he would turn into a weirdo at some point.But no.... Instead, a naked woman running around the basement with super human strength and a fetish for force breast feeding people. This is the point where I realised the director and writers were high.We then get a clip of the man that originally owned the house hunting for women to prey on..... but the film doesn't explain any of it....utterly pointless.Seriously I could go on but this was the worst film I have ever seen, and I've seen ""jaws, the revenge"".",2022-10-28
"Barbarian gets a lot right, but it also flubs a lot. But my main issue with it is that a lot of what it does is ultimately pointless, other than being there as fan service or because the creators wanted to put in a quote or reference for the sake of putting it in.The characters are nicely set up, and can keep you guessing for a bit as to their motivations, but ultimately that tension doesn't contribute to the story - and unsatisfyingly resolves for many of them. Many of the characters take complete u-turns in terms of motivation or personality and although that in itself could be considered a bit of a trope for some of them, it just doesn't do anything for the movie.Similarly, there are some really strong and well-executed style choices that evoke movies like Candyman or Parents, while more obviously referencing stuff like Don't Breathe and Hostel. But they seem to be in there just for the sake of being in there.You could say that the character setups, the style choices, etc. Are all there to set an expectation to then subvert that expectation. But my problem is that the makers require us to know all these tropes and styles to be affected in that way, but if you are that kind of person, the effect in the end is quite weak because you won't be that surprised.I'm sorry to say that it all feels like not particularly clever people trying to come off as clever. But perhaps that's just the aging cynic in me, perhaps this movie is not for 47-year old cinema veterans, but for the new wave of teenage movie lovers that know just enough to get most of the references, while not having seen something like Barbarian executed before.",2022-10-22
"SPOILERS AHEADOverall the film is great; the cinematography, performances, and design were amazing and added to the story. However; their recent campaign of this being an unexpected intense/extreme movie left me wanting more. While still a great film, I never found myself thinking ""woah how did this get R"" like I did with recent films like Men and Crimes of the Future. At times, the film hints at this path where things could go very dark and very intense, but ultimately not much is seen. I especially felt this when the tunnels went pretty unexplored. I really expected more rooms filled with previous victims or other horrid creatures, but the most we got was an old man and the implication of something far more brutal than what we see. What cemented this feeling was the ending of the movie; I felt bad for our creature that clearly longed to be a mother at her core, but the history of how she became so brutal and survived is never mentioned. It felt like a scene that should've followed after more information on the man and what he did to the women and specifically her was told.Despite this, I do think this movie is a must see because it is very well made and thrilling, but don't think it's going to be something brutal and boundary pushing.",2022-09-10
"A lot of movies of late have been overburdened with messaging, to the detriment of the story. The point of entertainment is... to entertain. If instead of getting entertained you get lectured, you stop coming back.Barbarian does seem part of a new trend where effort was made to put entertainment first.Does it succeed 100%? That's a high bar. It succeeds enough. This is not a great movie, but it is certainly a good enough movie. (doesn't stick the landing though).If you watch this, you will not be berated for how your ancestors lived. But you will be treated to some fresh pacing and innovative camera usage. It has a ""plausible"" storyline. (no ghosts or aliens). And the characters are largely believable in their choices. Mostly.While the premise of men being monsters has been done before, this is presented in a fashion which you haven't really seen before. And even though credibility goes out the window in the last 15 minutes, the movie has given you enough prior to this point that you can forgive a few shortcomings.Important point. This movie does NOT have fountains of blood and/or gore. Not saying it's rated G. But Saw this ain't.Not many jump scares. But MUCH of the movie has you a bit on edge and claustrophobic. That part is done fairly well.It's a moderately well put together moderately fresh idea with some innovation on tone, pacing, and cinematography.If you see this, I think you will walk away entertained. Even if you walk away saying that the ending came a bit off the rails.Go see it. These days you could do far worse.",2022-12-14
"I honestly can't remember the last time I had as much fun in a movie theatre as I did watching Barbarian.It has a little bit of everything to appease all horror fans. There's an element of haunted house style horror, body horror, mystery, perversion. If you like any kind of horror there'll be something in this film for you to get stuck into.All of these elements come together to make a truly wild ride of a plot that will keep you glued to the screen.The feel of the film is spot, expertly switching styles and tones which make for such a rich and engaging viewing experience.The performances are top notch from the entire cast, who all bring a different energy and style to the piece.Sure this film isn't perfect but by god is it fun and that's the reason I watch films.

This movie made no sense! It was completely stupid. I wish I could get my money and time back from watching this movie. There was a lot of random things added to the movie to fill time that really didn't need to be in the movie because it was never explained. Seriously don't waste your money or time on this crummy film you will be just as disappointed!Even my husband thought to movie was ridiculously stupid and a complete waste of time. Worst day night ever. Don't see it. I would truly give 0 stars if I could. It was a big fat dud! Don't see it. I would truly give 0 stars if I could. It was a big fat dud!,2022-09-20
"This film is easily one of the most anticipated of 2022, and it was a shame that it wasn't in theaters - it really does wonders for the mystery thriller genre.The actors all do an amazing job and the script is very suspensful and cleverly written, with lots of absurd and surrealistic twists and turns. It is not for the faint of heart, but it is just not lots of gore for the sake of it, rather in service of the story.The effects, when utilized fully, are amazing and complimentary to the script in wonderful ways, the the cinematography is great.All in all, an amazing film that is very much recommended!",2023-01-06
"From the depiction of a failed Detroit to the premise of a bad reservation, this film has a keen sense of realistic forboding dred. Cinematography for what this film represents was stellar. Acting was above par. Definately worth the ticket sale, pretty orignal and I look forward to more from this director. Bill is awesome as usual and he is working his way into becoming a great actor that you can depend on. The scenery hurt, makes you glad you don't ever want to see it again and the back story is vomit inducing. This is horrible story telling that makes you hope that this type of thing is point blank fiction, where people like this only exsist in our nightmares. Highly recommended for fans of this type of ride.",2022-10-28
"I pondered whether to write a review about this or not, because it's not Horrible, but it isn't good either.For the first half of this movie, the characters make every wrong turn seen on any horror film or even a comedic spoof of a horror film, yet they without explanation, without any rational or even emotional purpose to just make the stupidest decisions possible, and by the movie's med-point they gave almost all of it away.You sort of know now what's waiting for you, then 10-15 mins through the 2nd half, they gave the rest away, so at the 1-hour mark (give or take) it becomes just a thriller no horror.And for that 1st hour, you just get build up and some jump scares, the cheap kind of jump scares.The thing is, the premise is very good, and it had a lot of potential, but it wasn't let down by the actors, they did what they're asked to do, the issue here was the writing and directing.I'm not going to till you not to watch it, I'm just tilling you expect very little from this movie.",2022-10-26
"If you've seen the preview for Barbarian, you've seen the promising set-up: woman checks into an airbnb to find someone else is already there, then some very creepy things start to go down.At least, that's the premise for the first third of the film. Unfortunately, the filmmakers think they're Hitchcock (they're not) and attempt to pull a bait and switch a la Psycho that is more disappointing than surprising. The entire tone of the film shifts away from horror, there's a tacked on backstory, and none of the themes are developed (is this a revenge story? Is it about men? Why is it set in Detroit?). Because of the tonal shift, the creepiness descends into farce, and the bait and switch starts to feel like a con job. Most of the people in the cinema I saw it in were laughing at the scares by the end.",2022-10-21
"Barbarian is a new horror mystery directed and written by Zach Cregger, director of Miss March and The Civil War on Drugs.In the film, Tess (Georgina Campbell) has a job interview in town and has therefore booked an Airbnb for the evening. Once at the Airbnb, she learns that it has been double-booked and that the mysterious Keith (Bill Skarsgård) had already moved in. During her stay, she learns that the house, the people and the neighborhood don't seem to be as familiar as she first thought.For a more unknown and aspiring director and writer, Zach Cregger manages to provide an interesting horror mystery. The film is also promoted in the right mysterious way, so that as a viewer you don't know exactly what to expect. They make this movie look like a horror game like Resident Evil or Silent Hill where you gain more and more access to the place after a while. So you learn more and more horrible and brutal secrets of the house. In this way they provide more and more tension in the film without, for example, using lame jump scares. The film is also presented in such a way that you as a viewer become increasingly curious about what else is in the house, which keeps you well into the story. Unfortunately, the tension of the film does decrease when most questions of the mysteries are answered, but fortunately you remain curious how the film ends.Because of the mysterious environment and how the house and the different rooms are portrayed, they create an uncomfortably scary atmosphere. This goes well in the beginning with a suitable soundtrack. Most of the frightening things in the film are also conveyed in a believable way with only the help of good acting and make-up effects and otherwise keeping it well hidden in the dark.The acting is also well portrayed in the film. Georgina Campbell comes across as a curious tenant of the mysterious house and fortunately often makes good decisions. Unfortunately, she does commit some horror clichés, but these don't come across as disturbing. After playing the clown Pennywise in the It films, Bill Skarsgård easily comes across as a creepy person. As a viewer, just like the characters in the film, you often remain a bit insecure about him, despite the fact that he tries to come across as nice and helpful. Justin Long plays a more entertaining role as a spoiled egotist, who also ends up in the house at one point. He manages to provide a somewhat lighter period, but once in the secret rooms of the house, the darkness in his scenes also gradually increases.",2022-10-30
"This movie really did things in a surprisingly different manner. It necessarily does not avoid all the common horror movie cliches (especially the ending). However, from the very beginning, you find yourself desperately interested in the plot and the characters. The movie really is at it's best when you don't have a clue what is happening. So if possible, avoid watching the highly spoiler-full trailer.Overall, a positively surprising movie with a wonderful half-humorous and still gritty and dark atmosphere. I believe the Barbarian really benefits from having a relatively low budget - it focuses on the relevant aspects.I highly recommend checking this one out!",2022-11-05
"I had a fine time with this movie. Its premise is fairly original, there's a fine amount of suspense and jump-scares, and the acting of both Georgina Campbell and Justin Long is great. Such a pity that the appearance of Bill Skarsgard was cut short (pun intended!), albeit he went out with a very noteworthy bang! Director and writer Zach Cregger lets the whole narrative seemingly turnover two times, making you for a short time think that you were by mistake launched into a totally different movie, and then he cleverly intertwined them all. I also liked the way he played with the characters of Bill Skarsgard and Justin Long, letting you as long as possible in doubt if they were good or bad (with as cynical highlight Justin Long's demasqué in the climax of the movie.My only reservation concerns the creature in the basement. Its origin and motives were at least original, but to be honest: she mostly looked like a 100 years old bag lady, stripped to her wrinkled bare skin. And when she started cooing and breastfeeding (really!) her victims, it all became really too grotesque and with that a bit ludicrous. Fortunately for horror and gore lovers at least her actions were pretty awesome, and warranted an exciting and nerve-racking last part of the movie.",2022-11-08
"I gave it 2 for the acting only (which deserves 10 out of 10). The story itself was terrible. I kept waiting for something terrifying or some unique plot twist to happen, to no avail. Why such fine actors accepted these roles is beyond me. This a B grade film at best. The hype, both pre to and post release, must've been fabricated by the movie's makers... no true horror fan would give it such high praise. I don't typically give films low ratings, as a lot of work goes into making them. This one, however, deserves to be torn to pieces. I think the actors must have been desperate for roles, but I can't see why as all are well respected, fine actors.",2022-10-28
"I heard this was a good movie, recommanded by peoples, reviews and score being positive. I almost watched it last year during Halloween season but ran out of time so kept it for this year. I was really expecting it to be my ""piece of resistance"" of my 20 or so movie ""marathon"" along Bodies Bodies Bodies. Yet both these 2 movies so far are the stinkers, and i watched low budget tv movies in there...The start is ""solid"" but drag on way too long. I mean there is tensions and you really spend quite some time with the 2 characters. Its interesting material to keep you guessing but its such a slow burn tough. But fine... If it lead somewhere interesting, i could had forgiven the movie for it.Then almost an hour into the movie you get introduced to Justin Long character and the movie finally become an horror movie but the pay off is really not worth the investement.Without spoiling anything, you must suspend your disbelieves so much in this movie that its comical.At just 1h40, the movie feel like 2h20 minutes due to how slowburn it is at first, and then the ridiculous nonsense jump in and you just roll your eyes.Im being very generous by giving it a 4/10 (2 stars on LB) because the acting was solid, there some interesting imagery, but ultimately its basically a 30 minute short movie idea stretched in a feature film.",2023-10-17
"How stupid can a character act?Well, this movie tries to answer that very question. Let's consider a few:1) Why did the guy, after having encoutered an hysterical roommate, not report back earlier? He would only be away for 30sec, but he went exploring way beyond the agreed upon area.2) The 2nd guy that came into the house must have been stupider still. He did not even notice all the blood and the akward settings in the basement. He just went on continuing measuring the space.3) Why did we need to get introduced to this second guy in the first place?4) This savage women is way too strong. There is nothing in the movie that explains why this 'creature' should posses such great strength.5) How did this creature and 'father' manage to survive al these years (like decades)?The story is very, very unbelievable.I have no problem suspending my disbelief, but this one takes the cake. I definitely would not recommend this movie to anyone. I occasionally reached for my phone while watching this piece of crap.",2022-10-27
"I don't understand all the hype around this movie, seriously. I have to agree with a previous review on here that said something like 'the first 40min or so are enjoyable, the rest is non sense'. It's nonsense but not in a good way. I was left with so many questions. The marketing for this movie is close to none, and I thought it was for a good reason. Well, it is not. It's a simple film, with a simple premise, simple shots and simple special effects. I enjoyed the first half, but then it became super generic. I though there would be something more terrifying underground. People kept saying there were multiple gory scenes in this movie and it was all so gruesome - grow the f up, there are 3 bloody scenes if not less. I'm so disappointed. Go watch the latest version of evil dead or the cabin in the woods instead. Those are real horror treats.",2022-10-26
After reading these good reviews I asked myself did These people watch a different movie than this one? LolSo many plot holes to where you just keep saying to yourself during the movie omg this is so dumb and not believableThe girl keeps wanting to go in and try to save a Guys life who could have been the killer himselfShe decided to come back and stay there again after her job interview instead of finding another place to stayThey both have Airbnb reservations confirmed and the property manager tells the owner there's no one thereThe tunnel build below the house was built almost as good as a drug tunnel for el Chapo. How the hell did one old guy build that tunnel through solid rock with no heavy equipment? Where did he dump all the dirt he removed? One man would take over 100 years to complete thatIt started off good but as it went on you get let down. Might as well been a ghost or demon instead of an inbred daughter. That would have been more believable hahaWatch a bootleg online if you must still see this. Don't waste your money or time.,2022-09-17
"The film starts well enough, with good acting, suspense, and a couple of characters you're scratching your head at, wondering if they're innocent characters or malevolent actors.However, once the film really gets going (after a toilet paper scene), and we descend into the bowels of the house, the film descends with it. A refreshing change half way through the film holds our attention, but while the audience imagine these separate segments are building to something greater, we find only incoherence, loose ends, and plot holes.The start of Barbarian is highly believable, the premise is a seemingly innocent double booking of an AirBnB and no easy accommodation solutions. From here, characters make increasingly illogical and inconsistent decisions and things slowly stop making sense.",2023-10-31
"Was really interested to see this movie as the trailers didn't give anything away at all and left it as a mystery of sorts and I was intrigued. The movie started off great and it was like slowly building up to have Bill Skarsgard be the villain or so the movie wanted you to think as you followed Tess the main character. But oh god was that wrong! If you've seen the film and you know the scene with Bill then wow that was crazy and brutal! Whole section of that with Bill and Tess talking and passing dialogue to created this awkward, funny and tense situations to get to that was crazy. Then right after that crazy ass scene it had a weird tone shift and felt like a weird scene to put after. We got introduced to a character who was the classic dumb horror character, I won't lie it was pretty funny as he went in the house trying to sell it and every scary thing or every bit of blood he saw he just ignored and continued to measure. It was actually one of my favourite parts of the movie and was funny! Those are the only parts I liked. The rest of the movie felt wasted. The tones were all over the place and it felt messy and cut together really weirdly. I had no problem with the ""monster"" in the movie but the intentions of the monster just seemed unnecessary weird, if they were going for unsettling I guess they did their job but it was a weird type of it and kind of made it seem dumb at times. There were parts of the movie which didn't seem to be needed at all like the unnecessary sub plot of one of the characters being an actor who is in a sexual assault case as that didn't lead to anything. The ending felt a little rushed and unsatisfying especially with how it cut to credits and what part it decided to do that on. I believe a better ending was cut out somewhere. The movie definitely could've benefited from being tidying up more to feel less messy and blend the tones together to make that work, also some of the plot just was not good and unnecessary to say the least. I did enjoy the first act of the movie and the first few things I said in the review though. Disappointed after that.",2022-11-02
"So in short, movie feels rushed, in some moments there are just cuts to the next scene, and movie is not well thought true. Edited Screenplay feels bad and illogical, editing is worst I seen in years, in one cut doors are open in other closed, no one even tried to fix it in post. This and mutch more just shows how underexperienced director is, and, unable to do a good job, even if you are not interested or getting well paid , just don't leav such mistakes, it's your name...And imdb rating is too high , this also shows that people don't watch movies and just don't understand how bad this one is compared to others.",2022-10-29
"I don't understand how this movie is getting good ratings. It is one of those movies where the characters make obviously dumb and unrealistic choices. It isn't scary other then a few parts. The creature is kind of comical, not scary. The character victims also make a TON of mistakes like tripping constantly or dropping weapons or forgetting they even have weapons. And there are many looonnng scenes that aren't necessary to the plot. For example, the movie spends about 20 minutes giving some back story on one of the characters, but it isn't necessary for the plot. There are also scenes that don't make sense.",2022-11-02
"Wow. This is a brilliant piece of film making. I was shocked at how good this was. Firstly it's not your typical horror. It's more intense and has a good storyline attached to it. I was expecting something along the lines of a slasher pic but I was really pleasently surprised at this. How the film is split into 3 sections is not just brilliant but it's executed supberbly. It's jumpy, edgy, nervy, creepy all in one. The 80's throwback section even incorperates the the preinvention of wide screen TV's. Everything is just really well done. Grab the popcorn and prepare for a real treat. Oh and Justin Long is exceptional in this.",2022-10-28
"The only reason I watched this because I keep bumping on this movie in my every social meadia accounts. I tried to watched it hoping itll great because they say its good.I have watched it is ""Never trust a review from a random shxthead on social media"".Weak plot, so many plotholes and relatively slow and draggy. First 40 mins was big waste of time. No, the movie itself is a waste of time. The plottwist is not even that good. Also the deaths were meaningless and nonsense. The direction of the story was shxt and the characters were just a puppet to make a death on horror movie. Stupid characters specially the guy who measured the tunnel like it was nothing suspicious. Its not even that scary and the whole baby thing was pure nonsense. First rundown , just two strangers meeting each other because of an irreponsible property management. Then that goes literally half of the movie itself. Then the other stranger goes kaboom his head out of nowhere.Just one of the worst of horror movies Ive seen. Good movie my axx you bots.",2022-10-29
"1st 15 minutes was a little interesting, but got kinda boring. Was wondering, is anything gonna happen? Is the movie ever gonna ever get outta the house?Then, it got a lot more interesting. That moment quickly changed. It felt like it jumped to another movie. Literally thought I was watching a commercial. ""Oh, can they put a commercial in a movie? Like this is intermission?""But, this ""commercial"" did make the movie a lot more interesting.Problem with the movie is they too quickly jumped around without giving any good explanations. Oh, that just happened? Hmm, why? And you never learn why any of it happened.",2022-09-23
"From one horror enthusiast to another, just give it a chance and watch. It channels atmosphere of some of the greatest and blends them together seamlessly, from The Descent to The Poughkeepsie Tapes. Barbarian avoids many of the pitfalls of the majority current horror, i.e. An unpredictable story that keeps you guessing, intrigued, all the while on the edge of your seat, depth and emotion in places you least expect, and genuinely tense atmosphere throughout. While not reliant on jumpscares, it managed to startle me a couple times. The acting was nothing to scoff about either, all actors played their parts brilliantly, comedic and light when they need to be, rigid and scared when they need to. Definitely worth the worth for anyone interested in horror as a genre, and hoping for maybe a prequel.",2022-09-12
"Personally I find this movie to be a product of over hyping Movies, I had no plans to see this going into the weekend when I saw multiple reviews stating how good it was. So I figured I'd give it a shot. I was disappointed, the opening feels tense and we all have our theories before we go in, mine were wrong but, it would have been better had it been generic.The movie tries to be something special, trying a bit too hard to be honest, not going into spoilers but the movie has one decent scare and it burns that in the trailer, but my biggest gripe is absolute pacing. The movie has three distinct Acts the first is kinda good, meanwhile the second and Third are mixed together, not too good effect. They do a cut to the past in which it fully explains what is happening (while creating a terrible plot hole), but it ultimately means nothing, much Like Justin Longs part in this. It is acted well no problems there, but I feel the direction was fine but the story and plot both go no where and ultimately as I said before it tries to subvert expectations and I think that's where it falls flat.",2022-10-16
"Barbarian is a cult classic in the making for sure. One of those rare exceptions of a horror movie turned on it's head. I think most avid horror moviegoers will find this film highly enjoyable for a simple story that then turns into something more massive than expected.While I find the movie highly enjoyable, there are of course few faults to be found. I couldn't exactly specify them in this review just due to spoilers but all I can hint towards is the actual reveal in the film, and my problems concerning that.Altogether though, the pacing and characters are really appealing (somewhat dumb and arrogant too) but they hold their own in this movie for the better part.Practically speaking, the gore effects and the violence is pretty tame compared to other horror films that have been out this year- but I think the movie sells more on the tension and suspense that you develop from watching each minute pass by throughout the film.Definitely a solid horror movie to check out in theaters or at home when you can.",2022-09-12
"Now, with all the hype behind this movie when it came out, I was expecting MUCH more. This movie fell short in so many ways, and ultimately just left me shaking my head, but glad I didn't see it in theaters.1) COUNTLESS plot holes, to the point where the unbelievably ruined the redeemable qualities of the film such as some of the shots, music, etc...
2) Bare minimum character development, except the budding of a relationship that was ended up serving zero purpose to the overall story.3) Silly ""monster"" that was not what we were all expecting from the trailers.Overall: Not thrilling, enthralling, nail biting. Just...cringeworthy.Side note: WTH is the Barbarian??? The man who was kidnapping ladies?",2022-11-08
"I can truly say that this is one of the most unique horror films out there. I have seen many of them, but this one is completely different. It's been a while since I watched this movie, but I can't forget it because it was shocking.So the film tells the story of a woman who, staying at an Airbnb, discovers that the house she has rented has a secret tunnel that leads to an unknown destination. Later we see another story, about a man who owns that house and he doesn't even know about any secret tunnel, to know the layout of the house he also goes to that tunnel. And then the paths of both characters cross and they face the secrets and horrors that lie within this house.The movie is definitely worth watching. This is something completely new, something that hasn't happened before. A unique story, terrifying scenes, unpredictable plot - that's what a horror movie needs.",2023-02-10

"The first 40 minutes of this film is great. The acting is spot on, Fantastic and very original story line ,creepy atomsphere and full of potential. Another positive about the first part is you dont know whats going to happen, you dont know what kind of path it will go down. If it continued like this it would of easily rated an 8 or even 9/10. But as the film goes on it loses its sense of horror and becomes daft and more of a comedy, real shame. It also feels like a different director takes over half way through and changes the film completely. The trailer is misleading aswell as this only shows you the darker/ more creepy bits and you would believe it would be a straight out horror thriller where as i believe its more of a horror comedy!",2022-11-09
"I didn't watch the full trailer as I immediately liked the look of the first 15 seconds. I had a rough idea of what was coming due to the suspense that was building and the usual typical movie formulas. This did not follow any typical formula whatsoever! It was a totally unique movie that thought outside the box and used its own ideas and creative writing. If you are someone that can appreciate thriller/horror movies and story telling together that are not generic - I bet you will love it too! The acting performances were great all-round, and I can promise no predictable ending from the start unlike most ""scary"" movies. Best movie of 2022 for me.",2022-10-29
A friend raved about it so I watched. The first half moved so slowly. The next quarter sped up a bit and the last quarter was a bit faster. The story wasn't very original.

"I found this movie to be quite unique in its distinct 3 part segmentation. The first part of the movie was the most suspenseful and left you feeling curious, the acting and dynamic between the leads was definitely something that kept you intrigued - great storyline on its own.The second part took on a completely new life & world, and credit to the film it did a really good job of effectively starting up a new movie mid-way through. You got character backstory/context very quickly but it didn't feel unnatural in its own realm. Good enough storyline but the set up of whether you love or loathe the character is pretty much set in stone for the viewer, so it left little to the imagination.The third section, was where I got nervous, questioning how they were going to successfully cover off on newly introduced character arcs that actually seem so integral to the movie (and probably could have benefited from playing out earlier). This third chapter was undoubtedly the weakest link in the movie as they crammed many themes in that could have otherwise, been carefully unpacked throughout.I understand the low ratings especially due to the ending but I understand the higher ratings based on the overall entertainment value and unique structure to the film. There was some solid acting throughout & I'm sure that at least the first segment will inspire some further movies like this in this genre which is exciting.",2023-03-30
"I relaxed on the couch, turned off the lights and went deep in to the film like any other movie. Always giving a slack with minor issues and dumb desissions of the characters. This Time I was very disappointed and frustrated. After the end of very promising and excellent building up tension first act,we jump in to a different film. Really it was like they Said ""ok let's f###k up this thing"". Human centipede was Way better film than this one. I found my self jumping from frustration to laugh on the second act more times than Hayden Christensen on 'jumper'. I really wanted to like this film,but barbarian did a successful job to turn a rating of solid 7,8-8 of the first act,to solid 3 in the end. BADbarian.",2022-11-14
"""Its so cooooold in the D""😆.. when u get a chance, YouTube it, then you'll get it lol. Anyway this was highly, and I do mean highly entertaining. You're gonna say ""this stupid matha..."" a lot lol.. and also scratch your head a lot if you dig too deep into movies like I do.. but in my opinion... none the less entertaining. I enjoyed it. Funny, ahhh for some i can see how it might be scary but I'm such a horror buff, I haven't seen a scary movie that actually made me jump probably since the 1st conjuring. But like I said, it was good to me, its definitely gonna have to be in my collection and I haven't been able to say that about a new movie since... since... I actually don't know how long, it's been a while. So anyway, yea, check it out 👌🏼",2022-10-28
"This is a beautifully shot independent horror film. However, I don't get the ultimate trending thing. It's really good, but astonishing, no. I guess maybe it's pro female, so whatever. I liked that as the males in this movie, except for Keith, sucked. As a social worker in a place where our less populated areas have issues, there is nothing shocking here. I have worse stories I can't discuss. So, don't rush to this movie, but do watch it as an evening scare on your tv.The sound on this movie is amazing and definitely sets a tone. I think the reality of the Detroit area the protagonist was in is very upsetting because it's probably real.So, see this movie on a rainy night, but there is nothing here that explains it's trending.",2022-10-31
"Fantastic horror movie that blends 3 stories into one and moves around the timeline quite brilliantly.The triumphs here are the story, the screenplay and the direction. Zach Cregger is definitely one for the future. He has crafted a movie that moves suspicions from one character to another and just when you think you know where the movie is going, it takes a sharp left turn into horror street.The acting is all good, Skarsgard, long and Campbell are all convincing in their roles.The only nit picks I have are the annoying cops and the cliched gun drop at the end but other than that, bravo, great film.",2022-11-23
"What a chaotic movie! Barbarian is a strange film that certainly accomplishes one thing: surprising and overturning expectations. It succeeds somewhat less in maintaining consistency and credibility. Overall, it is a very smooth-moving, highly entertaining film, if one chooses to ignore the obvious forcedness of it.The first part of the picture is arguably the best handled, with palpable tension culminating in the discovery of the secret of the house. What comes after is more muddled and boorish, in a citation of multiple cult horror films and with cacophony of different themes. The whole issues of the concept of abuse and about the owner of the house are quite sketchy and superficial.Particular praise in choosing to use Bill Skarsgard, whom one would expect as the big bad, as a lark's mirror, a choice I found well thought out.",2022-10-27
"Had a blast watching this film! The plot was original and refreshing but still daring enough to pivot the story in a different direction with each act. I literally couldn't make out which way the story was going up until the credits ran,but I loved that lol. There we're a few cliches and plot conveniences,such as the main character(s) booking an airb&b in an extremely dangerous part of Detroit without doing their research. Or how said Airb&b owner purchased the house with no prior knowledge of its history or the deserted and destroyed neighborhood surrounding it. Surely previous renters must've either gone missing or filed reports that would've raise concerns to any homeowner, if-for anything, for financial reasons. Silly,irresponsible,life threatening decisions like these were a central theme amongst characters which basically served the plot HOWEVER most of them are genuinely forgivable as most character(s),for better or worse, are somewhat relatable and we're forced to root for them as they navigate the many monkey wrenches thrown at them throughout the film. But overall it was suspenseful, chilling, gory and surprisingly funny at times. What more could you ask for from a fall thriller?!Hot takes***
-I think they could potentially be setting up a sequel. The film hints at different points that there maybe a hidden antagonist not shown..We know there is a property manager who has authorization but we never learn who double booked the airb&b,which seemed calculated
-Then right before Justin Long finds the father,we hear a scream coming from down a hall that not only doesn't resemble the ""mother"" but was not coming from her direction ..
-Then the homeless man said mother was not the worst thing down there.this could've been hinting to the father but he was just a sick old man but she was a superhuman abomination, what could be worse than that??",2022-09-28
"I must start this review by saying I was so hyped up to see this mess that I'm now angry at it. I guess the high expectations contributed to the feeling of being cheated.Let's see... The plot is dumb and completely unlikely to happen in real life. Yeah, I know, it's a movie, but, please do not offend the audience's intelligence. C'mon!I really can't believe people are so amped up about this.Skip it. It sucks. No, it's not creepy enough. No, it's not clever. It is kinda surprising, I'll give them that, but not in a good way.Bad.*Oh, and for the record, Terrifier 2 is also not as good as people are saying it is. The first one is way better.",2022-10-27
"A bit of an identity crisis within story arc but I suppose that's what makes it work in a way that doesn't make the film predictable or stay dependant on the usual horror tropes.Very nice atmospheres and if the viewer commits there are payoffs in that alone, with the lingering sense of dread throughout. The acting I felt was sufficient to carry the material with the third act being the low part for me anyways. I tend to stay away from spoilers but would've liked to see the writing as strong on the way out as it was on the way in. Skargarrd is good and has a singular duty and that's one of what you think and perceive he is, until...well, he isn't. This I didn't mind so much as the story shifted into gear and now without the ""usual"" narrative.What I did mind was the last 20 minutes felt like a rush, writing wise, to finish up some loose ends, but felt forced and a bit silly.6.5/10 for the quality of filmmaking up until the wheels just started to fall off.",2022-10-31
"It was an interesting concept at the beginning and very intriguing and eerie at times and even had me on the edge of my seat, but as soon as you find out what is causing all this it just becomes another campy monster chase flick with minor twist and turns and the monster costume isn't even that scary! It's more of a sad tale than frightening. Take a page from Alfred Hitchcock: The human imagination is far scarier than anything anyone can produce on screen. Make your audience believe it without showing it and you've created terror.But, what can you expect from a guy who has never directed horror. Seriously, bad hiring.Also, how is a house in the middle of the dangerous part of Detroit (movies words not mine) that is surrounded by other houses that have already been ransacked and destroyed, still completely untouched? Even the outside would have been graffitied on and dirty and grungy!",2023-01-22
"I red great reviews, and seeing a commercial horror movie scoring more than 7/10 on imdb, I needed to check it out.The premise of the movie is great. It is best you don't know too much, so you can fully enjoy what is going on, and suspect whatever could go wrong. The acting of both actors are great, their life choices clearly not. This is where the story goes already a bit too wild for me. Locking doors of a bathroom to be safe, but going down a dark, deep hole with scary noises?Then halfway, the movie shifts tone and story.It gets from thriller to gore, mixed with humor (well I hope that was the meaning of it). The more you get to the end of the movie, the crazier it gets... policemen not even interested, crazy homeless people, a selfish film maker,... then there is a short but crazy back story going on... it all becomes a bit messy, still original and different, but when the film ended, I was literally questioning myself what I just witnessed? (And not in a good way).",2022-11-07
"Barbarian is my type of horror movie; It is a slow build to some absolute horrors. Occasionally I enjoy a horror movie with little to no script containing lots of blood. Though, there is something about the build-up of a good horror movie. This film features slow build-ups that reveal some horrifying secrets. I was hesitant at one point because I felt this was just another run-of-the-mill horror movie, but I'm glad I stuck it out because I was amazed.Barbarian has some much excellence to it that I'm not sure where to begin. The first thing I would like to highlight is the performances of its main cast. While Bill Skarsgård was good, I would like to laud the performances of Georgina Campbell (Tess) and Justin Long (AJ). Campbell's performance as the main character Tess is one of my favorite performances by an actress in any movie this year. While Justin Long is typically casted as loveable and charming characters, he veers from his usual cast type to deliver a fantastic supporting performance. This film marks Zach Cregger's solo directing debut. Based on how he builds up the film's horror, you would think he was a Hollywood veteran. One of the complaints I've seen about this film is the tonal shift. I feel that tonal shift perfectly works to set up the film's second act and introduce you to some horrors that were even worse than you might have expected.10/10 It is One of my favorite horror films of the past five years, built on the back of some terrific performances, an outstanding atmosphere, and some truly-terrifying scenes.",2022-12-11
"I started watching this movie thinking about the possible horror movie clichés: a girl who is alone goes to an airbnb which is occupied by a young man... strange. The young man doesn't give the feeling to be trusted. In a real life situation, this would have been a real crime scene that's for sure.Everything gives you the sensation that something bad is going to happen to the girl, and the boy and the basement will have something to do with it.The viewer is waiting for the scare... but then something happens anyone was prepared to.I like this movie so much because of it. It has calm where there should be scares and it has scares when anyone is waiting for it.I liked the humor behind this situations too. At one point in the movie another character is introduced, we didn't know why and how, but he ends up with the girl.The final is almost perfect.If you are a true hardcore horror lover, this movie might not be for you but if you are like me, who likes a little bit of dark humor mixed with horror, this is your movie.",2023-05-03
"I tried to watch this movie. I really did. I am sure it is a horrific movie based on the reviews that I've seen. But Tess is the most naive and dumbest character in a horror movie that I've ever witnessed. As if the secret room with the and camera, along with the bloody handprint on the wall wasn't bad enough and didn't give her the biggest RED FLAG WARNING you could ever imagine, she just had to go chasing Keith down into the secret staircase. I turned it off when poor Keith get his head bashed in by the naked lady in the rubber suit. Oh my.

I'm not even sure what I just saw but it feels like someone who wrote the first 15 minutes of the movie and botched the rest.I guess movies theses day's are just about making money with no content. This movie is one of the best example of this so I give them 10/10 on money making. Taking people for idiots.The brilliance of what marketing can do is to the infinite incredible and nobody needs this kind of feeling specially during these horrible years.Screw your movie.",2022-10-27
"God I love a horror movie that scares you through the suspense, tension and visuals without jump scares galore.The first act is incredibly suspenseful because of the main lead, played terrifically by Georgia Campbell, entering a house with an unknown stranger. The director really makes us worry for her and even manages to make tea look scary. Bill Skarsgård is the stranger and he really knows how to creep you out. Justin Long is also in the film and he is great as this douche character.It's quite bonkers after the first act and also humorous but in a really dark way.I highly recommend coming into this with minimal knowledge just to experience what is a breath of fresh air in the horror genre!",2022-10-29
Tess is going to Detroit for a job interview on a documentary. She books an Airbnb in Brentwood on Barbary Street. The neighborhood is run down. As it turns out the place is double booked and Keith (Bill Skarsgård) is also there. She spends the night. The next day she discovers a secret basement passage and a woman where it appears someone was imprisoned and filmed. She starts to leave when Keith shows up and wants to see the room. There is something down there in the passage.The film changes scene to AJ (Justin Long) an Hollywwod type accused of rape by actress Meagan Maddox. To save money he will have to sell his home and go live in his Brentwood rental where he hears a noise in the basement and goes and investigates.The film had a good build up. As in most films the creature horror was not as good as the build up.Guide: F-word. No sex. Fake nudity.,2022-11-23
"This movie was mysterious and you alway want to see what is happening next. It start with a woman going into a airbnb and we don't know what is going on in this house.(I don't know btw who had the idea for 600 characters minimum for review, this is too long for no reason)The actors are good, the story is good. It's not a movie that give no answers, we get an explanation on why those things are happening.Only downside for me was the police reaction. I wonder if the producer is very objective with the law force. I really believe they would not act like this.Really surprised with those 3/10 and 4/10 reviews. If this is 3/10, then most horror movies would be like -12/10. It's worth watching for sure.",2022-11-19
"First of all, I have to say that I don't understand the title of the movie. And when I stumbled upon it here in 2022, of course I stopped to take notice. And I hadn't expected that a movie titled ""Barbarian"" would be a horror movie. So naturally, I was intrigued.Writer and director Zach Cregger managed to put together a very unique and enjoyable horror movie with ""Barbarian"". It was a movie that felt like something that had found its way from the 1980s. A very stylish, memorable and enjoyable horror movie. It was refreshing to see this type of horror movie being made in 2022.The movie has a very interesting cast ensemble with the likes of Georgina Campbell, Bill Skarsgård, Justin Long and Richard Brake. They were really nicely cast for their roles. And it was an absolute pleasure to see Bill Skarsgård in the movie, and he really surprised me with his performance. As did Justin Long with his performance as AJ. It was, as always, a nice treat to see Richard Brake on the screen.I was genuinely entertained by ""Barbarian"", and it is a movie that I warmly recommend you sit down and watch if you enjoy horror movies.My rating of ""Barbarian"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",2022-11-14
"The first ten minutes showed promise and then it went down hill from there. The concept was believable but the delivery was disappointing. Would have expected better given the cast. I am still in search of a modern day, well-delivered scare that does more than present blood and guts. They just do not make them like they used to. We need something that makes you need to turn the lights on and watch with someone. This one was easily viewed by a little old lady, watching alone in the dark. I also wanted to see what was worse in the neighborhood because the old man was not a threat. Left me hanging.",2022-10-29

I'm sorry, you have known this potentially serial killer man who is in your Airbnb for ten minutes...now we are going back to save his life in a dark underground tunnel??

The way they shoot in the dark is quite ok in term of making a film. There are some potential plot in there but again, since everything based on stupidity from the 0 mins till the movie end, I dont think anyone can make this movie any better.

"I had been warned not to read anything about this film before watching it and I am definitely glad that I made that move. I went into it not knowing what the hell it was going to be about, apart from a woman checking into an air B&B and it not being what it seems.That left me with fresh eyes to be taken on this roller coaster ride of a horror film.I have to say that I avidly enjoyed it. It kept me glued to the screen.I usually pop a film on when I am doing something else, but with Barbarian I put everything done just to get completely engrossed in the film.I really don't want to say anything about the plot as I don't want to spoil it for others.The acting is great, the production values are terrific. This is definitely one edgy horror film that I will be recommending to all my friends.So again, don't read anything about the plot and just sit down for the ride.",2022-11-05
"Using destroyed Detroit as a the setting alone gets this movie 4/10 - brilliant, original idea. Double that for an 8/10 total for the excellent use of a failed city's pathologies to advance an unpredictable plot.The touches of humor were well done, but one character's cartoonish interest in measuring square footage detracted from the movie's otherwise considerable power.The skeptical police were a little too much so, especially because there were two nice, locked, and undamaged cars on front of the house.But really this is a fun movie to watch. I'm just putting in some critiques to hit the minimum character limit.",2022-09-25
"Yes, there was tension, some scares, black humor, and horrid looking characters, but for me it all didn't come together in the sense of a complete film. The acting of Georgina Campbell, Bill Skarsgard, and Justin Long was pretty fair, but nothing to write home about. They did a serviceable job with the material they had. Perhaps the directing by Zach Cregger was only serviceable as well.I had the feeling that there were some attempts to tell ""lessons"" and ""messages"" being about men sexually abusing women and ignoring big red flags , but nothing so powerful as the lessons deserved.In my opinion, the 2 or 3 stories in this movie could have been better told in a couple of different movies with more focus and fewer plot holes that you could drive a giant truck through.",2022-10-27
"A must see, creepy and you know how it goes with a new horror flick on streaming services. This is a weird one to review.It built up slowly to go to a point were suddenly the movie fades to black and a whole new story starts. And in that story there's another story which for me never is explained so by now you get it. A strange flick that builts up slowly and even as a new story starts it do flows slowly into the first part.It's not that bad after all, and it do has it moments with even some nasty and on the edge of gory shots.I went into it blind and expected nothing at all and it worked out fine.Gore 1/5

"When ""Tess"" (a rather prone to over-acting Georgina Campbell) arrives at her airb'n'b she discovers that it is already occupied by ""Keith"" (Bill Skarsgård). Both are meant to be there - some dodgy booking admin - and so after a bit of a shaky start, and a bottle of red, they agree to share for the night. Next morning, on the hunt for some toilet tissue, she encounters a secret room in the basement that looks like it's been used for nefarious purposes. When her new friend comes home, he goes exploring and next thing, we discover a network of tunnels inhabited by... To be fair to auteur Zach Cregger, there is quite am impactful degree of claustrophobic horror to this but I am afraid I wasn't convinced - right from the start - with the plausibility of the whole thing. Whom, in their right mind, would discover what she does and then go off exploring, on their own, without taking some fairly elementary precautions? The drama and peril here is sort of forced upon us despite any natural alarm bells we might have saying ""I don't think so"". Anyway, it turns out that ""AJ"" (Justin Long) owns the house and when he turns up to find it still bestrewn with their luggage, he joins in the hunt in the tunnels and the pace hots up a little as escape becomes the imperative against a foe who makes ""Gollum"" look like Claudia Schiffer. It is quite a watchable affair, I did quite enjoy it, but I struggled with the realism of the scenarios and maybe just because I'm a scaredy cat, I wasn't ever really persuaded! Fun, though - and certainly at the better end of the recent releases in this often underwhelming genre.",2022-11-03
"I didn't know much going into this movie other than a woman vos to an air bnb. I had no expectations. The movie starts off just a little slow and the characters make some odd choices but it leads them down a dark path. It almost seems as though there are two parts to the movie. On a sense, there is but they're related and everything comes together in the second part and even more backstory is revealed.There are so many twists and turns in this movie that you can't really predict what's gonna happen next. It really is a wild ride that's fun and not your run of the mill horror movie. I don't understand the low ratings at all. Maybe some people can't appreciate new material that we haven't seen on the screen before. Usually Hollywood just shoves remakes out every week and people don't mind. This is not your typical scary movie. I don't know. But I feel as though it's definitely a solid horror movie that's entertaining, scary, and will remain a fan fave.My only regret is that I didn't see this in a theater and instead saw it from my bed. It's great at home but in a dark theater would add a whole other level to this movie. It's worth the cost of a ticket and I don't usually say that about anything.Don't listen to the low reviews. It's crazy if anyone rated this below a 6. Go see it. You'll enjoy it. I promise.",2022-10-26
"There is real talent on display in Barbarian - apparent in the lead actors, the commitment to the premise, the use of sound and visuals to build up the tension, and some really powerful moments. But ultimately the film disappoints because the creature that is at the lurking centre of the horror is ultimately so extreme and grotesque she loses the capacity to inspire fear but instead the result is disbelief and laughter. I loved the opening, the uneasy situation that Tess and Keith faced finding themselves booked in the same Airbnb, and the uncertainty around Keith and whether Tess is safe or not. There are some really cool and surprising changes in tone and dashes of humor throughout. But ultimately both my teenage daughter and I left shaking our heads not sure what we had just watched and the small group of friends sitting behind us in the theatre seemed to feel the same way.",2022-09-22
"First off, horror is my jam. I've seen hundreds of movies in this genre and it takes a lot for me to like a horror movie. Barbarian literally had one of the best opening scenes and plot ideas to come out of a horror movie in a long time. (Kind of the way I felt about Jeepers Creepers, but that also had a disappointing unrealistic ending). Skarsgard and Long did not disappoint and the main actress who played Tessa was great.However, as soon as the second half of the movie started, it did a quick downward spiral. They could have went so many other places with this movie. You have the lead character Tessa, who is portrayed as an extremely strong character and very aware of her surroundings to the point she wouldn't even drink the tea that was made for her in the beginning. She looks out for herself. Yet she finds herself in this nightmare of a reality later on in the tunnel, escapes and wants to go back to save someone she doesn't even know? No one in their right mind would go back to save a complete stranger after witnessing whatever tf that was. Those are just facts.They didn't go into the backstory enough either, unfortunately and very little was told of Frank and who The Mother was. Why did she come out at night? Cause she was inbred and used to the dark life in the tunnel? We don't know, we can only guess.Then Tessa is supposed to survive a fall off of the top of a watchtower and so does The Mother?What started off as such an amazing and realistic plot, turned into an unbelievable story of a mole family living way down in the basement instead of just wanting to live in the house itself (for whatever reason) and mother grown adults.Like I said, they could have done sooooo many other things with this movie, but they chose this route instead. While yes, inbreeding can be scary and creepy, this one just didn't make all that much sense. Why make her want to yearn for a baby? Where did the mattress and the bucket come from? Why was there a video camera in there? I still have so many questions.Normally I don't care to know the ""how's"" or ""why's"" of a movie, but because this one had so much potential and just didn't live up to where I thought it was going... I had to make a review.Hoping someone in the near future can take a plot similar to this one and do something amazing with it.Enjoy it for the few jumps and minor scares, and to watch the chemistry between Tessa and Keith (who should have had way more screen time), but that's about it.",2023-01-21
"I quite liked this one. I can already tell that people are going to hate on it because it doesn't quite adhere to your classic horror format that people will probably be expecting.While it is full of tension and some legit creepiness, it also doesn't take itself too seriously and has a light hearted feel in moments. Let's be real, if you see Justin Long in the cast I wouldn't go into it expecting anything else. I personally thought it had a nice balance between the two. I do wish there were some more creepy elements brought into the tunnels and some more discoveries within. I thought it looked really nice with some cool shots and the acting was solid across the board as well.If you're looking for a semi spooky movie with an underlying air of light heartedness with an intriguing plot that keeps you engaged, I would recommend.",2023-01-13
The best 20th century studios movie in Disney history. Bill skarsgard and the other people did a remarkable job in this movie. It was it and the ring mixed together. The woman who kidnapped the three people was so like pennywise who lived in a house down in Detroit Michigan . Justin long was so awesome in the movie . But I almost thought his character was gonna live but the mama woman had to take him out . The main character who Survived got the villain really well . I hope to see this on Disney plus or Hulu cause I think this movie will be the next Halloween movie for adults and teens .Barbarian rules Halloween.,2022-10-18
"I've never heard about this movie until I saw it on Disney Plus. I watched it with low expectations.In Barbarian, a woman rents an Airbnb house in Detroit and finds out that it is double booked by another stranger. She then decides to stay with the stranger anyway, and she slowly begins to experience strange things in the house.Barbarian is a well-paced, scary and highly entertaining movie that kept me on the edge of my seat until the end of the film. The story can be at times unpredictable too. The movie is divided into two parts, and I was satisfied with how they put it together. The acting of the cast is perfect. The ""monster"" really did creep and scare the heck out of me. The cinematography looks creative as well. I just didn't like the ending much.It is definitely one of the best 2022 movies I've seen, and I recommend it.",2023-01-04

"The movie creates a solid foundation as each character had a solid introduction, and you can feel relate to their situations. There is some questionable decisions done by the the characters which may make your eyes role a little bit, but it is for the sake of creating those horror scenes. And, Oh boi! Those horror scenes have a nice payoff. The movie does a good job on creating a tense atmosphere, and they just don't relay on cheap jump scares. Soundtrack is on point. The movie could have been better if they had developed the story better at the end, but the movie's end feels as the writers run out of time.",2022-10-16

"Going into this movie blind did some massive favours on my enjoyment for the first third of the film. But once the pace changes with THAT character, it all felt a little stale from there. There are some incredible rug pull moments, as well as incredibly tense and disturbing scenes, but the main character doesn't receive nearly enough character development. Plus the police in this film are infuriatingly stupid for the sake of the plot. I understand characters have to make dumb decisions (it's a horror movie after all) but certain choices, along with the inclusion of cheap sound effects to add to a few jump scares, made me eyeroll. A strong point to end on is that the performances are stellar.",2022-11-08

"Let's see what barbarian means: ""Barbarians symbolize the unillumined, uncultivated thoughts of man. They judge by man's law because they do not understand spiritual law. They are foreign to Spirit, and are totally lacking in true Christian love and refinement.""The movie from the begin to the end shows this toxic masculinity, the willing of men to prove a women wrong, their ego and over confidence can lead to difficult situation and causes self destruction. There are many red flags that the male characters of the movie shows which are offensive and downright cruel the female characters (won't go to the details and ruin it for you).As a standalone horror movie, Barbarian is one of the best in recent times. The metaphysical representation of male dominance and the toxicity is icing on the cake.",2022-10-27
"I went into this movie as every person should when going to see this movie, and that is without any knowledge of it whatsoever. Glad I did. The overall concept of a misunderstanding between an Airbnb rental with a grueling twist within the house is definitely a treat for horror fans who have been tired of seeing the same old thing the last couple of years. During this movie I got a lot of vibes from many different movies, some of those include As above so Below, Don't breathe, and even a bit of Hills have Eyes. I definitely say it's something we needed in the horror genre as it was starting to become stale. Now I won't say that this is a perfect SCARY movie or even a fantastic one at that, however it is definitely a fun and enjoyable watch and would recommend to anyone, especially if you're just starting out in the genre!",2022-09-16
"I like the first half of the film. It was actually great! Keith (Bill Skarsgard) got me so good thinking he's gonna do something crazy to Tess (Georgina Campbell), who rented a house in an abandoned neighborhood.The good thing of not seeing the trailer before watching the film is that, you don't have any idea at all what's gonna happen next.The story was so tricky. Good, especially the first half. Suspense, until the second half started. It got funny. Aside from Aj (Justin Long), who also rented the same house, the story was not thrilling anymore but we all know Justin Long is a good actor.The mother was scary. Creepy. Gave me a jump scare on her first appearance. Then, the story happened. I didn't expect the ending would be like that.All in all, it was an okay film!",2022-10-27
"After all the word of mouth, I had to see this movie. Not that most reviews I heard, convinced me of its greatness. But I always need to see things for myself, to form my opinion. And I neither regret nor feel glad I did. It was entertaining, but also pointless and ridiculous. Like I always do in recent horror movies, I thought the shock values were laughable. And the only time I jumped, was when I mistook Skarsgård for the creature itself. Regardless of the script and title emphasizing on that aspect of the story, the metoo thing was strangely irrelevant. And you end up not believing a word of it, and wishing they went deeper into the serial killer's backstory instead. The heroine is great, but Justin Long's character make most of the movie. And I loved the ambiguities regarding his character's intentions. The inbred woman though, was over the top. And I thought the director's way of trying to humanize her, and reach to the audience's empathy, showing her eyes in various shots, and sensibility towards her « babies », didn't work. So I couldn't wait for Tess to pull the trigger on her. Also the cheery song at the end, is something too overdone to be unexpected... It was a good idea, but the execution was lackluster and the movie barely touched on its subjects, so to speak. And the first half is very cringeworthy, with characters doing exactly everything you shouldn't do in a horror movie...",2023-09-30
This is not a bad movie. I didn't find it especially scary but there are some dark themes that are pretty disturbing.Pros - The acting is sound and there's some nicely written characters. Couple of protagonists you'll really like and care about and a couple of other characters you'll quite deliberately immensely dislike.There's some enjoyable twists.Cons - there's some seriously questionable decisions made and the main antagonist which feel a little tropey. The ending might be a little divisive.I can't see this movie tearing the box office apart but I think it'll garner quite a cult following. I enjoyed it.,2022-10-31

Thanks to some really clever editing choices, Characters Decisions, it manages to be truly scary and tense, funny and disturbing all at once. This movie was basically made for me. 10/10 Big regret I didn't see at In the theater.One thing I didn't understand is were they intentionally double booked in the airbnb?

God.... Is someone really investing in these kind of garbage movies? How do they make money with this? ......If you have an iq above 70, do not watch this.

"Justin Long appears in yet another horror film. A breast-feeding video is shown on an old TV. Two people book the same B & B at the same time sans any explanation. That's what you get with 2022's Barbarian. The critics have spoken (and spoken kindly) but I digress. I think the whole thing is a touch overrated. Just saying.So yeah, Barbarian is a pic full of placed red herrings, a sort of broken-down, blood-stained heap if you will. Directed by rookie Zach Cregger, Barbarian could have gone the straight and narrow as a reverse, home invasion thriller. Bully for that. The flick goes off on tangents and when good old Long shows up (about thirty minutes in), Barbarian actually turns into noir, the kind of noir that ends with well, loose ends.Now would I give Barbarian a favorable rating? I can't because it doesn't know what it wants to be nor does it really have a suitable coda. And do the actors give sort of rote performances in a movie that feels like an overtaxed guessing game? Sadly yes. If I wanted to watch a complex version of The Descent and/or Don't Breathe (with that bleak Detroit setting) I would do so at my own leisure. There's a mixing of genres here that's not scary, not judicious, and the film's lone flashback is almost like filler compared to everything that came before it.Barbarian stars Georgina Campbell, Bill Skarsgard, and Justin Long (mentioned earlier). They're in a vehicle about a young woman who rents a home only to be terrorized by a demonized creature with severe mommy issues (ugh). In truth, Barbarian thinks it's too clever for its own good. It's as if its early Hitchcockian tendencies are able to make up for the acute lack of pacing. Sorry but no. It's too non-""primitive"" for that. Natch.",2022-10-26

It was just rubbish, full of cliches, characters came and went and it felt like a poor excuse for a film, definitely shouldn't be rated 18!Maybe the main actress was ok but why did the first guy just get squished?! No follow up and no back story. The other characters were also pointless so I'm still struggling with the high score? The creature was not related to anything, why was that TV clip playing? What was that dirty bed for, the cages and so many other unanswered questions? Nonsense.",2023-08-03
"The one thing I give this movie credit for is being unique and original. It's a interesting take on something we see in the news all the time. The weird old guy with women and his basement dungeon, getting them pregnant, keeping them like pets somewhere in the basement. They just do an interesting twist on that at a few clever ideas and you get a really weird outcome. But I think these reviews of 7.6 and stuff like that are a little way over inflated. It should be more like a average or slightly above average movie like what I would say is like a six. And I have to find something to fill up 40 more characters blah blah blah.",2022-09-18
"Great cast and decent direction, but the story never rises above standard tension and that's only because of lightning and sound. The characters are undeveloped, the writing first draft. There was a lot of intentional fodder from the Midwest, Detroit and metoo# that only served to distract from the poor writing, plot character development, and production value. Would not see again, did not leave me questioning anything but my lost time. Horror snobs will not enjoy, it is not good enough to make fun of, there is not sufficient gore. I was left with asking myself: Where are all of the corpses?!?",2022-09-16
"So the first thing anyone should do before spending hard earned money on a film is check the credits. Who wrote, directed, acted in and how much the film cost to make etc.This will let you know whether you should spend your money or not. Your first clue, this is a big one, the writer and the director are the same person. Usually, this is not a good thing, either person paying himself twice, or three times, or they just could not get anyone else to do it.Once you see this ho directly to the budget, if it is not much chances are it just an iPhone movie as I like to call them. Next, look at cast, is there main players and do you see the writer/director also has a roll. This is the final dagger.You know there much wrong when they are writer, director, and actor. At this point you should be saying Uh, let's go for a hike instead.But if you have free tickets or have couple hours to kill then go for it.Every once in awhile you can be pleasantly surprised.There are allot of holes and goofs here but it is tense in some areas and in the end you will enjoy most of it.The ending is well, you will see.It does not warrant high marks being given.

"I watched this last night cold (without knowing anything about the move or reading any reviews). I gave it four stars for the two lead characters Campbell and Skarsgard. On the fence about Justin Long, he always seems to overact, and plays the same note in everything I see him in. Aside from that, this movie defies any logic and is therefore hard for a rational adult to buy into. Let's go down the list, as so many others have:
1. Tess does not vet the rental before arriving
2. Tess does not notice the abysmal neighborhood before she goes inside the first night.3. Tess decides to bunk with a complete stranger.4. After noticing the abysmal neighborhood the next morning, she goes back to the rental to stay another night.5. This clean, well-maintained rental would not exist in the abysmal neighborhood. Squatters/homeless would have trashed the place when it sits empty.6. Cops don't act like these Detroit cops when an upset woman runs up to them telling them what Tess did.7. Why is ""mother"" a superhuman? She has lived in a dark cellar most of her life, only coming out at night to terrorize people.8. How did ""father"" create such an elaborate underground living area? Complete with wiring? Not sure about plumbing.9. Didn't the management company notice the utilities were a little high for an AirBnB?10. What did the ""Father"" and ""Mother"" eat? How did they get out to buy groceries?11. Why didn't the ""Father"" just keep his house? Why would he sell it and then go live in the basement?12. Where to start with the final scene, Tess would not be able to get up and walk away after that fall. ""Mother"" would not jump after Tess. Etc. Etc.Also, the metoo plotline with Justin Long was not well integrated. I am thinking this thread was put in to elaborate on what kind of a person he was, but somehow it seemed like it belonged in another movie. It took you out of the main storyline, and it was hard to get back into the dark theme of the flick once you left it.I could go on and on, there are so many problems with the story, but most of them are covered in other reviews.

"I'm usually a big fan of not revealing too much in the trailer but talk about misleading... by the trailer, I assumed Tess (and maybe Keith, if he wasn't revealed to be the actual bad guy) would be going up against psychos luring in victims via online bookings. A whole block of underground tunnels, maybe the whole neighborhood was just an urban version of the Hills Have Eyes or a grittier, updated take on People Under the Stairs... the whole first act was a brilliant setup that just failed to follow through on what could have been an amazing fight for survival against the ""barbarian"", which is what the title suggested. The homeless man said it himself, ""she's not the worst thing down there."" But it was just a crazy inbred lady and a geriatric old has-been of a serial killer, who barely had any buildup before he was unceremoniously dispatched. And then it just ends, and ridiculously at that. It didn't even feel like ninety minutes, it all happened so quickly. It felt like it needed at least another half hour for buildup or backstory or a reveal of whatever else was lurking under an entire residential block of abandoned houses, but no. Just a disappointing ending of what should have been a better release. At my showing, people were laughing as the credits rolled and not in a good way. I gave it five stars just because the first half had good acting, good arc building, and so much potential, wasted though it was.",2022-09-11
"A woman headed for a job interview turns up to find her rented pad already occupied by a stranger. And not just him ...The first half of this movie is completely engaging, like a superior episode of the Twilight Zone with top production values. The direction, editing and script are nice and crisp, resulting in good performances, and the spare and eerie score creates a nice unease. There is one misjudgement in an early jump scare, but that's just a blip in quality.Then we switch to a new story - Pulp Fiction-style, in my view - and the suspicion grows that we really have sunk deep into that '50s Zone, where random, ordinary lives fall prey to some unnameable weirdness, without a real origin story. Fear not! The writers do pull it round, but in the most preposterous, literal-minded way, converting a limited story into some daft virtue horror that fails to overcome its tongue-in-cheek loss of nerve.The most original thing about this is the use of the Detroit neighbourhood in all its grim dereliction. The paranoid claustrophobia is truly creepy, turning up the dial on all those media images by which the rest of the world has come to know the city. But that just emphasizes the fact that something declared war on America a long time ago - and nobody fought back. Now that is a theme horrorists want explored!Overall: Promising start, silly ending.",2022-10-27

the double booking of an Airbnb,, and that Skarsgard was one of the two people. That's all I knew about the movie.Well,, it DID NOT go the way I thought it was going to! Not at all.All I can say is that when you find a hidden door,, never go into it,,,Georgina Campbell,, where have you been? I look forward to seeing you in more!Skarsgard is an ever-rising talent that I expect to see great things out of for years to come (what a talented family of actors).Also,, is Richard Brake not always typecast as the creepiest of creepy creepers? I mean, he's very good at it,, but he's done normal roles. Right?Justin Long plays his part well also.So, if you like horror suspense and want to also be shocked,, this is one to watch.I'd give it a 6.5 rating overall.",2022-12-13
"Absolutely LOVE this film.There is nothing that pleases me more than a movie I can't predict. So many these days that you can more or less tell where each act is going.Firstly the direction is brilliant. There's real character with the movement of the camera, and it really accentuates each shot. Sometimes certain details are highlighted by a zoom, focus or pan. Other times they happen subtlety in the background. The score by Anna Drubich was understated and perfectly suited.The performances are excellent bar none. We all know Justin Long can always deliver, and Bill Skarsgard has more than proven his ability, but Georgina Campbell was enthralling and a protagonist I want to watch more of! Huge props as well to Matthew Patrick Davis whose physical performance was full of emotion despite the extremely minimalistic dialogue.The story was just awesome. I loved the tonal shifts that accompanied each storyline. Some people complain about the dramatic changes, and if you're one of these people please stick to 90-minute action or horror movies that do nothing to surprise you but jump scares.The jarring juxtaposition really boosted my enjoyment.This is a brilliant, scary, gruesome, hilarious film and I strongly recommend it. Can't wait to see more movies with Zach Cregger at the helm.",2023-02-07
"Well, it's not what I was expecting. Some of it was ok. Some of it wasn't.A girl (Tess) books a stay in a rental only to arrive and find the location double booked. She and the man currently occupying the home (Keith), compromise where they can both stay and work things out the following day. The following day Tess ends up locking herself in the basement and comes across a suspicious hidden room. Keith wants to see it for himself and goes even farther to reveal a network of tunnels, rooms and something lurking in the darkness.I went into this blind. I'd not seen any trailers or read anything other than a vague description but I had seen the poster. The film isn't bad and is cleverly misleading to anyone who thinks they know where the story is leading. I personally think that it lacked detail but I understand that fear of the unknown works for a lot of people. While I think it is a bit overrated, I thought it was a decent watch. It seems like a film that will reveal itself a little more each time you watch it. I wouldn't mind recommending it.",2022-10-26
"I never thought characters in a movie can be that brain dead, i mean some stupid choices have to be made by characters to make the movie happen, But brainless idiot of characters in this movie are beyond anything i have seen. I love horror movies i watch them almost every night, so i know that horror element that makes a movie good spooky experience.Like for example the third character AJ is so brain dead that at apoint where he is running from the monster and reaches an open door, but that idiot does not enter in it right away, he waits for the monster and sees off, then he enters, Like WTF.And police officers are blind probably in this movie, like they did not see two big cars in perfectly great condition parked in a burnt down neighborhood.Honest to god, i only watched this movie because of bill skarsgard because he is one of the best actors in the industry.( Also his character seems to be the only character with some amount of brain cell, but unfortunately he gets killed very early in the movie)Don't Watch this movie, it will make you angry, whoever wrote this movie is a brain dead idiot who should never ever write a movie.",2022-11-01
There are some stories we build from an ending and this is one such movie. The writers had decided their aim was to make the viewers sympathize and they were able to do that to a large extent but we who were expecting a solid thriller were kind of disappointed. It was working as a great thriller and when it changes it's tone in the end it felt difficult to accept. While it was not a need ending the sudden change made it difficult to rate this as one of the best thrillers. IMDb now says i have to write more words. May be they want to reduce the number of people who wants to write reviews and have increased the word limit.,2022-12-22
"Being a horror fan I've watched a LOT of horror movies, more than a few of them multiple times, and I honestly thought I'd seen it all; but Barbarian genuinely scared me.I went into this having watched the trailer *once*, and I felt like it would be the usual boring fare, and I felt this way right up until the first quarter of the movie.There's not a lot that I have to say here except for how thoroughly impressed and surprised I am. The scares were awesome, the premise wasn't unique but excellent in its implementation, and the cinematography really stole the show. You don't often get to watch a movie tie in a constant feeling of dread with a few choice scares so deftly.I can't say any more without going into spoiler territory, and trust me: the less you know about this movie before you go into it the better.You might see a lot of negative reviews and yours might be one of them, but that's the thing: Barbarian is nothing if not polarizing and that's a better badge of honor of a horror movie than receiving a 5/10 by everyone that watched it.",2022-10-28
"Made a big Saturday night out of watching this with a group of people who were all excited to see it. Everyone was captivated until we first saw the antagonist of the film, after which we couldn't help busting out laughing at the ludicrousness that was unfolding on screen. I literally had to come back to IMDB to make sure I hadn't missed that this was a dark comedy. Why does this have such high ratings? People want so badly to be ""artsy"" and pretend they like something different because it's the ""cool"" thing to do that a terrible movie will be lauded. Is it worth the watch? Sure, but only for the laughs.",2022-10-30
"The movie is over hyped nothing is there.There is some thrilling scene in the movie some scenes have no logic we need to assian it ourselves
Why the movie have this much ratings first and metrics score is also high.People think having high rating the movie is awesome but the movie is completed average
It's just a thriller movie
Two different part are merged together I think something missing on the movie
I watch the movie with high rating but not worth it
I hope people realise slow after watching the movie
I don't the mindset of guys who rated high on the movie what else they see different in the movie to go for high rating.",2022-11-08
"One day I randomly find this movie on Disney+, so I decided to watch it out but seriously this movie wasted my time, it is not at all scary.. ending was also very below average, boring, don't know how makers of movies like ring, it, made such a trash... personally I found it pathetic, this movie is like a torture to ur mind.. if u love to spoil ur day then this movie is for u... this movie is best for it... i don't know who how in today's time someone love this kind of movie when we all experienced masterpieces in this genre... conjuring series, it series, lights out, ring, all these are masterpieces.... may be someone who haven't watched these movies may find it amazing horror movie but for those who already watched above mentioned movie will not take it and found a trash like me.",2023-01-04
"I had heard good things about this film, and I love creepy horror so couldn't wait to watch this.What starts out as a seemingly innocent and unfortunate situation between two strangers, could have easily turned into the perfect romance film, however soon turns a hard left turn into a completely new and terrifying direction.There is an eery level of tension from the get go which adds to the suspense throughout.It's strange seeing Bill Skarsgård in any character other than Pennywise but this nice guy character suits him too.Georgina Campbell's Tess does well to avoid the horror cliches at first but quickly throws that all out the window as she descends a dark stairway into a secret tunnel system in the basement without even thinking to alert the police...
Justin Long's AJ provides some comic relief at first before his storyline soon ends up just as horrific as the others.This film is thrilling and nerve-racking right up to its climax. The only bad part about it is now I have to reconsider ever staying in an AirBnB.",2022-12-30
"With all of the nonsense released these days its so refreshing to watch something that actually checks off all the boxes in the relevant genre. This had it all: Creepy, suspense, twists, jump scares, gore, disturbance, solid characters, very believable acting and so on.'Darrie' does so well at playing the 'jerk you dont like, but get sad at their tribulations'. This is truly 'darrie' from jeepers if he had survived and became a bigger jerk.The young lady 'tess' (georgina campbell) is a gem! Pure talent on display here, i hope this really propels her career! BIll skarsgard's talent is a full force as usual in this along with all the other characters, even though some short lived :( .I REALLLY hope there is a sequel to this with 'tess' at the forefront!Go see it!!! Now,, do it! Why are you still sitting there?!",2022-09-25
"A young woman shows up at a remote Detroit AirBnB, only to discover that someone else has been double booked for the same house. As they get over the initial awkwardness of the situation, they begin to discover that they aren't quite alone in this house.What I liked about the film is that the pacing is good, it doesn't feel rushed and instead eases you into the storyline and characters. The woman getting to the BnB and getting to know her co-tenant, and from there the two discovering some unusual things in the house is very well done in my view. It gives everything time to sink in, yet at the same time without becoming slow.I didn't watch the trailer for this, and that probably helped with the unpredictability of some of the film's elements as just watching the story, you don't easily predict what is coming next, and the introduction of Justin Long's character wasn't something I could have foreseen.That being said, this is still a relatively classic horror film in what it delivers, however I enjoyed that instead of relying on jump scares, the film builds things up gradually and leans more on atmosphere to deliver chills. There were a few elements in the final act that I wasn't too keen on as maybe a couple of cliches crept in, but overall a nice solid and refreshing horror movie.",2022-12-19
"I'm not sure whether the trailer was cut to satisfy execs and producers or whether it was a genius act of misdirection - but either way Barbarian was nothing like the movie I had expected - and it was all the better for it.It takes some time to establish itself in the first instance but the payoff as the film moves into Acts 2 and 3 is fantastic.Barbarian is a stylishly shot and incredibly well acted movie. Justin Long gives a particularly good performance - but the entire cast are on great form.While some elements are a little predictable, these are absolutely deliberate and create space for a few moments of welcome and well-timed comic relief which offset some of the very pointed (and excellently delivered) social commentary.The editing is outstanding. With the film effortlessly stepping out of tension and horror into scenes which give greater context to the story, and create tension in other ways. As well as giving relief from the damp labyrinth with scenes of bright, lush colour.Once it gathers momentum, Barbarian is like a run away minecart speeding into the darkness with sparks flying. Barbarian a film which has no intention of being subtle and doesn't need to be.",2022-09-13
"This movie starts off bad and ends up even worse. The general delayed scare tactic with dark hallways gets old quick and the acting as well.Based in a basement, not a Barbarian, these characters lack any sense of real fear in the way they are repeatedly incompetent to sense danger.Matthew's role as Mother only because of his freakish height is about the scariest thing in the movie, besides the gross scenes of breast feeding and bottle feeding adults. Just how these actors didn't crack up laughing at the director is the real talent.Wait for it on Netflix or YouTube for free. Not worth a movie ticket.",2022-09-11
"This movie should be really good, but the pacing is off, as is the timeline. The first act of the film is awesome. It's tense, scary, and all that good stuff. A great set-up leaving us wondering who the bad guy really is. After the first death, the screen goes to black and reopens on Justin Long cruising down the 5 in CA. Insert 20+ minutes getting his backstory. It is a major interruption to the flow and ambiance. We get it, he's a jerk, but just show that amid the scary stuff, or make it MUCH quicker.My other issue is the timeline. The flashback happens in either '80 or '84 as the radio discusses Reagan's election. The killer is supposed to be the product of the man and incest with his own descendants. Even if the mutant killer is 15 years old (she looks 100), how could he have produced a bloodline long enough to create such a mutated person? I don't know, it just didn't add up for me. Maybe it would have if I hadn't been so disassociated by that point in the story.One other point, the police officers. Was this just a disrespectful criticism of police, or does the writer really think that two cops would leave a woman in that condition alone with no help?Overall it was a disappointment. I love Justin Long and Bill Skarsgard, so I wanted to love it. The concept was good, the execution was not.",2022-11-12
"I can't believe the reviews for this were that good. It was literally a waste of time. The movie was less than mediocre for a horror movie. I love horror movies but this was horrible. From all the great reviews I thought it was going to be an epic movie for horror but it was a disappointment. I wouldn't be surprised if this was movie bombed but the other way where they say it's good. It was a boring movie and trust me, from a horror movie lover, it's not good at all. Don't waste your money and wait until it's out on one of the streaming services. The plot was boring and everyone was laughing at the ""scary"" parts of the movie like another review said. Don't waste your money, it's bad.",2022-09-18
"What can I say? This movie starts out great, it keeps you guessing and we really liked the beginning to the second ""act"" of this film, it was like watching another episode or another movie! But like other reviewers have said, this is where the good ends and the ridiculousness begins. Why is the mutant inbred always portrayed as having superhuman strength, enough to bring down grown men and prize their eyeballs out of their skulls, ripping heads in half, mutilating grown men? Be real please, don't insult our intelligence. It gets worse when there's a p.o.s rapist character who gets an easy out by blowing his own brains out, big whoop. My partner said he should have gotten tortured and mutilated for what he had done. The ending is super disappointing. Three quarters of the way in I was finding my mind wandering, it didn't hold my attention the way it should have done. There could have been a great film in there somewhere but yeah, back to the drawing board with this one folks! If you take it for what it is, a silly, gory horror with no real plot that thinks it's 3 different films then you might enjoy it...",2023-02-15
"I love act 1. I think that it literally shaped a successful atmosphere of tension between two strangers, and the creepy noise happened at midnight, dark and silent room without any person scenes, detail-oriented acting of two actors which let audiences suspect the man is bad or not, all of these can truly excite my nerves. But then the man I supposed to be one of protagonists was killed suddenly halfway, and saw a huge human-like creature, I disappointed again. After act 1, logical issues were explosive growth and plot became boring.Another shining idea of this movie is the concept of creature's birth. That disgusting old guy shouldn't die so easily. May be assume that women were murdered gather grudges and stuck in that dark and horrible basement thus turns barbarian to a supernatural horror movie.",2022-12-23
"First off, I would recommend to go into this movie knowing as little as possible. Even if you have watched the trailer (which fortunately doesn't give away any of the bigger plot points), it is truly impossible to guess where the movie goes next. It actively avoids all of the usual horror movie cliches and relies more on atmosphere and situational horror rather than jump scares.With that said, this movie is completely and utterly bonkers. It is bats**t crazy, in a very good way. The acting is great and the story, even though it jumps a bit back and forth both time wise and between characters, is nicely tied together at the end. A big recommendation from me if you like horror!",2022-11-05
"My title says it all. This movie doesn't deserve the high reviews. It started out awesome! I was so pumped. Overall it was lame and ended up not great. So dissatisfied. I can think of so many better more ground breaking horror. Did not live up to the hype. It was different and engaging until about half way through. After that it went off the rails. Old horror with terrible effects is better. If you like smart horror steer clear. I love movies like The witch, old stuff and shows like Netflix's the haunting of hill house. If you like smart real terror this movie is not for you. It was a real let down :(Edited to add that I picked up the underlying moral story of what we deal with as women etc. Still didn't make up for how terrible the movie ended up being.",2022-10-28
"Super fun movie. Didn't ever get slow or boring. Loved everything about it but I'm biased I love horrors. Sometimes it was a little predictable. I saw where it was headed early. But that didn't take away from the fun of it all. I especially loved Tess. So many times I was like ""finally"" a movie where someone was like ""nope"". Not going in there. Lmao. But yea I loved it.If you want a good scary movie and are willing to suspend a few beliefs and ignore some physics that aren't quite possible in real life, and just enjoy it for what it is you will like this movie too. Pretty scary in a couple scenes.",2022-10-29
"It's a shame to say that Barbarian mostly fizzles its landing, biting off much more than it can chew. A third act flashback detonates the film's perspective yet again, this time with an 80s flashback of a mysterious stalker (Richard Brake) that aims to add color to our surprising villains, but it mostly just siphons gas from a running tank: Once Barbarian's grotesque adversaries are fully revealed, the mystique and atmosphere buckle into less-effective splatstick. It's a bloody denouement that tumbles through all of its disparate pieces as characters, monsters, and themes all collide in an underwhelming jumble. It barely works, but it's hard to truly care about the missteps when the journey is so satisfyingly grisly and wild.",2022-10-26
"I'm a huge fan of horror. And any true fan if horror knows there is rarely if ever a 10-star, yet alone an 8. Horror fans would not give this such low ratings. Horror, too, does not need to have a deep complicated every dot connected literary plot / story arc. It's no silence of the lambs or alien but it's no cheep scream or I know what you did last summer (which were not that great but still popular for a reason). I saw this without hearing opinions or seeing a trailer and I was pleasantly surprised. More than once it had me and my friends screaming out-loud followed by hilarious laughter. There were some unexpected things amidst some of the classic ""you're stupid"" horror victim tropes. From all of us who appreciate a good scare without it being a bad movie and without the need to compare it to high art cinema, thank you. And for those who think it might be an exaggeration, I've been to that neighborhood the film takes place in... and it is suuuuuper creepy like that and not an exaggeration.",2023-02-12
"I don't recommend this to anyone. The second half is the grossest thing I've seen since I attempted to watch Human Centipede 2. I'm a horror fanatic and nothing fazes me. Not even the Saw anthology. I've seen plenty of gore films and videos and have attended autopsies. But this took the cake. Yes, I threw up. Not because it's scary, because it's the grossest movie I've ever seen. I was in shock all night and I didn't know how to move until my stomach forced me to.Shield yourself, shield your children. Shield your loved ones. Shield your gag reflex.If you want to see it but want to know what I'm talking about, read halfway through the plot on Wikipedia. I sure wish I did.I'd never want to come across the writer. I'm afraid of what goes on in that brain.",2022-10-26
"Could it have been better? Yeah, for sure. Could it have been worse? HELL YEAH! Honestly, though, with Bill Skaarsgard here I was down to watch it regardless.All that being said, it's a pretty solid movie, I guess? I mean, we could have got a bit more backstory on the monster, like was she his kid? Grandkid? Great grandkid? Was she the only one the apparently-homeless guy saw? Or had he seen previous generations?Anyway, it's still a pretty good movie for all that it lacks. It kept me most;y engrossed, more because I was trying to figure out wtf was going on and trying to follow the story after those two out-of-nowhere jump cuts. And yeah that ending kinda felt flat, like they didn't really know HOW to end it so they just kinda...ended it?",2023-02-25
"In Barbarian, I praised the story, storytelling, new performances of the cast, creepy and tense atmosphere, jumpscares, soundtrack, violence and brutality (even if it was not so much), direction, screenplay, cinematography, pacing, and the new ideas that the movie featured.But what I did not like is that I expected the story to be deeper and has new themes to be dealt with (especially that the movie received largely positive reviews). Also, I wished that the movie had more gore and violence, but unfortunately, it didn't.But these flaws will not make me say that I didn't like Barbarian. On the contrary, I liked it and wish that they expand the story more in the future if there are sequels or follow ups. That is why when it comes to the score, I give Barbarian 8 out of 10.",2022-11-06
"Barbarian is a solid small scale horror movie. It delivers some good scares, has good dialog, and a pretty good ''monster'' visually speaking. That said it suffers from some pacing issues and feeling a tiny bit too bloated and disjointed.Visuals and directing first off where really good. Love the sliding pan shots they used here, and in general lots of creative angles and ways of directing a scene. It makes it feel a little more fresh. That said, it didn't always work for me, particularly the wide angle scene with AJ felt funny. The serial killer segment was great too.That said, story wise I thought it was really solid for the first half. But after that it tends to become a bit iffy, AJ comes in and generates a bit more comedic relief at times but doesn't work that well later on, his story is pretty good though, even though it's quite blunt. The entire back in time segment felt really cool, visually.. but for the story it ended up doing very little. I'd honestly would've cut the entire thing, because eventually it leads to quite the underwhelming conclusion.Scariness/gore/VFX first of the make-up work is good and the small bit of gore there is is decent. Though this movie is very low on gore and mostly shows very little as well. Scariness, it's fine. But Keith was the scariest of them all, the movie peaked there lol. The monster is fine, but feels like something I've seen before. It reminded me of games like Amnesia. I wished the movie stayed a bit more in the creepy/paranormal area, the first half. That first scare is super creepy. I wish it lingered there a bit more. But it quickly turns into a traditional horror sequence.Story also goes off the rails towards the end with some laugh out loud moments. Some twists and turns here. Some of them very predictable and intentionally comedic, but others also unintentionally I think, or maybe not. Either way the whole finale of this movie is weird, plain weird. And throws realism a little out of the window. It wasn't tense though, which was a letdown.Acting is solid all around, all give good performances but none of them are particular standout. Skarsgard get's the highlight here I guess but it's not massive. Music was fine. The starting sound effects were really creepy and set quite a mood/bar but it never reached it.Overall it was pretty good. It slightly overstays it's welcome and ties the story up in a bit of a silly way.",2022-11-15
"First third of the movie was strong & headed in the right direction. Then complete character change within 30 minutes of his backstory that was unneeded since he died. They had an intriguing setup when they started the backstory of the ""villain"" but then just stopped explaining. The weird ""inbred"" lady running around boobs swinging with massive strength & wanting to bottle/booby feed people was really strange & made things awkward. How did she end up that way? How are they surviving? Where did the others go?Complete waste of a great concept.I am unsure of why this has such a high score on IMDb.",2022-09-18
"I don't know why people are complaining that this Film has Plotholes, every Film has Plotholes especially in the Horror Film Genre. Barbarian has a good pacing , Decent Acting and some Scary Suspense and a bit Black Humor. It tries something different and its worked very well. Justin Long has a Interesting Character and his Acting Perfomance was very decent, I liked him in another Horror Film Jeepers Creepers which is now more than 20 years ago. People shouldn't be so serious when watching a Horror Film and complain about every detail , Barbarian was a very fun Film with three likeable Characters (even when one , turned out not so much likeable in the end) , Good Acting , Unexpected Plot Twists some Scary Scenes and Black Humor, for me this was one of the Best Horror Films in 2022 , much better than Scream , Halloween Ends or Bodies Bodies Bodies, Well done.

"I kind of recommend it, I enjoyed it. It will gross some people out, it's kind of a horror, but in a weird and interesting way. It's a curve ball.A reviewer said to ""go in blind"" and even stop watching their review, until it had been seen, and ""don't watch the trailer!"" so, I did as recommended, and I'm pleased I did.It went somewhere I didn't foresee, and that will do.I dare any of you, even if it might not be your cup of tea (the genre), to go and see something a little bit different and, if you do, try to steer clear of trailers and a synopsis.I suppose the main thing to spoil is the journey, rather more than the destination.",2022-11-03
"I'm not sure what people are talking about but this is a horror movie and it's exactly what I thought it would be, just maybe more disturbing!! There are plot holes that cannot be explained. Must be something on the cutting room floor. As far as some claims of cinematography being good, what are you talking about. Most of this was shot in the dark!Extremely weak plot elements and while I want to care about the characters, I just want to scream at you for being so stupid.

"This is not a movie, oh no it's a mix of 3 stories tied around the house. The actual action scenes are like you are watching gameplay of Amnesia, Resident Evil and Outlast. The monster is super strong and you are stuck with a blinking flashlight while you have to find the way out and uncover mysteries on the way.Very predictable movie with solid time-proven origin story. If you want to make a movie, base it on something done before in movies or real life.The characters doesn't make any sense of course, but that's the charm of those cheap predictable movies. The AZ is the most realistic of them, secret dungeon under my house? Oh boy I gonna be rich, let me see how many square foot is my dungeon! In the most unrealistic sense the most realistic scene LMAO.Good ideas about AZ having a guilty conscience and doing bad things to save himself, tried to push his background story as character quality for his future actions.Other than this, 6/10.

"First 30 minutes intense and suspenseful, then a massive left turn into stupidity. The first third the characters seem real and actually make reasonable but debatable choices, the second 2/3's enter a comic actor and every ridiculous choice imaginable. It really is a waste of such a great beginning, then the acting went south and the story with it. By the end of course at least one character has to go into intense self examination while of course in mortal danger, because it's perfectly natural at least in Hollywood it seems to have a inner debate while someone is trying to kill you. By the end the performances and the story reached ludicrous speed, then mercifully the movie ended.",2022-11-17

I haven't been this annoyed by a movie going experience since Open Water (which also should have been left as a short)Some things I did like:
The Mother's costume and make up
And I also liked the pizza that I had while watching the movie at the theater.The Snickerdoodle cookies were good too but please get cookies while watching literally ANY other movie because this one isn't worth the price of the ticket and quite frankly I'm shocked it's made as much as it has at the time of writing this.

"Barbarian
Dir. Zach Cregger
Rating: 8/10Barbarian is a story about a young woman who books an Airbnb home. But when she arrives late at night, she discovers that the house is double booked and a strange man is already staying there. Against her better judgment, she decides to spend the evening but soon discovers that there's a lot more to fear than just an unexpected house guest.Barbarian is full of unpredictability. Just when you thought you knew where the film was going, it went the other way. Cregger clearly understood the anticipations of the audiences for him to create a twist that we never see coming, and it worked effectively. Barbarian is a product of a film that was made out of love for the horror genre. We have been getting great horror films this year, with X, Pearl (which I will publish a review tomorrow), and Black Phone, but Barbarian is unlike any of these films. The overall premise might not be as original as most of Hollywood's horror movies, but the execution and command to misdirect the audience make it a standout horror this year.The film is a roller-coaster experience you never see coming. The movie started out with an awkward situation, but the build-up was, in any way, claustrophobic and unapologetically entertaining. The charm of the film is how it continually wrongfoots the audience and delivers daring twist after twist. My issue with the movie is how the second and third acts felt misguided and unwarranted. Specifically, Justin Long's character was dragging and wobbly during the second half. I don't understand how his character gets 15 minutes of characterization but it was nonessential and very much unlikeable.Nonetheless, the film is a pure gift to horror fans, well-crafted, the touches of humor are on-point, and you can't spell Barbarian without Airbnb.",2022-10-30
"This movie overall seemed to fit the bill in many aspects but did also leave a few loose ends here and there. The cinematography was great!! The movie was beautifully shot, and the acting was tolerable and didn't leave me hating one specific actor. I thoroughly enjoyed the mix of thrills, terror and even laughs which were very entertaining. Justin Long was great, as were Bill Skarsgård and Georgina Campbell. I would have to make this a must see for all, especially in a theatre with great sound. It truly was a roller-coaster of a movie and didn't leave me bored at any time. The writers seriously hit the mark with the plot of this movie, not only that, but even a brilliant trailer will have the viewer seriously wondering what this movie is truly about.A few plot holes here and there can get a little annoying to many, but I didn't mind it with this movie one bit.I think if I ever stay in an Airbnb again, I will be searching the place after seeing this movie!!Go see it and you be the judge!!",2022-09-14
"If you're looking for a pulse-pounding, spine-chilling horror movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat, then look no further than this thrilling film. Without giving away any spoilers, I can tell you that the movie features an inbred monster that is truly terrifying and will have you jumping out of your seat in fear.The acting in this movie is top-notch, with each actor delivering a powerful and convincing performance that will draw you into the story and make you feel like you're right there in the midst of the terror. The cinematography is also impressive, with beautiful and eerie visuals that will leave a lasting impression on you long after the movie has ended.But what really sets this movie apart is its ability to deliver genuine scares without relying on cheap jump scares or gore. The tension builds gradually, and the fear is palpable as the inbred monster stalks its prey.Overall, this movie is a must-see for horror fans looking for a genuinely frightening and well-crafted scary movie. It's a testament to the genre and will have you screaming and jumping in your seat until the very end.",2023-05-02
"Really nice horror experience. Loved the first act, Skarsgård's character was really interesting and I was just guessing whether he's or he isn't the main villain, but I quickly realize that it would be very transparent and boring, so I was just curious about what will happen next. Loved the unpredictability of the movie, I was expecting absolutely everything in the first half and that first half is the best thing that happened to this movie. Without any spoilers, I'll just say that there are 3 stories and they merge into one at the end of the movie. And yes, my issue is the last act isn't as strong as the first. Loved the twist at the end of the first act, but later in the movie, yeah, it's still a lot of fun, but it just isn't that good like the first. But goddamn hell yeah this is a good-ass horror movie, watched it with my brother, and he also very liked it.",2022-11-01
"I will admit I am not a fan of horror/thriller movies. I just don't like movies that rely on scare to be good. Some people do and that's fine.That all being said, this movie was pretty suspenseful, mainly in the first half. There was a point in the movie, and you'll know, where it kind of takes a turn and gets a little silly. That's where it kind of was lacking. I was hoping they could just keep up the suspense but it just kind of went flat.Also there were a lot of horror tropes in this one. A lot of 'don't go in there!' 'What are you doing?!?' sort of things. It just became frustrating after a while.Overall not a bad film. I would imagine if I was a fan of the genre I would have rated it a little higher.",2022-11-06
"It was a very fun watch. The storyline was messed up but in a good way. It definitely reminded me of the descent or wrong turn (both of which is a childhood gem to me...believe it or not). It was quite a simple concept but the execution was done well. I think i would say its a bit of a slow burn but i didn't mind that. The jump scares were not too overbearing but they do utilise the sudden loud noise in a very quiet situation.The acting was great! I felt so attached to the main lead and hated some characters. This movie truly brought me anger, shock and at times feeling tense and disgust. Towards the end, I even felt feeling I probably shouldn't have felt. Like another reviewer said, I would also recommend going in not knowing anything about the movie, I didn't even watch the trailer and it turned out to be an enjoyable ride.",2022-10-26
How people rated this highly is beyond me. One of the worst movies ever. (1) nobody in the right mind would stay in an Air Bnb in a neighborhood like that (never mind 2 people). (2) why would a celebrity own that house and ever think someone would buy it in that up and coming neighborhood 🙈 (3) how did the woman have super human strength.This has so many plot holes it's crazy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The woman at her job warns her to be careful in that air bnb then when nobody hears from her again the movie just moves on. The cops come to this house in this neighborhood and sees two perfectly new cars parked outside and don't think to run the plates?,2022-12-19
"It really amazed me how magnificent the cinematography is for such an almost confined house setting of this horror film. The premise was exciting: a young lady booked an Airbnb onky to find out there was already someone in the house. I thought the director was really smart in casting Bill Skarsgard keeping in mind his creepy performance in ""It"". At first one would think he was more than just another side character. I think it was the director's sense of mystery that played with us viewers. There wasn't many jumpscares which I think was a good thing because then it would feel like another ordinary slasher film. What I didn't really like was the change in mood towards the second half. But the good thing was that it was all interconnected, and ultimately concluded in a shocking ending.",2022-11-20
"SynopsisTraveling to Detroit for a job interview, a young woman books a rental house. But when she arrives late at night, she discovers that the house is double booked and that a strange man is already staying there. Against her better judgment, she decides to spend the night there, but soon discovers that there is much more to fear than an unexpected guest.Barbarian, she leaves the feeling that horror movies can be made intelligently when they put their minds to it.The proposal directed by Zach Cregger who also writes the script. He shows that horror movies are still one of the genres that allow the most revenue when done correctly.Without covering such a complex story, the director offers us a simple story that is made up of large layers, which allow us to enjoy an interesting look at conventional terror that is executed with both visual and language management success. The feeling remains that the director of it soaked up the maximum genre cinema possible and established her own parameter to venture into it for the first time.The result is to have a movie that he likes from beginning to end, knowing how to handle his way of introducing us to real terror very correctly. In large part it is due to the great management that we find of its characters. Tess, forcefully played by Georgina Campbell, offers us a protagonist with personality and intelligence who perfectly embodies the terror that women experience on a daily basis. On her part, a great Justin Long embodies the double morality of his character and a Bill Skarsgård who is not far behind either. Having good characters helps us connect immediately with what they propose to us on screen.The rest is to have a film that manages to be penetrating and well thought out in the messages with which it intends to work. A film that becomes thicker as we understand each layer that surrounds this conventional terror, but behind it is an inspired director who knows how to handle everything accurately and gratifyingly.One of the best horror movies of this year, in a year in which the genre has been treated quite well.",2022-10-28
"Barbarian had heavy hype and big expectations before I checked it out. And while it didn't blow my mind, I can see why many film aficionados would rate it more highly. It had a fresh Jordan Peele-type feel to a story that has been done many times before. I enjoyed the different stories coming together and the obvious nods to tropes of people ignoring clearly dangerous situations and red flags. However, while it had some fun elements, I wasn't as impressed as many reviews suggested I should be. Definitely not a bad movie by any means, but some of the horror is just strange, and the creature is so bizarre that it's less scary and more awkward at times.",2022-10-27
"Reading many of the previous reviews, mainly negative and not wrong about it, I feel the need to comment on certain aspects considered plot holes by some reviewers. Even though the movie goes downhill in its second half and notwithstanding the acting of Justin Long transforming the movie's dark tension into a black comedy, fair is to say the mother and her super powers actually make some sense. Here are a few points to consider:1) what seemed to be a crackhead neighbourhood, turned out to be totally empty except for just one homeless man who figured out how to hide from the mother. Well, why was it empty? It wouldn't be crazy to assume that the mother attacked people and ate them. That's why she went out at night (not sure how she went out, though, given that the cellar window was stuck and the door didn't open from the inside). It's possible that she hunted the whole neighbourhood down and became a wendigo. In the usual folklore, wendigos are strong, taller than regular people, because of the power obtained by eating another human. That's why she wasn't frail or malnourished. Now how Frank survived and why the heavens he decided to live underground is a total mystery.2) The homeless guy says that Frank has been impregnating women , then impregnating their spawn and so on for generations and that mother is a product of inbreeding. We see the repeating video teaching her how to take care of a baby. It appears that when the neighbourhood became empty he didn't have the initiative to kidnap other women in other districts so he preferred to make his own victims. Ok, so I guess he killed the baby boys. And perhaps fed the women with them?3) Mother is afraid of Frank and she doesn't go near him. Frank can hardly move and seems to be bedridden so I wonder how he survived so far.4) Mother loved Tess and Tess killed her anyway when she is showing her love and concern. That makes the barbarian being shot barbarically. Everyone is barbaric at some point except from Keith.5) Keith's existence in the story is somehow irrelevant and is only there to distract the presumptions of what is going to happen. Given that the role was protagonized by Bill Skarsgard, this character whose presence in the house is irrelevant to the main plot, is certainly a disappointment.6) If mother went out at night, how come she never kicked down the door to attack either Keith or Tess? There's no way she didn't hear them above and she clearly had the strength to kick the door down.7) Why would Justin Long's character buy a house in that area, surrounded by dilapidated houses, with no value whatsoever? Who in his sane mind would consider that a smart investment? And how much did he really expect to get from it?8) Also, the tunnels were powered, I suppose, by the electricity feeding the house. So when the house was empty and not rented, didn't they notice that there was power being consumed anyway?9) Why was a male actor cast to be Mother? She looked like a man all the time and killed the atmosphere making it look ridiculous.10) What was the point of the whole movie? I seem to have missed it.",2023-01-23
"One of the most nonsensical movies loaded with profanity and disrespectful religious exclamations. One of the protagonists (Georgina Campbell) makes the dumbest decisions (isn't even close to believable) from start to end of the movie. One of the worst movies out there.The plot sucks, the movie drags (especially in the beginning). The other protagonist (Justin Long) says way too many curse words. Just complete filth from his introduction to the end. One of the most repulsive characters in recent history.Finally, I should have read more reviews about the movie but hopefully this review will help people.",2022-11-18
"I am a huge film fan (especially of original clever thrillers or horrors). L have watched 1000s of films at the cinema and only ever walking out of possible half a dozen films over these many years. This film was full of Random characters from random sub plots, all thrown into the same ridiculous situation ..... and all doing the same totally stupid thing that no normal sensible person would ever do. Not sure what vicious horrible things happened to them at the end, but whatever it was I'm afraid they all deserved it and I have little sympathy for any of them. I just found it all very, VERY Annoying!!! Please watch and feel free to disagree with me.",2022-11-07
"Wow, this was good, something fresh considering we are flushed with overdone dead franchises. People were shaking chairs in the theater. I was pulling my hair. Premise, setting, actors- plot twists. Spectacular horror. Worth my collection. It is hard to write something more without the spoilers but you must see it in theater without reading the reviews. I didn't and I had a certain idea in my head about the plot, so everything that transpired later was completely unexpected. Is my review needed more characters? But why? This was a great horror flick even with some morals. When I came out of theater I talked to a teenage looking male and he loved it too and he seemed to be quite well versed in this genre.",2022-10-05
"Went into this thinking it'll be a decent scare. It starts off well with character building and tension and then....jus drops the ball. Seems like the movie was rushed, everything just crammed into the later half of the movie. If someone was to ask me what was the movie about in a sentence...I really wouldn't know what to say. Was not scary, was not that suspenseful, next to no story, best thing about it was the Detroit environment but movie felt like a bite off of Don't Breathe. Actually to think about it now it does have a lot in common with Don't Breathe. If you want to see a bootleg version with small differences this would be the movie. I love the actors in the movie but how they used them was very poor. I'm even more shocked because of a producer and executive producer from some of my favorite scary movies of all time. I hope if you do see this don't go in with high expectations I beg you.",2022-09-09
"I was pleased with the movie overall, let me start by saying that first and foremost. IT had a couple people I recognized and was stoked to see e in a film. I had forgotten some of them were gonna be in it, such as Justin Long, but once I saw him, I knew it was gonna be a good film. Ever since Jeepers Creepers 1 20 plus years back, the dudes had a knack for playing a certain type of bloke. Thats why he was cast in Tusk years later after all.I was expecting more however, and thats not to say that this movie should be avoided, but like many modern films, trigger warnings ahead for implied stuff in it ( its horror after all, get over it).BUt I was still expecting a lot more. I seen enough fictional and real life horror, that when it comes to a film called Barbarian...I. DEMAND. BARBARISM! TO THE MAX.Andyah, I have seen the audience reactions from theatres...pfft. Kids these days, even in their 20s are sooooooft lol. Whom goes to a movie to hide their eyes and cover their ears? But then its sadly to be expected. The characters in this film were also around the same age, in theory; mid to late 20s perhaps, and it was just one poor choice after another. And in the age of modern phones...SHEEEEEESH. I get that cops in Detroit are useless. Trust me, they are useless all over the world, which is yet another reason people should carry guns for home defense, and have at least pepper spray on em when they go out to random places in DERELECT abandoned housing projects. Its like 99% of people in horro have never seen a horror film. And even worse...they always have no brains or common sense. They say ""NOPE"" stereotypically, but do jack all to help themselves, and this is saly true of people in real life all over the world. If you see something, SAY SOMETHING DARN IT! IF you cant say anything, or help out, gtfo! Run! Drive a car, push a kid off a tricycle, I dont know ffs. Just...everyone take self defense classes, everyone watch more horror, and everyone be well. * shrugs * 6.5/10 film. BUt could have been an 8 out of 10 with lots more effort and time.",2022-10-29
"I would like for once for someone who writes a review here panning the ending to give us an example of how they would have written it. After binge watching the very derivative slasher and supernatural films I found this a pleasant surprise even with all the unanswered questions.I thought it was pretty suspenseful, it kept you guessing. Was Keith the bad guy? What's behind each door that's discovered? You know something's going to happen but you're not sure what.I like how at the very least you're given a hint as to what happened to the neighborhood. I was asking myself that question and then came the flashback. I was left assuming the original owner is the reason the neighborhood died. People moved away because of all the women that were being kidnapped but if this is the reason, wouldn't the FBI be looking very closely at the one person who didn't move away?I also came to the conclusion that AJ played by Justin Long was in fact guilty of the crime for which he was accused. Why? Because as the owner of the Airbnb he probably knew it was being doubled booked but didn't care so long as he was getting paid twice. Plus any advertising of the Airbnb such as brochures, no doubt either hid or made the neighborhood appear much nicer than it actually was otherwise who in their right mind would rent it? And of course what he did in the end.Yes, you are going to come up with a lot of why this and why that questions but like the Geico commercial, when you're in a horror movie you make bad decisions.It's worth at least one viewing.",2022-10-31
"The cover of this movie made me disbelieve that it would be a good movie, based on the premise which was very subtle. No, it was a great movie. Directed by the amazing Zach Cregger of Whitest Kids U Know (R. I. P. Trevor Moore,) this surely propelled the old crew back into the limelight of Hollywood. Avoiding coming out on Shudder was a smart move. I love Shudder, but they really get sappy. This wasn't the mix of 10 Cloverfield Lane and Psycho that I expected, at all. It started off that way, which was intriguing, but then it extrapolated into Castle Freak! What a surprise. Plenty of jump scares enough to hurt my back while watching it. I didn't expect Justin Long to be in the movie, either. His singing in the car right after some of the scariest moments in the movie refreshed the cache of suspense really, really well. He really has risen above in such movies as Tusk, from the typecasting we all expected of him. This was one heck of a rollercoaster ride, throughout. Even the disbelief of some of the police scenes was enough to grow cringes during the climax of the plot. The flashback scenes were well done, too. Plus, it has Bill Skaarsgard, (2017 It's Pennywise) in it. Overall, way better than I expected it to be and very layered. Cregger sure does have a lot of crazy ideas!",2022-12-27
"Horrifying. I would not recommend it to someone who doesnt like horror. I dont. But still I gave it a chance. Not my cup of tea. Bad lighting. This is so wrong on many fronts. Tells a lot about a place like detroit and the bad neighbourhood places. Some people are inherently evil and some develop the evil nature in themselves. Everything wrong that can happen at an airbnb, happens in this film. Strectched it a lot. Could have been a lot better if the film was edited better, less run time. The people behaving naively. Story could have been better. We get the background and the story, but that wasnt the way to put it forward. Ending was too dramatic. Feels like the writer is living in a happy place and writing this worse of an ending.",2022-12-28

I would like to start out and say that this is a very interesting premise and it could have been really good. I think it was just they were trying to cram so much into the one movie that the pacing is funky and leaves very many plot holes and questions. I think if it had been two movies this and then like a prequel or backstory on the creature after would have been really good cause it definitely is interesting don't get me wrong it just could have been a lot better.Best way I can explain it is like a fever dream and a lot is happening and also nothing at all. There is a lot of build up to very little action as well as senseless extra scenes and info that means nothing to the plot of the movie like the new character if you had just scrapped him and kept our two original protagonist trying to make it through and learning about who this creature is what it wants what's it's story this would have been a very amazing movie. Once the first guy died the movie fell off it gives you a new pointless character and a half baked backstory about the father that didn't make much sense and only left more questions then answers.Like why did the guy stay in the town knowing what was in the house and didn't try to warn anyone didn't let the people of the next town know what was going on? Why was the town so decrepit and that women tell her not to go there when obviously no one lives there what's the reason she should be careful? Why did the guy just try to scare her instead of warning her? Why did the creature not get them at night and wait till they found her. How does the creature get formula or food if the father can't move? What exactly is the creature and what exactly did the father do?They stripped everything interesting with this movie and replaced it with pointless scenes that lead nowhere... best way to describe this movie is when you know you have a dream and it's like bits and pieces of scenes that are the plot and then ones that are a whole other plot conjoined together that's this movie in a nutshell. It's weird and like not in a good way....,2022-10-29
"As a horror fan, this movie meets all the criteria to be a classic. Seeing this in theaters was absolutely terrifying for me and my girlfriend. This movie gives me a new fear of basements/cellars and actually gives a very realistic view of what ""something is in the basement"" really means. If you haven't watched this movie I advise you to watch it with a free mind and enjoy the ride. The cast was absolutely perfect from top to bottom with not one mistake in the cast. I genuinely enjoyed every single second of this film. Justin long and Georgina Campbell were the perfect actors for this movie in every way possible from the moment you see both characters all the way til the end.",2022-10-01
"I loved it more than I expected to, and it was faaar more messed up than I expected it to be. Every actor was fantastic, every moment felt natural and every line was believable. I didn't know what to expect at any given moment and I was uncomfortable and tense the entire time - which I live for. It didn't feel exhausting, boring, or drawn out and everything was very directly told without it being contrived or dumbed down. There were several moments when certain realizations ""clicked"" that just made my jaw drop in disgust. It was claustrophobic, grungy, damp, dark, revolting, heartbreaking, and I can't wait to see it again.",2022-09-11

Probably will end the year with this movie in my top 5, and if not it is definitely the top scary movie of the year, it is a fresh take and the way it was shot is on another level itself. Pay attention to all details and never judge the story before you fully have it put together.",2022-09-10
"Crappy plot, crappy characters, there wasn't one scene shown in this movie that was necessary for anything. There's a naked inbred weirdo running around not able to talk. There's a rapist who two minutes after saying he can make things right, sacrifices somebody. It was a giant waste if time to watch. There is absolutely no point in watching this movie. You never find out anything about the characters, this was mashed together without a thought. Nothing comes full circle. Every random person or situation they throw at you, they never dive into further so you're left with a lot of unanswered questions. You're unable to connect to characters. Poorly planned and quickly rushed through.",2022-10-08
"I rarely leave reviews and had to make one comment specifically: Those who are leaving negative reviews didn't understand what was actually going on in the movie. There was only one ""plot hole"" I can think of but it somewhat plausible . But I will leave this up to the viewer to make their own speculation and draws.It will definitely be on the a cult classic list because of the web it weaves.I enjoyed the ride. 100% not what you will ever guess or expect. It was also cool that the trailer has nothing that actually spoils the movie.Ending is sweet justice to help wrap the movie up and end on a positive note.",2022-09-14
"How is the rating so high?! I'm defiantly on the perplexed camp if not out right dislike of the film. There was potential in the idea but myself and the person I watching this with were just left scratching our heads. Not scary, had atmosphere at the start but was never actually scary. There was potential in parts of the idea (the idea of being kidnapped and the process) but the random flash backs, flash fowards, multi side narratives and the shifts of narrative focus really took you out of the moment. The villain reveal was also meh, its always better not to show your baddie in good lighting.",2022-10-27
"The old horror tropes.Let's face it. If characters did exactly what everyone else would do, they wouldn't get themselves into situations that people end up in, in horror films and there'd be no suspense.That said, there is genuine effort here, for the most part, of characters trying to make the right decisions, but for reasons that are less realistic, they're not having any luck. Getting hold of people. Getting help from police etc.There is genuine atmosphere though and a very definitive act structure. I love the way it goes from Act 1 to Act 2. And I like the flashback though at first, it wasn't clear that's what it was. All very well done. Classy in fact. It all comes together in a neat fashion that isn't evident as we're progressing through. That's rare these days. (Or any days when it comes to horror).It's a little over the top but what horror film isn't? Few and far between.Anything today that isn't a sequel, spin-off, homage, ie ripoff, deserves our attention and respect. And the fact that it was all done on such a small budget is quite remarkable. I loved the sets. The houses and the location work (Bulgaria).The only setback for me is what's become, sadly, the cliché of characterization. It's evident in almost every film and series now. Even commercials. (Previous attempts at a deeper analysis resulted in rejection. You know the drill).What was interesting, speaking of modern clichés, is to see how quickly and easily an accusation can destroy someone completely. In this case, he was obviously guilty, but what if the person was innocent and it was merely to get someone out of the way and garner sympathy and gain as we saw with Johnny Depp? That to me was the real life horror story right there.All in all a great atmosphere and really well directed. It was refreshing and very enjoyable.",2023-01-11
"This movie was god awful. I won't even spoil anything, but I would never recommend this to anyone. The cgi effects were a joke, actors were okay, but the main character was so infuriating. The story line was extremely lacking, with so many holes in it. There were so many ""suspenseful breaks"" in the movie it takes you out of the ""horror/thriller"" aspects. The entire thing felt like a joke, and they explain little to nothing about the actual backstory, and what they do explain doesn't even make sense in the end. Not gorey like other reviews say, not entertaining, not scary, not worth any time whatsoever.",2022-11-01
"So I'm going to start with the positives.This films starts off great, the cast is great, the story is tight and shot really well. It has a relatable story of a woman who rents a house while on a job interview. And things don't go to plan. Enough said on that. Its did however feel familiar.A couple of really good well done jump scares tooThen halfway through it take a massive twist I didn't see coming at all and then it sort of takes a bit and I did say a bit, tiny dip and goes in a completely different direction but it's fine its still good.Then it switches it up again and tells the story from someone else's prospective.I just got the feeling of the film don't breath. But still a great film.",2022-12-17
"Barbarian (2022)Now this is what I call a horror movie that keeps you guessing the entire time with an exciting story that is specifically structured to make the most of each subsequent revelation. It's not that there are mind-blowing twists every 5 minutes, but the fact that it's difficult to predict what will happen next is certainly a refreshing feeling. Furthermore, most of the surprises aren't just stupid things for the shock factor but are genuine tools to move the story along. With half the horror masquerading as thrillers, it nice to see something that truly fits the genre in a satisfying fashion.The Barbarian begins with a woman named bbbb coming to an Airbnb that she rented out for a couple of days. She arrives late at night in the middle of the pouring rain and finds that there is another person already staying the house. When that person happened to be Bill Skarsgard, I thought I had the story figured out and the subsequent plot developments all worked in lime with my assumptions. Man o' man I wasn't ready for what would happen next and that was just the beginning of a wild ride.I honestly expected The Barbarian to be some elevated thriller nonsense but I couldn't pass up on a horror with Bill Skarsgard. From start to finish, I was fully engaged with the narrative thay provided an interesting story, good direction and actually a couple of scares. The rating would have been even higher if not for one element that didn't quite fit the narrative, and if the movie supplied more in the fear department. Nevertheless, the constantly evolving story that kept me guessing the entire time is certainly the factor that makes this film worth a watch.P. S. I am actually going to an Airbnb after 2 days amd I can't remember if there is a basement on the property.Movieswithoutshmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV Show reviews.",2022-11-09
"My new favourite horror of the year. It's best to go into this knowing as little as possible. Apparently the trailer helps you to do that.The film starts with a woman turning up to an Air BnB which has been double booked and the story starts from there... It's a tense, scary horror thriller with a good dose of dark humour which genuinely makes you laugh of loud.The films does a good job making you think it's one thing before it does another. Tension is built up massively throughout the film and at other times the movie pulls you out of the horror genre altogether before plunging you back in from a new angle. Each of the main characters are interesting in their own way and the film even manage to squeeze in a bit of social commentary which doesn't seem out of place.A strong horror, thriller with a good dose of black comedy.",2022-11-04
"After the first half of the movie, which in all fairness was pretty decent at building tension, the movie kind of fell apart. It was clearly designed to be funny and did a great job at making me laugh. Once the comedic vibe sets in, the film can't get the tension back. It's sad because it could have been good. I couldn't figure out why so many people thought this was good. The acting was decent, especially bill scarsgard who did a very decent job. The acting is the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. The villain if you could call it that, was surprising at best, not scary at all. Once you understand what's happening the movie becomes a joke. Don't waste your money. See it on streaming.",2022-11-01
"I couldn't tell who the barbarian was the entire movie. Was it the basement lady, the pervert old man in bed, Tess, Keith, or the rapist? Perhaps it was the screenplay writers for this ridiculous storytelling. The story started off promising but quickly took a nosedive into a complete mess of different pieces with no really connection or substantive back story. The completely failed to drive it home. And it lacked jump scares. I can't even name one.Tess was completely unrelatable from beginning to end! First she willingly stays at a house with a strange man, then she feels the need to follow after him after he practically gaslit her when she warned him of the strange obscenities she found. When she finally had the chance to escape, she then decides to save the second stranger knowing what that thing was capable of? Nothing made sense about any of her decision making. She did all she could when she told police about the house. Now leave!",2022-09-17
"It gets the 4 points for building up tension at the first half but after that it's a big fat nothing. When the actor dudebro is introduced that's when the movie dies, they shoehorn in annoying agenda, pretentious allegory and boring elevated ""horror"" only enjoyed by pretentious people.How could anyone even feel frightened by the second half, it just makes you feel miserable like most of the so-called elevated horror movies while the foundation of the movie is extremely dumb, unrealistic and boring.Honorable mention goes to the comically unhelpful cops that treat a woman that had OBVIOUSLY been in danger as completely crazy. You just know that anyone who wrote this scene loves smelling his own farts every evening in his gated Hollywood mansion.",2022-10-28
"I was not expecting what I witnessed when I started that movie. When the first shift in the movie happens I was terrified, until eventually I got used to it; was only unsettled at that point. Some decisions made by the man characters I hadn't predicted, and I thought were bold/ unusual. There's backstory given that I still have questions about but it gives you enough to figure out what was going on. There's still plenty of holes left open but won't get touched upon.If you see this movie be prepared.. that's all just be prepared, I can't tell you what for. Don't expect anything and if you love seen the trailers you might think it but not expect it.",2022-10-26
"This movie is not at all what I had expected! I don't really know what I did expect as I stayed away from promotion for it and even after all this time, it's just I don't know hahahahI did like the movie, the pace was really good I must say Because when I realised what was happening I thought oh here we go hopefully it's not to slow but the movie bounces in different perspectives and it really helps it along the way.I don't want to spoil what's happening but a girl goes to an air B&B which is already booked by someone else and they have to spend the night, something is under the house that they must avoid and survive.That's all I want to say without saying much, a WEIRD movie but I did like it and I really enjoyed how it ended! 7/10.",2023-04-14
"I thought it was great!Scary.Original.Thought provoking.Twists and turns.My wife and I just finished this, and we both agreed that it was very well done.A great horror movie evokes a sense of dread in the viewer, an even better horror movie keeps you engaged. This one keeps the hooks in you! The pacing is just right, and the scares are well timed! Viewers have such short attention spans these days, and we are inundated with so many terrible horror films, it is important to find the good ones in the heap! And this is a hood one!You can't help think what you would do in a situation like this?Without spoiling anything, this movie manages to bring the horror in an unsettling way, while delivering a fun horror payoff!",2022-10-27
"TLDR: Barbarian is a decent but overrated horror movie with poorly written characters.The good: The creepiness is well done. Barbarian features some run-of-the-mill but well-done horror tropes. The monster is scary and succeeds at being a monster.The bad: Justin Long as an actor, and his character. Unnecessarily unrealistic characters and situations may have been written by middle-school students. Barbarian tries so hard to be clever but succeeds at being imbecilic in parts. Justin Long's character is your prototypical ""too stupid to live"" horror movie character, and to make it worse he's a terrible actor. I'm knocking off two stars for him alone.Overall: It's not terrible, but I can think of a few hundred better horror movies right off the top of my head. If you have HBO Max and you've seen literally everything else, Barbarian is serviceable.7/10.",2022-11-05
"In the middle of the night, Tess is forced to accept the fact that the house she rents has actually also been rented by a man she doesn't know. Tess nevertheless decides to stay overnight, but she soon learns that there is something more suspect than the house she rents than the man.One of the horror movies in 2022 that is good and a little weird. It opens with a scene where the main character Tess (played by Georgina Campbell) who has to stay together with Keith (played by Bill Skarsgard) due to a mistake in renting a house. Originally, we were faced with a conflict between two strangers who met each other and did not know each other who had to stay together in one house. Conflict is built with feelings of mutual suspicion. Great suspicion falls to Keith's character if you look at his movements. However, all of that was disproved after the incident underground. It was the first phase built into the film.The second phase discusses from AJ's point of view as the owner of the rental house which ultimately answers the questions and mysteries of the first phase of the film. In this second phase I don't think it's any good. It looks more and more unclear and looks weird. The mysteries in the dungeons are less to be explained well. The film still looks less convincing in the second phase until the end of the film. Discussing the conflict from AJ doesn't have much influence on the story. In fact, AJ's role here is unsatisfactory. It doesn't have good enough acting on this film. By the end of the film, the film has an unexpected, obscure ending and is performed quite strangely.",2022-11-28
"When I was watching this movie I wasn't expecting much however while a was watching it I was very surprised I didn't expect all these things coming , I must say I really like it , there were things I didn't like but were only few things , this movie has something new , if you want to have a great horror experience you should watch it , I recommend watching it without watching any trailer I think that could ruin you experience a little bit.When I said that this was one of the best horror experiences I've had I mean it because I felt scared and that hard you know because we love horror movies , well that's my case.",2022-12-15
"Barbarian.A woman called Tess who has a job interview in Detroit is staying the night at an airbnb ,discovers that a stranger is already staying there .It's been a while since I've watched a movie or write about it and I'm really happy that I did so, tonight !The question was , why an horror movie ? The answer is why not!I'm not a top fan of this genre but thank god I didn't miss this one because it's definitely going to take place in my 2022's top list.Well , Barbarian is an horror movie that makes you confused about classifying it as a spiritual kind of horror or bloody one , you just can't identify the threat but you feel it from the early beginning ,with those creepy voices and the camera side moves that were absolutely perfect and unique . I enjoyed these small details .This movie is almost a one location movie which makes you even more frightened ,some jumpscares got me in this one and some fake ones were very well placed , it's just not a cheap kind of horror I would say ,it is a lot more than that ,their is a consistent plot that started up with so many unanswered questions and ended up with a clear head .I really had a wonderful experience , great job Georgina Campbell and the creepy Bill Skarsgard , this film made my night ,my week actually .",2022-12-08
"The ending made me so SAD for the monster! The monster just want to have baby, family and something that the normal people have. The monster does not know what its like to be normal or thriving in the real world! It's clearly means she live for her whole life in isolated house and does not know what is right or wrong! I can see her tender loving to her ""Baby"" and she got something that she does not deserved for it! I rented this movie on apple tv and then I felt so sad for the monster for all night! I finished watch that movie and then I get in my car, drive around and shopping around. I was literally thinking about why its has happened to her and she did not deserved that!",2023-02-24
"I just got finished watching Barbarian and must say it was well worth it,I had saw the cover art work before and knew it was a current movie in theatres so put it on and was hooked from the first 20 minutes the writer made sure there would never be any moments where the viewers attention would slip with so much anticipation of what will happen next and also taking the story into different
directions very well done. The acting was excellent everyone involved was believable the atmosphere,pacing was all there,at times you're not quite sure where things are going but it makes sense
in the end.This reminded me of Stuart Gordon's Castle Freak from 1995 not 100% identical obviously but not far off either so check that out if you liked this.",2022-11-18
"Barbarian is a horror movie but not one with ghosts and the supernatural, rather it's people who are the cause of the horror and terror experienced in Barbarian.Barbarian starts off with Tess and Keith who thanks to a booking company mess up discover they've double booked the same house to stay at. The movie has Keith being pretty nice and rather awkward around Tess at first which made me think that he liked her. However Tess is very wary around him at first and this makes him the prime suspect for being a creepy murderer or rapist for the first 1/3 of the film. He makes her a cup of tea which she doesn't drink and later waits until she is done in the shower before offering her wine so that she can see him open it in front of her, for security reasons like not slipping any drugs etc into her drink. All of this is just Keith being nice and a bit awkward around her but the way the movie makes it all happen and the way it's presented to the viewer definitely makes us suspicious of Keith for a while there, though I really liked him xD.Anyway eventually thinks relax, they have a nice evening together, and the next day Tess goes for her job interview. When she gets back home she gets stuck in the basement and has to wait until Keith gets back to help set her free. During the wait she discovers a hidden room in the basement with a camera, bed and bucket in it. Once Keith gets back he opens the basement and free's her but wants to see the secret room for himself. At this point everything goes downhill.The movie cuts to another guy AJ an actor who is being accused of sexual harassment/rape by his co-star. He is the owner of the house that Tess and Keith were staying at, anyway due to the upcoming lawsuit he is in some financial issues so he travels to the house himself to get it ready for sale. Unlike Keith who seems to be a good guy all round AJ enters the story with the rape accusation hanging over his head and through the rest of the film we see how he acts and the decisions he makes which reflects the terrible person he is. Tess spends the movie trying to save first Keith and then AJ and Keith, well poor guy is just there to divert our suspicions towards him until we discover who the real monsters are in Barbarian. A good, solid, interesting storyline from Barbarian, thats for sure!The casting was pretty great I think, Georgina Campbell does an outstanding job as the female lead and at portraying Tess and the type of person she is. She is also really pretty so it's a win-win for the viewer. Bill Skarsgard is amazing as Keith and does a brilliant job at portraying the genuinely nice and awkward young man that Keith is, while still making us look at his character with suspicion and wonder if his about to kidnap, rape and murder poor Tess. AJ played by Justin Long is good as well, we don't like him from the start and by the end we have to wonder if we feel more sympathy for him or the The Mother (The big bad of the movie).Directing was great, VFX and SFX was good and no complaints really. The reason for Barbarian only getting a 7/10 from me is because I was expecting a scarier monster. Still it's a good movie and very enjoyable and if you're a horror movie junkie or fan then give it a try.",2022-11-15
"At the start it was good script, later on conversation became baby script. I can write better script than this movie,
When it comes to movies, a well-written script is undoubtedly one of the most important aspects that contribute to the success of a film. A poorly written script can lead to uninteresting characters and weak dialogue, which can cause the audience to lose interest in the story.A good script should have a strong and engaging storyline with well-developed characters that the audience can relate to. The dialogue should be meaningful and drive the plot forward, and the overall structure of the script should be well thought out and engaging.",2023-03-25
"Yeesh, I read the first featured reviews for this after watching it, and it's like they presuppose that every popular or critically acclaimed movie is supposed to be deep and layered with intellectual meaning, insights, and subtleties.Let me simplify this movie for anyone who hasn't seen it yet: there is nothing deep or intellectual about it whatsoever. It's plainly a movie that is meant to entertain, keep you in suspense, and mainly to have a good time viewing. Yes, it's entertaining and worth a view, in my opinion.It does start off more promising than it evolves into, but even still it's an entertaining horror flick. I will say though that the concepts and ideas they based the story on had much more potential in story development than the direction they went with it, but it's not half bad.I'll give a shout out to Campbell and the male actor Long who added some laughs. It's a crazy movie that could've used a better ending and maybe more profundity, but for an entertaining couple of hours, it was pretty good. It goes from realistically creepy to eyerolling creepy, but overall had decent writing and suspense.7/10.",2022-11-13
"I found this movie fascinating and absolutely brilliant. Many people might see it as a pretty straightforward horror flick. I could even understand the argument that it's just another ""Don't go into the dark cave alone"" story. The subtext of the movie, however, makes it a work of genius. The acting is excellent, and there are some solid scares and genuine tension. The chewy center, however, is in the metaphor. Upon a cursory viewing, many people will notice that most of the characters act irrationally and unrealistically. Nobody would really behave like that in real life, would they? If you don't dig deeper, it could easily ruin the movie with what appears to be bad writing. But when you realize the entire film is a metaphor about sexual assault, how victims behave leading up to and after an assault, how friends and family react, how authorities react to and treat victims, it makes much more sense. It even makes a point about how people who try to help victims of sexual assault often get shamed or even targeted by apologists (or industry professionals). The horror genre has often been used to make a point or a commentary about human nature and/or human behavior. This movie does it beautifully, and everyone involved should be proud of the work they did on this film.",2023-01-13
I don't really like the film. It's a take on view of the past and women's abuse. The saddest part is it is more pointless about how this is a ripoff of other better films of the same premise. Times are all about negative views on life not anything good or fun anymore. This is less about a horror film and more about the perception of view. Not a good film at all. The Hills Have Eyes is a way better film of this dystopian world. Blend in the above film and add some of the silence of the lambs meets a serial rapist and you have a film called Barbarian. It could have been better if it were based more on gore towards a critical need not agenda. I bet TikTok and twitter loves this crap.,2022-11-11
"I went in blind and got thrown for a loop. What a just odd movie. I ended up liking it but not as much as I could have. I think this movie has some amazing aspects to it but it can feel a bit too much like a portfolio to show what you got with a lot of different techniques used. It can become too gimmicky. The movie is overall scary though and I had a good time with it.A young woman named Tess has to do a job interview in Detroit. She crashes at an Airbnb but someone else is already there. They decide both to stay there but things go bump in the night at this location.The acting and dialogue was pretty good, minus a very written scene towards the end. The way Tess and the character Keith talk is pretty well written and works. The standout performance was no doubt Georgina Campell as Tess. She gave wide range of emotions and really played into the fear you would feal in the situation. Another great performance was Matthew Patrick Davis but don´t look anything up about him for this movie.This is a movie you should go blind into as it's the subversion of expectation that is the key of this movie. It will either work on you or you´ll find it annoying. I´m a bit 50/50 on it. The first break left me with an open mouth but then I really wanted to get back into the core of the movie. I understand what the idea was but I find the first 40 minutes of this movie better than the rest. It´s a strong paranoia story that really makes everything come together as the movie goes on, while the rest is a good scary story too. I also love that the movie doesn't go too hardcore as it could have. It´s implied horror and that can be just as scary.The use of lighting in this movie is phenomenal. The movie uses a sharp contrast between light and dark to create this claustrophobic movie where your eyes cling to the light source. There is also an amazing reveal where a Tess arrives at the Airbnb at night, not seeing how scary the neighborhood is until it´s day. It, again, plays into the subversion of expectations again in a beautiful way. There is also something about just barely being able to see what´s in the darkness. It´s so well done and very scary.This also helps the amazing felling of tension this movie has. It has a few scares but primarily this movie is tense and uses it´s camerawork and lighting to really get under your skin.The movie goes for many different moods, and I think it both works and doesn't. It has scary scenes, tension but also humor and thriller. It can be a bit jarring going through these different moods and I think the movie works, but also feel a bit messy because of it. It can fell a bit like a portfolio movie, showing what you can, and it can feel transparent in that way.Same could be said about the camerawork and story structure. It fells like it´s here to show what you as a filmmaker can do. The camerawork is varied in many different ways. Maybe to distinct things, but it fells more like a ""just course"" decision. Same with the story structure, I understand why it´s done but to get you the gut punch but again I was 50/50 about that.Overall I found Barbarian good and highly enjoyable. I think the movie aspects of the movie peaks through a bit too often, and the change in mood and direction wasn't quite for me. But this is a really good scary flick and it´s camera, lighting and tension is amazing.",2022-12-01
"I'll be honest. I read the synopsis for the movie & thought it was dumb. I watched it last night & was pretty much enthralled by what was happening. My buddy watched it last week & told me to check it out. He said it was crazy & one of the best horror movies he'd seen in awhile. While I agree, this movie has you in the first act. The second act is very goo, almost as much as the first. The last act seems to fall a little flat & almost predictable. But I still enjoyed it in its entirety. I wouldn't say it's the best horror movie I've seen in awhile, but it's very good, very suspenseful and you need to watch until the end.",2022-11-02
"I some how this missed this one, having read a snippet in my movie magazine and some friends said it was good and then it made decent money in opening weekend so thought I'd give it a go and was pleasantly surprised.It always the movies you never read to much in to so you go in and not knowing much, but this was a really good film!A movie that starts off slow paced and not knowing where it's going, becomes disturbing and very creepy, with good use of music for suspense.. I thought the plot was brilliant with two great leads 'Tess' and 'Keith' lots of jump scares, a refreshing horror movie!",2022-11-10
"I had very high expectations going into this. Everything I heard was a positive for me. Weird, outrageous, scary, and so on. It sounded like everything I would want in a movie, and it kind of was, but it also suffers from a ending that struggles to find its footing. But no matter! This is a certified, ""TheRealPetraeus"" review, and that means it's time to make a review that is far too long!The story is probably one of the strongest (if not the strongest) part of Barbarian. The opening alone is extremely well done and sets everything up so well. Establishing the bad neighborhood, the characters of Keith and Tess, and the house where we are going to spend most of the movie in (or technically below). I think the VERY slow start was a great idea. It takes 40 minutes to reach the tunnels part that the trailers advertised! For a movie that isn't even 2 hours long, that is a very slow start. But the slow start is so good. Featuring some genuinely creepy scenes and worldbuilding. But the story, while good, sometimes is not presented as well as it could be, and I think this problem comes from the editing. The editing can be extremely jarring, and I feel like it's going for a style, but it doesn't work in my opinion. The introduction to Justin Long's character is hilarious and super entertaining, but the editing that happens right before it, is... Weird. It isn't terrible, or even bad, but it feels out of nowhere, and I think they could have transitioned to his part of the movie a bit smoother.I see a lot of people talking about the ""twists and turns"" and I'm going to be honest, I don't know what they are talking about. The story very smoothly guides you along a track that explains all the story beats along the way, and I never felt shocked at a reveal or anything like that. There were some nice ""reveals"" but still, nothing jaw dropping or shocking. The entire premise is extremely weird, yes, but not shocking.Speaking of how weird this movie is, it is EXTREMELY WEIRD. I have never been so grossed out at a movie in a while. Some of the stuff in here is close to being repulsive, and it probably is for more casual horror fans. I'm surprised this kind of movie went so mainstream. It feels like some horrific indie abomination, in a good way. The monster design is incredibly unique, but it has one big flaw. It isn't very scary. During the parts where the visibility is low, yea, it's terrifying, but once you see it in full view, and in a brightly lit area, it loses almost all of its scare factor. This happens with majority of horror movie monsters though.The cinematography is phonemical. Probably the best I've seen all year. Each shot is extremely good looking, and either creates a very creepy atmosphere, or creates a somewhat peaceful feeling. Especially during some sections halfway through the movie. Every shot in the house is creepy and unsettling, which is not what I can say for majority of horror movies. Honestly, I can't wait to see what else Zach Cregger comes up with, because his visuals are stunning.The acting is amazing. Everyone plays their roles perfectly. Justin Long is hilarious and even though he is a morally terrible person, I couldn't help not rooting for him. This has made me want to watch what else he has been in considering this is the first time I've seen him in a movie. Well, I've seen him in some other stuff, but I don't remember him. Georgina Campbell was great at creating a likeable protagonist right off the bat. And Bill Skarsgård played the role of some innocent guy really well.The characters are an interesting subject. Everyone here is entertaining or likeable, but I wouldn't say any of them are very deep. I don't think any of the characters here are that memorable (aside from AJ). Tess, as I said, was likeable, but I couldn't form a strong emotional connection to her, same with Keith. Considering those are the only main characters, they could have been a bit stronger.The ending is by far the weakest part. Maybe not the ending, but instead the entire climax. It goes on for too long, and is kinda predictable. There is going to be a part where you think the movie is over, and honestly, I think that's where they should have ended it. It would have been unexpected and would have been more memorable. The ending is also where we see the monster the most, and the scariness is basically gone at this point. There are also some scenes and shots that are REALLY goofy. I don't know if that was intentional, but they definitely mess up how serious this climax feels.Did Barbarian live up to my expectations? That's a difficult question because I knew so much about this movie before going in, and yet it was nothing how I expected. It was great, but it didn't live up to the potential it had, which is disappointing, but I would still recommend it. If the ending was just a bit different, this would have been a 4 and 1/2 (or 9 stars on IMDB), but it just didn't work out. Actually scary though, and nearly no movie is scary anymore, so I have to give it credit for that. I do think whoever is reading this should watch Barbarian. It's really good. But make sure you have your expectations ready for how weird it is.",2022-11-01
"This movie is actually scary. You feel for the main character (Tess) who is a college graduate looking for a job in film-making, that takes her to an un-familiar town in Detroit. This is not a movie where you smack your head every time one of the characters makes a decision, as you might make same decision had you were at her place and that makes it even more realistic.There are 2 times when the movie switches to another character. It is new and refreshing, but that's not what makes or breaks the movie in my opinion. If anything, those parts could be even longer and converge to the full story at the end.This is a non-spoiler review so I'll summarize by saying I recommend this movie for people who like this genre but it is not an Oscar winner by any means. Exact score: 70 / 100.",2022-11-09
A good horror movie keeping you engaged though the concept feels like something already seen and we keep on predicting what's going to happen and still it amuses with it's chilling and terrifying environment. The story gets disturbing as it progress and horrors of person seem to be more horrifying than the real one. Still had a lot potential but fails to attain that stage of horror giving you feel of inadequacy at the end . A one time sure watch for horror fan . Horror genre is so vast still to attempt something different is really amazing which this movie tries and succeed to some extent. Horror fans can give it a sure try.,2023-01-11
I was actually very excited to see this film. However the story and delivery of events was terrible. They spend half the film getting to know two actors and then just introduce a third actor with no character development at all just a toxic male that's about it. A incestral giant woman with saggy boobs that will force breast feed you? Really? The audience were actually laughing when it was supposed to be scary. The trailer shows nothing of the story which was genius marketing because the start if absolutely terrible. I was disappointed and felt like I wanted a refund when the credits rolled....,2022-09-12
"Barbarian is a film I had low expectations for, I thought this was going to be one of those sub par horror movies like some of the movies that come out from Blumhouse for example, not saying all blumhouse movies are bad but it has that distinctive style that everyone feels when they watch a modern horror movie but this one is totally different and I love it for thatI will start off by saying for a indie film that only had a 4 million dollar budget the special effects look amazing and the set design was excellentThe cinematography for this film I actually don't know how do describe it, it's like a found footage film but it's shot like a Hollywood film because of the dolly shots that they usedBarbarian is a film I will not spoil because this film wants you to know nothing about it like not one little tiny detail about it so I won't say anything all I will say is go and see it but I will describe it in three words Sick, Twisted and Disturbing.",2022-10-20
"I am a huge horror fan but I really don't get the hype for this film. I don't understand why everyone is acting like this is something never before seen. Seen such ""creatures"" in films like Quarantine and obviously The Hills Have Eyes. The film makes it seem as if Skarsgard may be some sort of kidnapping psycho though that would be much too predictable so its obvious its not going that route. I don't see anything clever about following typical horror movie tropes unless you're flat out making satire/parody so don't get why people were impressed by this or thought it was funny. I didn't find anything funny or particularly scary. The reveal of the deep dark tunnel was meh and left us with a weak backstory at best basically told to us by a homeless dude. A mass grave of his rape and incest victims could have fixed that. There was also no explanation of how they survived down there all those years. Safe to say after this and Tusk I will no longer watch horror flicks with Justin Long in them. He hasn't done a good one since Jeepers Creepers. This was a very mediocre horror film that I won't be seeing again and was overall disappointed by.",2022-09-18
"TLDR: A fantastically strange and totally unpredictable Horror film that I will no doubt be showing to all my friends for a fantastic horror film night. Although the last 10 minutes do leave more to be desired.When it comes to originality in story structure I give this film a 10. Wonderful and bonkers. It kept me guessing right till the final act.I can't say a thing about the plot because if I spoiled this film for anyone I wouldn't forgive myself. But it's solid and quite disturbing too. But never fully scary.My main flaws are with how sudden it all ends. It really feels like the best content of this film is the first and second act. That final 10 mins felt like they had no idea how to end it and it fizzled out a bit. Don't get me wrong I did enjoy the ending but it by far didn't live up to the pace and the tension of the film before. There are loads of plot holes too. But I can over look that because of how much fun I had watching this film.I loved this film as a horror fan. It felt like a homage to the horror films of new and the 80's. But I can also see how this film will not be what you expect, I can promise you that, and some people may be put off with how sudden and drastic the twists are. I for one loved this film and its sheer unpredictable nature. I was gripped from start to finish and as horror films go this was the most engaged I have felt in years. Saw levels of creativity and twists. I loved it, despite its very strange structure and admittedly weaker ending.There is so much more I loved but I simply can't say, that would spoil the simply jaw dropping twists. And I wouldn't want to do that at all.I guess when it comes to horror films I judge them based on what I think they want me to feel vs how I actually felt. This film, from my perspective, was made to keep you in suspense and to surprise. It played off common genre tropes of new suspense thrillers like the stranger, and also tropes from a different genre I can't say without spoilers. This film kept me guessing and I had a blast trying to predict it through out.",2022-10-29
"Overall the film was interesting in a way I'd say definitely watch it for it's unique-ness.But just cause it's different doesn't mean it was a perfect 10/10.Enjoyed the twisted, but it did get pretty predictable after that....but didn't see the twist coming.PROS:
-GREAT acting and chemistry with each relationship with the characters
-Really makes viewers interact with the story by putting themselves in the shoes of the charactersCONS:
-The pacing was alittle longer than usual
-While it wasn't bad there's a strong you either like it or hate it 50/50 that makes it alittle too controversial
-Some plot holes but I guess sometimes left out information leaves the viewers thinking more.",2022-11-03
"I've heard that the best way to go into this movie is not knowing anything about it, so if that's what you intend to do, maybe don't read this review all the way to the end. It's definitely a twisted nesting box of a horror movie, with three distinct narratives that twine together into one whole. The title is a play on the name of the street where this takes place, but it's also a reference to the criminal negligence that so many characters in this film are guilty of, as well as the lengths to which many of them will go to defend themselves. In addition to that, it's a pointed and direct reference to the character whose actions set up the entire sequence of events. The initial setup of the film's runtime finds a young woman arriving at her airbnb rental on a literal dark and stormy night, only to discover that the place has been double booked. What proceeds looks like it might be the setup to a survival horror, and the casting of Peter Skaarsgard goes a long way to cementing that idea, and his behavior throughout does not dissuade it. Eventually our heroine, Tess, discovers literal hidden depths to the house (which may also be haunted though this is never directly confirmed) and before we finish her story, we're switching abruptly to Justin Long's character AJ, who is the house's owner. Through a downward spiral that was his own fault, we find out that AJ has been using the most irresponsible realtor in the known universe (or could she be in on it?) and then his story and Tess's dovetail before we get the narrative of Frank back in 1980. Then we flash-forward back to Tess and AJ again. I won't spoil all the biggest surprises, but I will say that a vagrant who helps Tess out warns her that there's worse than what she's already seen, and the possibilities encompassed by that covers a multitude of plot-holes in my mind. There are a lot of good creepy moments and jump scares, but what I appreciate most about this film, and might be influencing me to grade it an extra point higher than I would have for just the plot alone, is that this movie knows what the audience wants in a Final Girl. Tess makes some classic horror movie heroine bad decisions, but she makes them out of good intentions and that makes her worth rooting for. That determined walk into the sunrise was everything I could've hoped for out of a horror movie ending.",2022-11-01
"I swear to god people on this site just rate really bad movies high stars bc they like the ""aesthetic"" give me a break. This movie was like 3 mini episodes stitched together and was reallllly sad like I actually felt horrible for who the villain is supposed to be like honestly poor thing. Not scary just like confusing in the beginning then creeped out in the middle then just really sad at the end. I wouldn't suggest wasting your time on this one. I know it's supposed to be a whole power to women type thing but it's really not. I'm disappointed too bc skarsgard usually makes pretty good movies!",2022-10-27
My family loves horror movies and we sat expecting some scary scenes but we saw awkward scenes. Tess's character was so dumb that even though she knew her life was in danger she goes back to save some stranger but kills the Lady who treated like a child. What a bad writing. I hate this movie. The first 20 minutes seemed interesting but when the basement scenes started the graph went down to zero. After knowing there is some wierd thing in basement she again goes deep into it. I think they wanted to shoot the entire movie inside the basement and couldn't think of much. I am sorry to say but this was the worst movie i have ever seen.,2023-04-12
"I can see how ""Barbarian"" might be scary if you're new to the horror genre, but it's really not frightening, and it doesn't feel like it's supposed to be. It's not a parody, although I did chuckle through most of it.The main ""plus"" for me was the acting. Justin Long in particular was stellar as a character with poor decision making abilities and wildly low ethical standards, and might be starting his redemption ark, but... Nope. Not so much. Georgina Campbell was also very good, however, as a woman, I am so tired of the stereotypical crying heroine she was at the start of the movie. Glad that changed in the course of events!At its heart, ""Barbarian"" is an homage to classic horror. Henrietta, from ""Evil Dead II"", was a clear inspiration for the antagonist. This almost seemed like an alternate backstory for her, and I genuinely felt sorry for the character. There was also a scene mimicking the end of ""Night of the Living Dead"", which, given the situation leading up to it, was a pretty obvious sequence of events. I can't say much more without spoiler tags, but if you watch a lot of horror, you'll recognize quite a bit here.In tone, ""Barbarian"" owes more to dark comedy than horror. Seriously, no one buys plastic bedsheets in horror movies for incontinence issues. The conversation in the store kept me chuckling the whole time. Cheesy retro television and unwatched VHS tapes with suggestive titles have an important, though underplayed, role. You can't trust men, cops, property rental agencies, etc., but the crazy homeless guy has all the answers! Watching Justin Long be harassed, for lack of a less spoiler-y word, was a cringeworthy hoot. Sometimes it felt like the movie was entirely dark comedy vignettes strung together by a loose narrative thread, which isn't a bad thing.Where ""Barbarian"" fell short, for me, was in that it was too predictable. It reminded me of too many things that I've already seen, and didn't stray far from the formula. It ticks all the trope boxes, all the time. As nicely done as it was, I went in with thoughts from other reviews such as ""subverts expectations"". No. No, it didn't. It did exactly what I expected it to, at the times when it was obviously headed in those directions. It was a cute homage. The person I watched it with isn't a big horror fan, and I had to pause the playback many times to explain why I was laughing. He still thinks I'm a horrible person, and I'm okay with that. It's a good movie, not great, but it's well-acted and directed, and I'd recommend it to anyone that's looking for an intro to horror. They might be on the edge of their seats instead of fondly reminiscing about movies they haven't watched in years.",2022-11-07
"I can understand the negative reviews if you're not a fan of horror, but if you are, you will love this movie. It covers the nuanced multifaceted sub genres within horror all wrapped into one. The acting and plot are fantastic for the genre. 'More than anything I was actually scared several times. It was smart, terrifying, and funny. Really great film that goes deeper with each watch. There is a social commentary that is more subtle. The first act is undoubtedly the best, but the tension and fear it created was not something that could've been sustained for an entire movie so it did it's job and made room for a strong final acts.",2023-08-24
"The first half of this movie seems to be a good set-up for a horror film. It establishes its' somewhat isolated setting, it has a decent creepy score, it uses shots of dark foreboding tunnels to it's advantage... but after revealing it's premise midway through, it becomes a bit of a joke, which I might actually be okay with, but the film's ultimate ""message"" is WAY oversaturated in entertainment (if we can still call it that) and it's played out and grating at this point.I give it points for being, at times, bizarre and wacky enough to actually be humorous, but holy sh@t, is this freshman orientation lecture getting old.Will the producers of 'Don't Breathe' be suing for plagiarism?",2022-09-26
The movie started great. I can see why a woman without a job going to the new town for job interview could get as cheap as possible airbnb. I can see that if you are not from that town you dont know the area you staying in is no good. And I can also see it happening that someone messed up a booking and got two people to be there at a same time.BUT MY GOD. How can you just wash it down the toilet by adding a super mutant/monster of a woman to live in there under the house? It would be A 100% better movie if you would stick to serial killer who on purpose messed up their victims airbnb.And ofc there was a lot of clichés. Which would be fine if details as a man running to warn a main character would do it maybe not as frieghtning? Maybe if the killers neighbour would notice or a question why on earth there is a name CARLOS across his name tag.And the door to the basement that closes on itself. (You can break a inside door in any house quite easily actually)All in all maybe I was just looking for a more realistic story. 6/10 movie for one night.,2023-02-26
"Had it been 30 minutes shorter, I'd not only give this a 7 instead of a 5, but also recommend people to watch it.But no, it's simply too long for the premise, too undecided to lean one way or the other and quite a tomb for the main story which could have been told in a much more fashionable way.I loved the false leads and the twists of the first act. I also enjoyed how freshly the second act began and tied in. The ""MeToo"" guy's story arc of potential redemption vs. Succumbing back to his bad self was an asset for the film.To me, the highlight was the scene where he began to measure the hidden parts of the property, paying zero attention to the horrors in obviously hosts, focusing on for how much more he can sell the place. I genuinely laughed out loud to that particular comedic genius, which was a great surprise considering the overall tone of the movie.But after that, nothing held up. The PulpFiction-esque potential of stories completing each other failed misearbly (the roommate guy became a mere prop, the girl's boss-to-be not getting alarmed on her disappearance is a huge plot hole, etc.)The worst part was the flashback meant to make sense of the propery's origins. The age of the creature fails to add up with that and the serial impregnating perverted guy's modus operandi is totally unclear.Had Disney+ provided the option to watch films 1.25 or 1.5 times faster like NetFlix does, I might have sped that up and get some more satisfaction, maybe elevating my overall score to a solid 6.But the way it is, not enough meat on this one, even despite the notable acting of the female lead.",2023-09-11
"Okay, so this film had promise all the way up until the supposedly scary character appeared. I found the first half an hour to be intriguing and it built the tension nicely. It was clear that there was going to be something evil living in the basement, and when the tunnel is revealed, you know it's gonna be good. But...when you see what's actually down there, it's laughable.The crazy woman born from incest is who lives in the tunnel, and the reason she kidnaps people is because she wants to pretend they are her baby and then breast feed them. I mean, really? And her catchphrase is ""mah...beh-beh...""? I was genuinely laughing out loud when I was supposed to be scared.I can't believe I wasted my time watching this, and the worst part is that the only reason I watched it until the end is because I wanted to see how much funnier it got. That's not how horror movies are supposed to be! Please don't watch this, you will be very disappointed if you are a horror fan like me.",2023-11-02
"The first half of this movie was, albeit a little predictable, better than I anticipated, and I enjoyed the performance of the actors, both clearly well selected and headed for greater things. The first half of this movie on its own would have been a much better movie, given some runtime padding, than the entire product turned out to be.Sadly, the midway of the movie introduces the B squad, in acting and writing, and even if the transition was clever, it is no excuse for the script falling to pieces and spending the next of the movie just catching up to the happenings and antics on the screen. Was the original script abandoned and picked up by some hack or what happened? We are provided with no explanations, pretty much no closure, and a forgettable ""open"" ending.As much as this movie is a rip off of Don't Breathe, it does even less deserve a sequel, so please do not go there.",2022-11-08
"If so, you could do with a stay at 476 Barbary St, Brightmoor, Detroit.The elements of this horror film that resonate with me are the depictions of rundown Detroit, Motor City. I've never been there and may never get the chance, but it's a legendary city for its cars and music.The cars have long since gone, and the prosperity with it. The ""affordable"" ill-maintained housing has become a boon for artists looking for affordable work spaces. This, according to the incumbent tenant at the film's opening. (Although it rings true to the evolution of many a derelict area of town, brought to life by the arts community (and petty crime) over decades, before being gobbled up by those looking for a hipster-change). I digress.The movie is very clever with its use of atmospherics, performances, and horror staples - gore, disfigurement, filth.But, like any good horror movie, it's what the ""normal"" humans do that is the most frightening.I don't know why you'd be reading my review, particularly if you've not seen the film, and thus don't understand the review heading.I've recently watched Bodies, Bodies, Bodies, as well as Smile which are each their own nasty little depictions of the human condition. Barbarian brings its own creepy flavour to 2022's horror-fest.",2022-11-09
"I am not sure how to exactly rate this. It's like watching 2 or 3 different movies at the same time. The first third of the movie I would rate a solid 8 for its mystery and suspense. The second third of the movie was like an entirely new movie starting. Then the last third of the movie brings the two movies together. It starts out as a suspenseful mystery movie, then turns into a Hill Have Eyes type movie. There are some pretty ridiculous moments near the end for sure especially involving this inbred mother type person. Is it horror.....not at all! But it's entertaining, odd, kind of gross in parts, and ends badly. Watch it when it's free to you. It's definitely one and done!",2022-11-12
Really difficult to write a review with no spoilers. It's best to go into this film with having no expectations about what it is.You expect a certain film and are given a totally different one. A nice girl with a big heart has to rent a house for a night with a creepy guest. You know where this is going... well it turns out you don't.Bam. Twist.All of a sudden 1-2 other characters come into play and some back story is revealed.In some ways this feels highly original but maybe actually it's well trodden tale originally told.It's pretty exciting and after a while you're just not sure what's going to happen at all. This maybe why the ending feels a little disappointing.However it's worth a watch nonetheless.,2023-10-04
When i was Looking for films to see this weekend and I read the description I figured I knew exactly what this would be. Then when I took a Look at the cast I realized it's kind of odd for some of the actors to take the roles and there was likely more than meets the eye. I didn't want to Spoil any more of the film and decided to just go see it. Wow. This film has so many twist and turns. Stop reading and just go see it.Typing here to fulfill the 600 word BS requirement as I'd that's some kind of authentication? This is a good move and you should go see i don't think it was too scary but a real thriller.,2022-09-19
"I went into this blind, I read no reviews or looked at an in depth plot. I did see a trailer the one with audience reaction but other than that I didn't know the plot.This was very well done, I don't want to write a spoiler and I won't but this is a multi layered film. It goes from one thing to another and appears to change story before leading into yet another. It is also unique and original which is rare in cinema nowadays because everything is either a remake, a reboot or a copy of 10 movies you've seen before.The only downside for me was it wasn't terrifying as it was made out to be, especially in the theatre reaction trailer. Was it creepy? Yes! Jump scares? A few. But it certainly wasn't as terrifying as the media and press have tried to make it appear.What made it good was it is a unique standout horror film that was cleaver, well paced, different, had some satisfying moments and a great ending.Filmmaking well done and I understand why this has been a hit. For those disappointed I don't think you appreciated what it truly was or was expecting a different type of horror. This will be a movie I remember for some time.",2022-11-01
"The first act is a boring talk-fest ""Would you like some wine? No, I'd rather have some tea"". This nonsense goes on for over forty minutes. Nothing really happens other than a double booked Air B&B.Then it picks up a little, but the suspense is deflated by long introductions of new characters who don't have too much of an impact on the narrative. The script pulls in too many different directions without resolving any of them. Lot's of creepy weirdness that is truncated by a haphazard narrative.This could have been a pretty wild ride if they had streamlined the story and focused on a strong thematic element. Once you get past the first forty minutes the rest is watchable.",2022-10-29
"If you are a sexual assault survivor, DO NOT WATCH THIS. Barbarian is a movie where a sexual assault perpetrator has a character arc that we are supposedly root for; the victim of a horrific, incessant abuse is turned into a mad monster devoid of any humanity and given superhuman-strength (even though she is supposed to be severely inbred); and the psychopathic abductor/rapist, the true villain of the story, is nothing but a bed ridden side character.The first half was very promising. The revealed backstory, however - abductions and rapes - is handled terribly. The true victim, ""the mother"", is deliberately being portrayed by a man with dollar store caveman prosthetics slapped on his forehead, to sell the idea that she is horrifying and repulsive. The woman who has been living in captivity for her entire life, who has been used like a breeding cattle - she is the one who's killing, imprisoning, sexually assaulting people on screen. The old, scary, naked woman. Movie tries to justify its stance by stating that ""the mother"" is severely inbred, as if being inbred turns people into murderous monsters. This is not how a mentally incapacitated, nonverbal person behaves. There are records of children raised in confinement, they are all harmless. No, the true monster is the one doing the confining and assault, and if this movie had any balls it would show him committing the assault instead.Barbarian shows absolutely zero empathy for the victimised women and their children; they, and the cages they were kept in are only used as a prop for this tone-deaf, badly executed horrorshow.",2023-05-25
"Totally meaningless, boring, slow progress, wasting time, not worth watching it...
It has nothing to say. You have to wait for something to happen, maybe twenty minutes, ok you get some but very short, non-professional, ridiculous, etc. It's time to wait another dozens of minutes. You beg for something to happens although you
get disappointed.The story line has nothing special to say.Neither do special effects.I do not recommend that you take any of your worthy time for this.To be fair, the sound effects may be the only positive aspects of this movie. It takes you by surprise if you try to see it in a dark and quiet room.",2022-10-25
"With real care, I'll try to convey the gist of it, without spoiling anything.Yes, the setup as is written here in sinopsys is 100% correct. Then movie goes from there.Music was great, all actors in it were great.Directing is real good and story is solid. Tension is palpable just enough to make you uncomfortable all the way through and not to peak at some midpoint just to leave you hanging later. No, it's paced very good.Also, kudos to offbeat underlying humour that works most of the time. It made a tense movie fun in a way.You should probably read as least as possible about this movie and just trust all of us recommending it. It's good, if the premise looks like your kinda jam, then it probably is an you'll like it.For me it first looked like random whatever movie, but then I noticed reviews here and there that say it's good but haven't read them. So I went blindly in it and it was good. Recommended.",2022-10-26
"A woman turns up to her AirBnB, only to discover someone else is already there, due to a double-booking. She's naturally cautious when invited to share the accomodation but the other occupant turns out to be the least of her worries ...It starts out really well and doesn't take long to get you invested in the characters. However, after the first third of the movie, things go sharply downhill as it veers off on a mansplaining mission, completely throwing all logic out of the window to give us another lecture for the me too era. It's disappointing because at one juncture it started to get seriously tense and could have gone on to be a horror classic. An awful lot of great ideas in the movie but all squandered in favour of nonsense to get its point across.Not an awful film but disappointing due to how well it started. Overall, it is very well made and the actors do pretty well in their roles but drowns in silliness eventually.",2023-01-07
"What would you do if you showed up at your Airbnb and someone was already there? That's the entire premise of Barbarian. Watching the trailer gives away no hints so it's worth the watch.The film written and directed by Zach Cregger is super creepy and you never end up shaking this eerie feeling the entire time you're watching.The first two-thirds of the film will keep you at the edge of your seat. There are so many good suspenseful moments where you prematurely wince and can't help but turn away. Cregger gives enough in each shot but leaves mystery and intrigue in the dark spaces.The cast of Barbarian is pretty good. Georgina Campbell embodies a great female lead in Tess while always creepy Bill Skarsgård is an ominous presence you expect. Justin Long's character is the dark horse here; not what I expected but I thoroughly enjoyed.That being said, the final third of the movie was a disappointment verging on campy and cringe worthy.I would definitely recommend horror lovers check this one out. It's ready to watch on Disney+.",2022-11-02
"The movie starts off with much promise but the second half of the movie is a huge letdown.The director, Zach Cregger, takes a ""Click-bait"" approach with Bill Skarsgard. Takes advantage of his ""It"" fame but disrespects the audience in the process.Lots of illogical decisions taken by the lead characters of Georgina Campbell and Justin Long. There is no backstory to the ""villains"" in the story, if you can call them so, and the main motivation of the villain is never explained but just hinted at.Horror is not an easy genre to succeed in and this movie is ample proof of that. As for the 7-star plus reviews gushing and raving about the movie, I have my doubts how real some of them are.",2022-10-27
"I haven't really watched any horror this Halloween season and I had been seeing so many fabulous reviews about this movie that I thought this is the one. Boy I was wrong.When it started out, it seemed like maybe it was headed in a good direction but took a turn into being possibly one of the worst horror films I have ever seen! So uneven and the plot makes absolutely no sense. We are supposed to believe this intelligent, professional woman is dumb enough to go down into a basement tunnel to save someone she doesn't even know?? There are so many weird things that have nothing to do with the story - who was Marcus and why wasn't he looking for Tess? He called her multiple times. What was the point of taking a pic of Keith's drivers license? Why are we are learning about the woman's father and watching him go shopping for baby stuff and setting up a house to get broken into and THEN WE NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN?? Why was the homeless guy a complete maniac at one point and then totally coherent and focused at another time? Why did this guy from LA own a house in Detroit?? Why didn't he ask his property manager to call the people that rented it? It was one thing after another that didn't make sense. Save yourself the hour and 42 minutes and watch something else!",2022-10-29
"Definitely the very horror movie of 2022, Excellent piece of work. Suspenseful, original and well acted. It has this psychological terror that just wont go away, like a Hitchcock suspense thriller and a fever dream all rolled into one movie. And it buids up till the very end. Very good story by the way. It has several twists and it will keep you entertained. A true work of art! An overall great horror movie, gets to the action very quickly, and will keep you invested till the very end. Simply put, if you are into horror-thriller movies, missing ""Barbarian"" is a Crime, in fact when this gets back to cinema , so am I .",2022-11-17
"Anything above 1 star needs a reality check. Poorly filmed, ok-ish acting, disgustingly bad plot. I've never disliked a movie to the point that I've been this compelled to write a review. In fact, this is my first movie review. That's how bad it was.The movie must have been aimed at a 12 year old audience. The characters' decisions were unbelievable in the sense that no one, under any circumstance would do what they did in their stead. The transtions and scenes looked like they were edited by some guy on fiverr. The storytelling was ridiculous at best.Lastly, if you're gonna make something so unbelievable and frankly absurd might as well call it sci fi/paranormal.",2023-08-25
"Barbarian is sort of a misleading title. More appropriate would be Don't look in the basement , but that was the 1973 movie that is great as well. A young woman ( Georgina Campbell) rents a house In Detroit for a job possibility and finds out it's double booked by a young man( Bill Skarsgard) both are puzzled by this mixup . There's a deep dark secret in this house, the basement , the neighborhood not very pleasant either . Without giving any spoilers away the movie leads you to a very dark place. This will definitely scare the hell out of you . Justin Long also appears as an owner of this house but unaware of the goings on. Barbarian is extremely bizarre and well made . Skarsgard is. Also the executive producer . And those who are familiar will I'll Skarsgard , He played Roman in Hemlock grove , and in the tv series ; castle Rock, and Pennywise in IT chapter one and two,and the forthcoming The Crow reboot. I gone 10 stars to Barbarian .",2022-09-20
"I recently saw this movie. The trailer looked interesting. From the start I was hooked. It's hard to make a review without giving anything away. The storyline was engaging, suspenseful, thrilling, and anxiety-provoking. I kept my feet up the entire movie. I did jump a few times, and held onto my dates arm most of the movie. There are many twists, WTF moments (in good ways) and funny scenes. I love Bill Skarsgard. I was biased on his role as I related him to Pennywise. The main character had me feeling like I was in the movie. That rarely happens. What kept me ""in"" the movie was the reality of daily things we do. On the flip side-I don't understand the movie title. I had several questions about the movie, such as ""what's the story behind this?"" ""this can be elaborated on and another movie can come out of this."" The movie had few characters and everyone's roles were full of adrenaline filled suspense. I give this 8/10 stars due to the questions I have. Overall, I recommend this to horror/suspense/thriller movie fans.",2022-09-12
"This was a canny little film. Making some much needed social commentary and mostly about Detroit and what has become of this once great city.Unfortunately, the pacing, editing and script weren't all that great. The film breaks off at a very promising part and never really picks up after that to deliver its promise. The story/plot holes were massive, as well as some really questionable decisions from the main characters that simply no human being would make at that point.Overall, really solid horror flick with food for thought, but bogged down by poor pacing in the middle, little pay-off and some glaring screenplay issues. One that might develop a cult following, but I hope there are no sequels, as the setup really didn't hit the highs it was aiming for.",2022-10-30
"Barbarian was an uneven and unsettling film that leads you through a labyrinth of WTFs and No She Didn't's. Viewers need to constantly suspend too much disbelief and are constantly left wondering if all the characters received lobotomies based on the choices they make for winding up in the danger zone. The performances, especially Justin Long's, felt like off-the-cuff improv sketches gnawing at the teat. Georgina Campbell does her best with the material given but she needs to have a talk with to her agent. I'm not sure what rancid milk these positive reviewers were drinking but this movie should be handled like the bath water and thrown out with the baby.",2022-11-02
"Zach Creger's intriguing and unnerving bone-chilling horror thriller is a slow burn that leads to some serious moments of tension and suspense. It concerns a beautiful young woman named Tess, marvelously played by Georgina Campbell, who arrives on a rainy night to a Airbnb rental house in an rundown and deserted part of town and discovers that it has been mistakenly double-booked and tall handsome stranger named Keith, wonderfully played by Bill Skarsgard, is already occupying the house. Keith seems like a nice guy and he invites her to spend the night in the house, he even offers her the one bedroom to sleep in, and he would sleep on the living room couch. Tess checks the nearby hotels on her cell phone and finds there are no rooms available, so she reluctantly excepts his kind invitation to spend the night. What follows is a nightmarish odyssey of pure terror in that house that she could not have possibly foreseen, for there is a genuine walking horror in the basement of the house that is deadly. Astute direction by Creger, with exquisite cinematography, and a terrific supporting performance by Justin Long as another unfortunate person that stays in that sinister house. Well-crafted with excellent production values, this is a refreshingly original and fun horror show.",2022-11-01
"The only saving grace for this movie was Justin Long's dirtbag character, everything else was just plain dumb.The back story was weak with no real explanation of anything except for the fact that the original home owner was a sadist/psycho/inbreeder. There was a comment by the homeless guy that there were far more dangerous things in that house besides the freaky woman, which tells me they plan to make this garbage into some sort of franchise.They may have added some more clarity during the ending/credits where Tess was walking away, but I didn't stay long enough to see the rest of the credits nor did I care to.There was just too many questions in this movie that just were not answered and the movie's lack of intrigue just didn't make me really care for the answers.",2022-09-18
"Coming into town for a job interview, Tess Marshall books a remote house in the rundown Detroit neighborhood of Brightmoor. Tess finds it has been double-booked when she arrives to the house and finds it is already occupied by a young man named Keith. Initially unnerved by Keith, Tess warms up to him and decides to stay the night.The next morning, Keith leaves for the day, and Tess goes to her interview. She returns to the house and is chased inside by a homeless man yelling that she must leave. She ventures into the basement and gets locked downstairs, and stumbles upon a hidden corridor.There, Tess finds a room with a camcorder, a stained mattress, and bloody handprints. Tess backtracks and tries to leave but is still locked in the basement. Keith arrives and frees her. Tess tells Keith what she has seen, and he goes into the basement to investigate. When he does not return, Tess returns downstairs and discovers that the hidden corridor she had initially found leads to a subterranean tunnel, where she hears Keith screaming for help. She enters the tunnel and finds an injured Keith. The pair are attacked by a naked deformed woman, who brutally kills Keith.Sometime later, actor AJ Gilbride learns he has been fired from his television series due to rape allegations made by a co-star. Pressured to sell his assets to pay for legal costs, AJ travels to a rental property he owns in Detroit: the same house that Tess and Keith rented. AJ inspects the house and eventually discovers the hidden tunnel. The deformed woman attacks him and he falls into a pit alongside Tess, who explains that the woman (referred to as ""the Mother"") wants them to act as her children.When AJ refuses to drink milk from a bottle offered by the Mother, she drags him away and forces him to breastfeed. Tess escapes the house by breaking a basement window. She eventually reaches a gas station and is able to call the police. The officers are dismissive of her story, but she convinces them to go back to the house with her. The police refuse to investigate the house before being called away, attributing Tess' story and behavior to drug use.A flashback to the 1980s shows the house's original owner, Frank, who abducted women and held them captive in the tunnel. He would use the hidden room to videotape himself raping them, then raise the subsequent children. Back in the present, AJ discovers a decrepit Frank living further in the tunnel. Initially believing Frank to be another victim of the Mother, AJ assures Frank that the police will come to investigate. Frank discreetly retrieves a hidden revolver as AJ discovers the tapes, and Frank kills himself. AJ flees with the gun while the Mother leaves the house to find Tess. Tess runs her car into the Mother, seemingly killing her. Tess returns to the basement to rescue AJ, but he accidentally shoots her. The two escape the house and find shelter with Andre, the homeless man who had chased her earlier.Andre explains that the Mother is a product of multigenerational incest by Frank. The Mother ambushes the group and kills Andre before chasing Tess and AJ up a water tower. AJ pushes Tess off the tower in an attempt to save himself, and the Mother jumps after Tess, shielding her from the fall. As AJ attempts to rationalize his actions to Tess, the Mother awakens and kills him. The Mother tries to comfort Tess and wants to take her back to the house, but she reluctantly shoots and kills the Mother and stumbles away as the sun rises.",2022-11-05
"In 2022, very few films actually surprise, and even fewer horror films can shock you and be good. Infact, they are so rare, they can be counted on a single hand.Barbarian, is not only refreshing, it is nail bitingly, heart poundingly good. The film has distinct acts and even upon rewatching, I'm willing to bet that each individual act is absolutely stand out. The movie is ten different kinds of sick and I'm here for it.Also props to the guys who made the trailer. In today's day and age, where watching a trailer is essentially watching the entire film in 90 seconds, the trailer for this film was such an absolute red herring, it gave next to nothing away and even led me to believe this was a comedy film with Justin Long being himself. Because no one would be crazy to do another horror after having Jeepers Creepers AND Tusk under your belt, correct? WRONG. I dont think we give enough credit to Justin Long's acting prowess.I wont say much more. But I had to note that as a serious movie-goer where horror is concerned, I am EXTREMELY impressed with Zach Creggar. 4/5 from me.",2022-10-31
"This has to be one of the most messy stories in a much awaited movie I have ever seen. I mean it honestly makes very little sense. I am only giving it a 2 due to it having Justin Long and Bill Skargard in it. Other than that this movie is just downright terrible. Why even flashback to the 90s and have ""CARLOS"" unlock the window and not atleast do another flashback to showing him what he does to get the ladies to the basement. I wish it the movie was more like the preview where it made it look like Bill would be the ruthless killer instead of an inbred killer lady that looks stupid. Wish it were better and I'm sure people will love it, I just won't be one of those people.I will give it credit for some of the cinematography and angles.",2022-10-26
"I want to try to make a good review for this movie because I really enjoyed watching it. A lot of thriller or horror movies I watch these days are very common themed, seen it before, nothing new or special. Franchises like The Conjuring and Annabelle etc. I'm sick of those movies because they really don't show anything new or different. This is a movie that starts out very slowly. You are watching waiting to see when the other shoe is about to drop. You feel something is not right right away. But what? Ok this movie is not completely original. I don't think any movie can possibly be anymore really these days with the amount of movies out there. But not giving anything away the concept is something not explored often I'll just say. So while maybe I wasn't completely blown away with how this movie progressed till the end, I wasn't disappointed watching this movie at all. I've seen so many movies in my life. Thrillers, and horrors especially. So I'm not just a casual Thriller watcher here. This movie is very impressive in my opinion. The writer and director here did a great job. Much better than his friend Jordon Peele who has let fame get to his head and put out just weird nonsense since Get Out. I hope this guy continues to make movies like this or other Hollywood people get the memo that people are desperately wanting some original content and sick of the boring bland movies like the Nun and The Conjuring number 5 or Halloween 300. If you like original content I don't think you'll be disappointed watching this movie. It's a fun time for all.",2022-09-22
"Man, this movie had great potential. The first act of the film presents an original, although unlikely, situation. The film progresses to build tension and suspense through doubt and suspicion as the villain of the film remains unclear. The first part is unnerving and unsettling.Then, there's a sudden shift in tone that for me did not work. The movie becomes almost more of a dark comedy then the spookiest it had set itself up to be. The plot shift seemed unnecessary and distracted rather than added to the film.The last part just leaves too many plot holes unanswered and becomes laughable at times. If only the writers had stuck to their guns and continued their initial course, this could have been a classic.Also, way too much nudity for no reason at all.Was very good, could have been brilliant.",2022-11-06
"I found this ""Barbarian"" to be a truly intriguing, original, but above all very scary film, some moments convey tremendous anguish, thanks to the direction and screenplay by Zach Cregger who proved to be very good and therefore I hope he makes other horror movies.The film begins in a particular way, slow, but never boring, but the interesting thing is that it seems that the story is going in one direction when in reality it is about something completely different and when the ""real"" story begins the terror begins , the twists and turns are continuous as are the moments of tension, tension that comes directly without the use of stupid Jump Scares, not to mention the excellent performance of the entire cast above all obviously the always excellent Bill Skarsgard and Richard Brake i who delighted us respectively in the role of two killer clowns, the first with the wonderful remake of It and in its sequel, good, but not exceptional, obviously in the role of Pennywise and the second in the role of the crazy Doom Head in the fun 31 directed by great Rob Zombie. Both of them have different roles in this film, but once again they demonstrate their boundless talent.I won't say anything else because this film should be seen without knowing anything because it is full of twists and surprises, so sit on the sofa and enjoy this good film.",2023-11-02
"Without giving away too much, this starts out fine but then quickly veers into one of those bad plots that was big in 70s, 80s and 90s horror movies (and even in ""The Goonies""). Then you add a dab of Michael Myers (the boogeyman) from Halloween and toss in the ""cops don't believe me"" nonsense and there you have it. The dropped gun scenario in these movies is as tired as the dropped keys. The ""it evolved from copies and copies and copies"" makes no sense since the flashback to the homeowner is to the Regan era - it's only 40 years later. So, it's not a ""copy"" - it's the original - and the only one. Also, was the main character super human? And don't get me started with 911. HORRIBLE.",2022-10-27
"Finally got around to viewing this film last night and it didn't disappoint. I watched Tusk with Justin Long last week and it was disturbing AF, so i was excited to take another long shot ;) The first thing I noticed was how masterfully crafted every shot was in telling the story creating a juxtaposed mise en scene of light and dark. The colorful use of deep and rack focus paired well with the asymmetrical chiaroscuro landscapes giving the viewer a sense of unease and claustrophobia.I couldn't help but to think... ""Did AirBnB or HomeAway ever refund Tess or Keith for the double booking?"" That kept me up last night.",2022-10-29
"1- why she who is tess back to house from town and even her friend in town warned her and Her friend knows about suburb but there is no trace.2-how can be huge mistake to rent by two people and following day never contact with agency.3- when she back to home after locked in basement Why Keith never believed her and She never talked about a guy who is enemy or not.List can be go on like that at least 20 mistakes.If you do not mind these. It really good horror movie. Unfortunately you do mind, because every stage of mistake movie can not be go on. Meaning is it takes 10 min. Short film, 20 min 30 min. Etc.",2022-10-25
"Why was this movie. Now that I've gotten that out of my system, please do your brain and self worth a solid; don't watch this. From the first twenty minutes it was apparent the script was written by a person not familiar with how life is lived in 2021-22 on planet Earth.Movies are one way to getaway from the dowdrums of reality, to let your mind wander with the ideas of the script writer. A decent writer is able to capture your imagination drawing you into their world, of course a poor one can turn you away in a flash. This particular one drove me away at light speed.The actions that are supposed to get things rolling are so implausible that only a four year old would believe. Frankly, the first act was so poorly written that it was apparent that the remaining scenes wouldn't make sense either. Yes, we viewers should suspend SOME degree of disbelief at the movies but definitely not ALL like this one does.I'm not going to spoil the plot just expectations for a vastly overrated October horror movie.",2022-10-26
"It has been a while since I watched a film driven by psychotic sentiments. Barbarian came up randomly on my Hotstar feed, I checked IMDB, almost 7 stars, so thought I would give this a go.Under circumstances, Tess gets caught up in a danger house and how she survives is the rest of the story.I love how the screenplay took its time to establish its characters really well, I mean, it felt good to a point where it felt like it could have easily been another type of film.Cinematography is another thing that I admired for the most part. Let it be the camera angles or expressions of actors, it was not like you are watching yet another cliché. Instead, the whole movie had this short film vibe, things seemed very much real.I loved the dialogues as well. They had this ability of connecting to you. Felt natural.If film watching experience is all about how the film's making you feel, I will say that Barbarian is a well made flick that makes you feel a ton of emotions through out its runtime, yet it becomes less impactful once its over, because, well, you've watched it all.Reviewed on 06-11-22. Hotstar.",2022-11-06
"I came into this movie opening night with 2 other peers of mine. Neither of us saw anything from screen-caps or the trailers. I'll start with what was excellently done in my opinion, that being the entire first act of the movie. The grounded real world scenario of the first act made it such a engaging build up, which was enhanced by the cinematography and droning music. However, what started as a interesting slow reveal of something more then what the audience is lead on to believe became completely nullified after the grand reveal of the actual threat. I'm trying to explain my perspective of the film without spoiling anything, but the film made a complete 180 becoming a much too absurd plot then what was established at that point. All suspense and fear that was built up had resulted in a film experience we were waiting to finally conclude.",2022-10-03
"Wasted all this time watching this.. let's call it ""thing"". Come to think of it, it starts with suspenful music for no reason at all. Continues at the same pace. Total Garbage. I actually need to write 600 words for this review to get accepted as a review, so here goes.They keep going down the tunnels, and then down some more. I would only get that if they were chasing a lost dog or something, but Noo.. They go down for no reason at all. Also, what kind of protein bars would that crazy lady consume to be able to split someone's skull in half? I need me some of that since I'm almost thirty but can't even climb the stairs without trying to catch my breath. Overall, this movie goes down the drain but it won't flush. You have to look at this floating until it ends. It will never flush. It will float and keeps floating and floating there.",2022-10-28
"The movie has continuation errors. I am not talking about doors open or even curtains... but just the bottle of wine and glasses in their conversation.This got me distracted. And I kept looking for them. There are quite a few of them and honestly it ruins the movie for me.Other things that are questionable
911 CALL. We don't have any available units in the area.From scary guy to love interest.Cellphone not on her the first time
Too much caring for that unknown guy.. Especially because she was initially that scared.Three acts. The past is really short. Really no need to have that order.And one wonders if flashbacks would not have worked better.Pretty amazed of the cops and the guy who knew what happened down there.In conclusion there was no message really and if there was one it contradicted itself.She would have been better of if she only cared about herself. Same goes for the alleged rapist.Kind of interesting that he wasn't apprehended for that.It's not the worst movie I saw this week so it gets 2.",2022-11-09
"If you're a fan of horror, you'll probably like this film. There's some reviews on here that are overly harsh in my opinion, so take those with a grain of salt. Barbarian takes a couple familiar themes and presents them in a new and interesting way. The film really has a ""cult classic"" vibe to it, which can be hard to pull off these days. It's informally broken up into 3 separate acts, each starting separately and ending up intertwined in the second half of the film. Throughout, the building of tension and off-putting feelings you get while watching this are done quite well.One of the only things that bothered me during the film was the depiction of the cops (no spoilers here). It was pretty clear the scriptwriter was trying to insert a message, and I got it, but it detracted from the film; really pulled me out of my suspension of disbelief. Even though some officers may act that way when interacting with repeat and familiar offenders, they would NOT have mistaken this person for a drug addict. Having worked with actual addicts in the past, none of the signs were there at all. There's other details to mention about this as well, but I want to keep this review spoiler free so you'll just have to see for yourself. That little story arc was clearly put there for ideological and political purposes; the scriptwriter likely thought it was the perfect opportunity to slip that in there, and just couldn't help themselves. Tisk tisk.Anyway, that aside, I quite enjoyed this one and I tend to be quite picky when it comes to horror. Acting was definitely on point, and there are some familiar faces in this film which was nice to see. I would suggest you give it a shot, you may just like it.",2022-10-25
"This is my first review in 16 years of being on this site. That's how horribly moved I am about this film. I was expecting a disturbing and gory movie about some 'barbaric' acts that take place in this home. Instead, I got an hour and a half of a poorly written, airheaded woman who is hell bent on saving a stranger time and time again for no reason at all.Her lack of self preservation truly ruined the movie after the 30 minute mark. But I should've known she would lack even a half of brain after she didn't immediately leave that hell hole of a neighborhood after the job interview warning.Don't waste your time on this one, your brain will not be able to fill in the plot holes or create any connection to any of these unlikable characters.",2022-10-27
"Let's face it, most horror movies are extremely predictable. Even the ones with ""twists"" tend to telegraph them from a mile away.Without giving away any spoilers, I'll say that this movie does a very good job of making you think you know exactly where it's headed and then switching gears entirely - so much so that I actually wondered if I'd accidentally changed channels at one point.It's a slow burn that maintains a genuinely creepy atmosphere from beginning to end, and it does throw in a few good scares. It's gory at times, but not overly gory like so many modern horror movies.I dinged it a couple of points because at times characters do things that are extremely dumb even by horror movie standards, but all in all I found it very enjoyable.",2022-11-22
Don't usually write reviews but had to on this occasion but I just wanted to say that when he throws the main character of the water tower and the mother jumps down after her I nearly started to cry and realized I had wasted 1hr 45 mins of my time. But with a decent premise I was sucked into believing that this could be a good movie but the dissapoitment beyound believe after watching the french movie martyrs the pinical of a horror movie and the sheer terror of that movie I then watched this comedy and felt I had been cheated out my time please do not watch this movie and save your self some brain cells and watch something else.,2022-10-30
"Strong and refreshing beginning with very good storytelling. Especially switching to second act and changing the entire scenery was something we usually don't see in this genre. Of course, plot holes were there already but it didn't bother me at all because I was expecting a proper explanation. However everything started to fall apart once Keith goes into the dark tunnel without any convincing reason and worse she goes after him. It was already hinted in their conversation at the night before and I was expecting a heroic woman act later on. The thing is, it's not about gender at all. Anyone with a sake mind wouldn't go after someone into a tunnel at middle of nowhere. I read other reviews where people listed all the things don't make sense, I agree with most of them. It's a huge list. Probably the worst is black homeless guy tells the entire story and knows who lived in the house for 40 years. So police or any other authorities didn't do anything about it and furthermore a rental agency book this place to other people? Why would you ruin this concept with such inferior script?I tried to accept these issues since this is a horror movie and there are not many horror movies where characters make smart choices. But this movie took everything so far, it lost its credibility after a while. Especially third act wasted for shock value. Girl survives, rapist guy dies horribly. Unfortunately underdeveloped characters didn't allow us to grow enough hate for Justin Long's character. First act made me so happy, I thought this will be a solid 8/10. In the end it fell short big time, such a waste.",2022-10-26
"I love good horror movies, and sometimes even some cheesy ones. I went in with, what I thought were reasonable expectations, but I definitely just wasted my night. Some parts earlier on held interest, but it quickly turned into a steaming pile of s**t when Georgina escaped--completely ruined the movie with the last 20-30min. The acting was watchable, but it definitely felt like the actors were guessing for their next words, making it feel less than genuine, as holding the true face of the character and finding their way through sentences didn't seem to be a task this crew was set to manage with effective confidence in these scenes. I couldn't finished watching after she went back inside and am genuinely upset that I even started watching this. I don't write reviews for movies, and I don't get upset when they suck, but this was utter trash.",2023-01-07
"I was looking forward to watch this movie and actors. It started well with good acting but as soon the men beast appeared it went from mediocre to bad. I don't think it's a waste of time though.I was very engaged until I saw the creature. A horror movie with airbnb is great, monsters are not.I feel that the same movie with okupas (people that crush houses) instead of a weird creature would have enough for a completely different rate from my side. What a way to lose good actors and filming.If they re do it with no monsters, I would watch it ""again"".If you like monsters movies, you would like itNot me.",2023-01-01
"***NO SPOILERS***I was told before I watched ""Barbarian,"" to not watch any trailer, or read anything about it.""Looking at the poster is too much; just go see it now,"" my big time horror fan friend said. Then a co-worker said the same thing. ""Go see it after work, trust me."" He was also a big horror fan.""Wow! Two people who are horror fanatics recommend this movie to me. It has to be good!"" I thought.And ... it is, and it isn't.I loved the build up and release of the first act (if you're a horror fan, you'll love it too). I love the idea driving the second act (the acting is spot on). Richard Brake is superb, like always, in this.It's the third act where things go a little south. The writing is predictable, which is a surprise considering everything else was amazing and it's just not fun.The movie is entertaining and enjoyable, just the ending goes flat. The average movie goer won't notice or care, but for the fans, we noticed.",2022-11-07
"On the surface, this movie bills itself as a horror film but most horror movies I watch have no moral to the story and often lack happy endings. Barbarian cleverly takes the seemingly obvious monster and turns all of that on its head. I'd say this is the thinking-person's horror movie. The story is told extremely well. Pay attention to how the women navigate the entire film versus the men. For the first time, I actually smiled at the ending, because it was more about the plight of women and less about being truly scared. To those who watched this movie in the hopes it would be gratuitous violence or something else have missed the point. The title begs us to question, who's really the Barbarian? This movie makes for a great discussion afterwards.",2022-11-07
"I am a fan of deep and disturbing horror movies like: ""The Ring"" the recent release ""Smile"" and ""malignant"" as the last ones I can remember. The dude from IT who played Pennywise is in this film and his acting was superb. The main character I thought was logically sane.The movie starts off slow with a woman who rents out an Airbnb and meets the dude from IT. They are stuck in this house that appears normal but there is a dark secret in the basement.The movie is a moderately paced film with a a small intro story that leads into another story. Justin Long from ""Jeepers Creepers"" stars as the secondary main character in the second act. The acting, eeriness and music were excellent. The ending was brutal and disgustingly gory. The villain is a grotesque looking human that you have to see for yourself. Overall an amazing story with creepy music and climactic scenery. The ending was bizarre and suspenseful. I highly recommend it if you enjoy blood, guts and nasty images.",2022-10-03
"I really loved this movie's cinematography, and I also liked most of its tone and characters. For the first while of the movie I was really engaged, but then there's a certain point where it begins to spiral into strange decisions from both the characters and writers. I think I can pinpoint the exact point the movie starts to become odd, and it's when (as vague as I can describe it to avoid spoilers) a character gets shot in the gut. After that there's features like an emotional monologue that both comes out of and leads nowhere (unless there was some sort of metaphorical meaning to it), a straight up parody-style cliché death scene, and an ending that I feel is supposed to be meaningful but lacks the proper buildup.So that was pretty disappointing.But Keith was cool.",2022-11-01
"Discussing this movie without bringing up spoilers is actually really difficult, but I'm gonna try.It's atmospheric and stiflingly uncomfortable when it wants to be and funny when it wants to go that route instead, which is something I did not see coming. The scares are solid and the characters are well done with enough questions to keep you going.The closest comparison I have is Don't Breathe in its solid set up and presentation that has several missteps in the final third. It's not all bad in either case, and I probably prefer this resolution over Don't Breathes, but I feel like someone who likes one will at least enjoy the other.There are more than a few unbelievable moments in the finale along with inconsistencies that aren't enough to derail the production on their own, but, when put together, really add up to a lackluster resolution, that has just enough to keep your head above water.It's not a terrible conclusion. Just not as good as the preceding two thirds.Overall. Certainly good for at least one watch.Some may find it warrants a second.",2022-09-17
"They got me good.I really enjoyed this movie because it took me off guard. They were smart enough to mislead you with the trailer, because if I had known what this movie was going in, I definitely wouldn't have liked it as much.The casting in this movie was perfect. Georgina Campbell's really sold that average girl dropped into a nightmare scenario, Bill Skarsgard's performance had JUST the right amount of ""something's off"", Richard Brake has become one of my favorite character actors, and Justin Long stole the show.It was a movie that had me laughing out loud at one moment, and 2 seconds later I was turning the TV down for an intense, scary scene. That's a tough turn to make and they did it at break-neck speed. Not for everyone, but I really enjoyed it.",2022-11-04
"7.1/10? Really... i do not understand the appeal, why? Movie sucks big time. It had a strong start which I liked, some great acting from Bill Skarsgård, the only bright point of the movie. Besides that, movie is a illogical trainwreck. Horrible performance by Justin Long followed by underwhelming Georgina Campbell performance. Main plot of the movie was plainly and literally stupid. Also the movie is so dark it kills every bit of spooky atmosphere. Avoid watching this movie, you will not be missing anything and you will save yourself 90 minutes. Watching paint dry would be more worthwhile than losing time on this piece.",2022-10-31
"Barbarian shows Tess Marshall (Georgina Campbell) who travels to a rough part of Detroit for a job interview the next day, only to find that her AirBnb is double booked with Keith (Bill Skarsgard). The two of them stumble upon a hidden alley under the house, with all the secrets of the house that come with it.Okay, this movie was trash. Plot holes galore, sub par acting, a weird pace, and it didn't know what it wanted to be.Having said all that, it was a decent horror movie. I thought the movie effectively used the music and setting to portray a sense of dread. The house in question, the characters and even a bit of a backstory.It's something different and it it grips you to the end, decent horror.",2023-10-16
"So, I was waiting for this flick to show up online, hyped by YouTube movie critics positive reviews and high iMDb score, because 7.5 for horror movie is really high, and yesterday was the day to give it a look. Hype is not real with this one.From the start movie took wrong turn and direction. Many plot holes and bad irrational decisions, and even if you go past those for the sake of entertainment it's still bad. Maybe, just maybe, you can classify it into ""it's so bad it's good"" movie category, but no, it's just bad. It tries to be Evil Dead sometimes, but Evil Dead is on a different level. This movie is without identity, not scary enough, not funny enough, just real mess.To see this movie IMDb score just a smidge under Saw makes me roll my eyes so hard.",2022-10-26
"Looking at the reviews in IMDB, obviously the reviews are skewed towards positive side. While the movie starts off well, ultimately, it follows the same old cliche.The female protagonist was sensible in the first half of the movie with her decisions while in the second half she's reduced to a dumb girl in horror movie trope.The cops scene was totally unbelievable, even if you remove the scene, it won't matter to the story progression.The most unbelievable part was the ending where once again a cliche ending.Overall, an average movie among it's peers of the similar storyline with hopeful 1st half and below average 2nd half.",2022-10-31
"I was really impressed by this film, the cast and the effects.For starters the tension throughout (especially act 1) is *chefs kiss* it perfectly balances and leaves you guessing and leaves you unsettled from the get go.The acting performances throughout were great , Justin long especially did a fantastic job and it was nice to see bill skarsgard in another film.This films setting and theme was great and me and my partner definitely found ourselves tense and uncomfortable.This film balances its tension , gore and dark humour excellently and that in itself is a massive achievement.I'd definitely pay to see this again.",2022-10-30
"It's very *Psycho* with the house-as-evildoer's-psyche and that character's ""inner city"" portrayed as a cast of characters. That alone made it interesting enough to keep me watching to the end.It's scary enough without relying on cheap thrills. I generally dislike jump scares but there weren't enough to ruin my relationship with the movie.My only note after one casual viewing is the over-intellectualized/logical plot. The writer wasn't afraid to employ the supernatural/metaphysical/magical/whatever - e.g. The doors in the house - yet the movie dragged us out to a bar just to (I think?) feed us a crucial bit of exposition in dialogue. Also there was too much physics fighting for my taste. Again, this is something that usually precipitates my abandonment of a viewing, but there wasn't enough to bother me. Also the final fight was counter-logical enough to make it interesting. So I guess C+ on this issue - passing grade.I just had the idea that maybe it's better for everything to be ultra-logical outside the house; it's only with proximity to the... special feature of the house that things go all dreamy. IDK... that wasn't my feeling at the time, but maybe I will come to feel that way as I re-watch?I suppose this movie would be perfect for me if it were built on the physics engine of *Mulholland Drive* or *Holy Mountain* or some such.I really liked this movie and kept thinking about it all evening and into the next day. I will rent it when it is available via streaming. It will probably go into my rotation of Spooktober favorites - along with *Psycho*.",2022-10-18
"This movie is about colorblind people unable to see red flags everywhere, but I enjoyed it very much.The visuals, the intense build up towards something expectedly unexpected and the in-your-face uncomfortable atmosphere hits right if you are seeking a thrill.I love the casting too. They acted their parts in a way that makes you believe that their stories are going in a particular direction and then, you find yourself thinking that you shouldn't try to predict the trama.I don't know what else to say about the movie beyond the fact that it deserves a little more credit. Didn't watch it at first because of criticism. But now that I did, well... I think I was a bit foolish for letting myself fall for bad reviews.",2023-02-16
"What a wild ride.I genuinely hate this new ""600"" character minimum, because I wish that I could just simply tell you that this movie is crazy and you absolutely should give it a chance if you're into horror films, but now I have to really draw it out,
So I will say that you never know what is coming next with this film, when you start you think you have a subtle idea of what it may be about, but I promise you're wrong. There are so many twists and turns, with an ending that you'd need a crystal ball to see coming.Absolutely more than worth the watch, and should be on any true horror fans watchlist.",2023-01-18
"You don't have to agree with my 8 here. But there are reviewers here giving this much lower than it deserves. This is not a 1 star movie. Birdemic is a 1 star movie. And this is not Birdemic.Truth be told, I came into this movie completely unprepared. Saw it was marked ""New"" on HBO Max, clicked it and watched it. I genuinely had no idea what this movie was about. That will likely skew my score to being more favorable.Sure, there are a lot of loose ends in the movie, but I don't feel cheated or unfulfilled. It was immersive, thrilling, haunting, and creepy. The plots were clear enough, they just weren't wrapped up tightly in a bow at the end. I kinda think that's what makes this movie even creepier. There is a message in the movie if you want to read into it, but if you don't, it's fine. It doesn't beat you over the head with the message.The reviewers saying that it's unrealistic that all the hotels would be booked up due to a convention...I don't know what to tell you. Travel more for work? Because that happens in real life in certain cities. Or the remaining rooms are so scarce that they charge you some ridiculous price you can't afford. But even if you've never experienced this circumstance, it's such a weird thing to affect your rating.",2022-10-26
"I've started reading up on horror films slightly before watching as a result of watching a few really upsetting or depressing films (doesthedogdie is a really good site for this). I'd read the whole synopsis of this film a few weeks prior to watching and was pleasantly surprised! It completely surpassed my expectations and seemed like a few films in one.There are multiple actors in this film that I've seen before in other films or TV series, who blew me away.This doesn't feel like every other horror film ever released and had multiple layers to the story. My partner and I really enjoyed it.",2022-12-19
"I've never been in Detroit. We hear things in Europe, about the former city of cars being deserted, with outlaw reigning and all. Anyway, even without the harsh reality, this I think is a horror flick worth the while. I am not a horror fan myself, I used to like friday and freddy and chainsaw, but then I turned 14. This one however has it almost all: mystery, frightening moments without the sound engineer suddenly blasting the sound up to thunderstorm level, just for scare, but instead there was a story behind, and so nicely played by the actors, it didn't need big time character development. Basically, there are three different plots that are told in Pulp Fiction order (chronologically, the first one comes last). Then there's the fourth scene, uniteing all three initial strings, offering a pretty decent explanation and solution, with a tiny twist at the end. I mean, when at the end of a movie, you can't help but feel some slight sympathy even for the bad guy, that's, in my opinion a good movie. And, on top of it, it has a happy ending (you know, considering the carnage it underwent on its way there. Definitely worth a watch.",2023-02-07
"I'm totally frustrated by this film!!!7.2 rating are you sane people?!I'm a total fan of this genere, but THIS!It part 2 has a rating 6.5, well, in my point of view it's 10000 time better. Also this.director have two movies, one is 2009 comes and second one is this. Are you kidding me?A young woman discovers the rental home she booked is already occupied by a stranger. Against her better judgment, she decides to spend the night but soon discovers there's a lot more to fear than just an unexpected house guest.Not gonna recommend it EVER!!!At one point I started to get interest in this movie and that's why I gave it 2, not 1 :DDD.",2022-11-01
Started off kinda interesting and your like okay weird choice to go in the house with a stranger but it's cool then as the movie goes on and she makes the worst possible choices ever your like come on. Nobody with any common sense would make these choices and keep going back to this wack house with the unknown man the creepy noises at night and the abandoned neighborhood. Then of course she finds the creepy tunnels and finally decides hey I'm gonna head out but no she is stopped and of course unknown man goes into the creepy tunnels and get captures very typical and what does she do idk leave and call the police no she goes after him and then gets captured. She continues to make bad decisions so many I can't even write about them all and the movie is just kinda frustrating and weird and not in a good way.,2023-01-01
"Fantastic pacing, acting and cinematography. Good, truly unpredictable scares. It is a rare movie that successfully misleads on the direction of the plot as well.It sticks with you.Note that the movie started as a short story about a woman being overwhelmed with red flags. An exercise in creating as many as possible.Does it have the classic horror trope of people doing extremely unreasonable, self-destructive things time and time again? Absolutely. Does the math on the successive generations of inbreeding make sense? Absolutely not.Note that there is a certain sensitive portion of the population that gets upset when a male is portrayed as a predator (these people have a 1:1 overlap with getting upset about the skin color of a mermaid or elf). This movie has several of them, and is being brigaded for that reason.",2022-10-29
"This disturbing film brings even the most casual viewer to disgust. Not because the movie was bad, because it was genuinely a good watch, but because of some of the disturbing scenes in this film. Barbarian starts with what you might think is a psychological horror about a possible creepy roommate, which then turns into a sort of creature movie with some hidden evil characters thrown within. This film will have you thinking you know what the movie is really about and then completely change what you think in another scene and I personally think that's what makes this film such an interesting watch. This film is an enjoyable creature feature-esque with some hidden jumpscares you couldn't predict, definitely worth the watch.",2023-10-31
"This movie showed some promise in the beginning. The story line was looking good, then it all took a twist for the worse not to mention cliche. Now, I don't mean another-monster-cliche kinda deal. I've seen my share of great movies bun can we stop trying to create some unreal plot where people escape their demise then their turn around and go back into it? Just saying.Also, can we stop trying to involve police and then have them act like whatever they're going through isn't important and they're better off going to investigate something else rather than a potential murder and kidnapping case??? Cmon.",2022-10-28
"Before watching the film I saw the trailer which shows all the rave reviews it's gotten and how scary it is. I'd say there was one decent jump scare, the others pretty much missed for me and honestly the whole concept of this decrepit, tall old scary lady trying to be a mom to these captive people was hilarious to me, not really very scary. For that reason the film was still entertaining. I found it odd that some of our protagonists are abruptly and suddenly killed, plus I would have expected more of the movie to be about them trying to escape the cellar, and it being difficult to do so but the opposite was the case for both. The film also ends right upon our main protagonist shooting the crazy creepy lady in the head. The film is straight to the point.",2023-07-09
"I remember the film having a really good vibe throughout that kept me guessing what's going to happen next. The protagonist and subsequent monsters were well written and acted out and I feel like i could suggest this film to newbies of horror but not those who have done a lot of jump scares.However i don't remember much from the latter half of the film so I might watch it again. Which doesn't mean that it was bad, but that it wasn't exactly a memorable experience.The setup starts slow but by the end of the movie, its almost like another genre of horror. Some folks don't seem to enjoy the change but I did.",2023-07-12
"Look, I was really excited about this movie. The beginning had a good set up and reeled me in. The tension started building and when that moment came, I was truly unexpectedly surprised. I did not expect that. I got excited for the rest of the movie. Then the scene switches to another character and it drags. I found myself getting distracted and suddenly all my interest started to leave me. Soon the 'surprise' came back and I found myself like ""okay finally we're getting creepy again"". That went away fast. It just became weird and then stupid. Gross and then laughable. The explanation was further ridiculous and made no sense. Then the movie proceeded with a bunch of unrealistic events, especially the police encounter that was just pathetic really. Soon the threat became nearly comically bad and the ending was just stupid.Why was the movie called Barbarian? Don't know. Just something to add to the long list of things that didn't make sense or are explained in this movie. Watch with friends to laugh at it and have something ridiculous to talk about after. Comedy should be added to the genre type.-Spoiler-You're telling multiple inbred children created a superhuman creature that is fast, can take a lot of damage, and is a super strong? Also, she suddenly is fast enough to leap off a building to catch the main girl to save her before she hits the ground? The creature becomes a superhero and she just wants loves and cares about the girl? Then the girl just shoots her? The end?? I'm sorry but nothing in this movie makes sense and it should be a comedy. Everyone in the movie is also an imbecile and lacks any sort of common sense or situational awareness. I found myself not caring about any of them.",2022-10-26
"This film was a surprise for me. I did not know what to expect at all. My initial thought from the trailer was thrown out the window by the end of this film. The story was well written with a message that was unexpected. I found myself totally wrapped into this film as it flowed without me losing interest.I would definitely recommend this film. The cast had great chemistry from start to finish. Whether if you saw it on the big or small screen, I believe this film will leave you with several thoughts and questions.Another thing that I would like to add is that I believe this is one of those hidden gems of a film.",2022-12-20
"This film was one hell of a ride. I have never seen a horror movie blend genuine suspense (not cheap thrills), with compelling characters, and raw untamed comedy so well. The film is basically broken up into 4 acts: intro/justin long sucks/prologue/finale. And the cathartic release in the finale-for a character who has given up so much, not trusted by the cops, thrown into a delirious situation, thrown off a silo by a rapist to achieve freedom was rewarding. And the weird connection between the Mother and Tess at the end was beyond compelling.The suspense that is built is executed perfectly; the horror and the gore was wicked. The description of the situation (weird guy tortures women and creates a monster, a loving monster, but a monster nonetheless). I'm still thinking about whether the Mother only attacks bad people, for example: I still don't get why the Mother won't kill Tess, but would kill both Keith and AJ (and the homeless man). Is Keith a bad guy? (Also, the intrigue generated around Keith-is he gonna lure Tess into a trap was insane). I don't want to read too much into this film. But, it was bonkers. A gory gleefest; and I'm happy AJ got his messed up head messed up.This film energizes the cinephile.",2022-09-23
"Well damn. Really didn't expect it to be this good. Wanted to give my support to what I believed would ultimately be a forgettable movie but wow, what a surprise.I do wanna say to any potential new viewer: Don't go in expecting a ""The Shining"" or ""Rosemary's baby"" type of movie, I think it'll affect your enjoyment of the film. There are story elements here that do feel déjà vu, but what carries it is the overall execution and the way the story is told. This movie never tries to be any more than what it is, which is just an extremely well done horror movie. It respects the audience and creates a genuily very creepy atmosphere at times.10/10 recommended. You won't be dissapointed, this is one of the best major releases this year.",2022-09-12
"I should have seriously saved my money and watched it at home. I am surprised my wrestles legs did not kick in. What a waste of a good cast. Not sure what exactly this movie was about or why it was even made. They should have organized their thoughts well before filming. Then the end 🙄 I was expecting something else. Anything other than what I saw a ghost would have been better. They said from the people that made It so yes it makes perfect sense it's something of a clown movie. Who knows, it has potential but it went all over the place. The middle of the movie was like WTF where are we now and then the flashback... Gosh.",2022-09-17
"I went to see this movie with some friends and I was super excited. I hadn't seen a horror movie in theaters for a long time and the trailer for this movie had me excited. It starts strong when two of the main characters are forced to share their rental house due to a double booking(I'm assuming, it's never confirmed). This part of the movie is very strong. It's creepy and you're never sure of what's going to happen next. Is Keith crazy? Is he going to hurt Tess? Tess and Keith soon discover a hidden passage in the basement and their tense exploration is cut short by a violent head bashing. This is where the movie peaks before going into a free fall in terms of quality. The tension is immediately broken by a sequence about some new character named AJ who is accused of rape. AJ's character was so unnecessary and his inclusion completely hurts the pacing and tone of the movie. Many of AJ's scenes are played for laughs when the movie is supposed to be tense and scary. It breaks all immersion and really makes it hard to take the film seriously as a horror film. By the end I just felt like the writers has too many ideas and just tried to cram them all in. The movie ends up feeling like a weird combination of Creep and The Hills Have Eyes and it just doesn't work at all. In the end the movie suffers from bad pacing, a tone that is all over the place, and a disappointing lack of decent scares. Would not recommend, save your money!",2022-10-08
"Finally a horror film with suspense, great character building and sense of what next...Then the second half gets underway and you feel like another director has stepped in. Justin long is great but I can't help but feel he doesn't belong here. His comedic approach is more suited to his previous roles in Jeepers Creepers and Tusk. There are pointless segments of the film that in hindsight are irrelevant to the story. I haven't left the cinema in a long time feeling so disappointed for a film that started with great promise and then finish as a run of the mill monster movie. Poor ending. Sloppy even. My score reflects the first half only.",2022-11-05
"So, I didn't know anything about this movie before I watched it, which is the best way to watch it. There are no spoilers here.I read that there are three major horror movies this year. Barbarian, Smile and Halloween ends. Barbarian, is by far the better of the three. It is something that the other two are not, which is original - and a little disturbing.I have just written a review on Smile, and purposely ended that review stupidly and disappointingly - because Smile is both of those things. Barbarian is everything Smile is not. I'll say it again - it's original, and it's creepy and the twists are real twists.I don't like to set out what happens in my reviews - I could waste yours (and my) time talking about a women who rents a house, goes for a job interview, shares the house and loads of next stuff happens.. And, how the movie just keeps twisting and turning... but I won't. Watch the movie.The only let down - the ending. Although it sort of fits, it's almost as if the writers and director ran out of ideas of how to end the movie. They had set the movie out so well - sometimes the ending just trickles out with a whimper, because the rest of the movie is so great.8/10. Good job.",2022-11-03
"Unease underlies The First Act of Barbarian. It's so effective because it's realistic. Initially, the film depends on the human interactions between Tess (Georgina Campbell) and Keith (Bill Skarsgård). The scenario this pair find themselves in is quite irregular; an Airbnb Home situated in Detroit's decaying suburbia is being rented to either one at the same time. Keith, who'd arrived prior to Tess, convinces her to stay the night, since it's pouring rain out and Brightmoor has clearly seen better days. And nights. Skarsgård plays Keith just a little off-key, enough to make the audience question his true nature. Perhaps he's the titular barbarian... There'S even a few visual hints, such as the camera lingering on an innocent cup of tea he's prepared for Tess. Has he drugged it? We can't know. Therefore, every little exchange of dialogue he shares with Tess feels suspenseful. You're waiting for some horrific slippage of character. But nah. He's just a normal guy, and after some obvious reluctance, Tess actually seems to hit it off with him, as most young people do. It's cute. We're invested because both actors have played it totally straight; compliments of the screenplay. This is how two rational human beings would react given the circumstances. When the two eventually go to sleep, Tess is awoken in the middle of the night by Keith's disturbing and inarticulate vocalisations. He's probably having a bad dream, or perhaps, his subconscious can sense the evil lurking behind the basement door, which mysteriously hangs ajar...Barbarian eventually descends into a somewhat lesser work of popcorn horror, though these opening scenes genuinely prevail as something more. At the end of the First Act, intentionally echoing Psycho (1960), Keith, who we've assumed to be the protagonist (as Janet Leigh was) is viscously attacked and murdered by this film's monster: an unspeakable, nightmarish and grotesquely inbred woman. The film then detours to Justin Long's character, AJ, cruising down the West Coast in a slick sports car, singing along to 'Heat of the Moment' by Asia. AJ gets a call from his agents in Hollywood, informing him that a female co-star will be accusing him of sexual misconduct. Long plays the shock and confusion very well. Writer-director Zach Cregger shifts and reapplies horror from the monstrous archetype to a terrifying real-world scenario. Really smart. By the end of the film, Cregger suggests that AJ is in fact irredeemable, based on his selfish actions through gruesome tribulations in Brightmoor. AJ probably did sexually assault that co-star of his, though receives an ironic, difficult-to-watch comeuppance, when he's forced to suck the teat of the inbred woman. Justin Long is, ordinarily, a comedic actor, and the movie's actually really funny too. I love the bit when he's drunkenly explaining his version of events, regarding his female co-star, to a jackass friend at some bar in downtown Detroit. Or when he's so desperate to sell his cursed property, that he's oblivious to the frightful catacombs beneath, measuring them with tape to eventually advertise their total surface area online.Again, to clarify the film's slight undoing at the finale... I guess everything beforehand just felt so cool, so fresh, that to see it revert to a more standardised horror in the closing minutes was a little unfortunate. The titular barbarian, played effectively by Richard Brake, who I've only ever seen in Batman Begins (2005), gets a flashback scene. It's shot as if we're following him in the third-person. Interesting, visually. It also drops some clues on all the revelations that'll make sense to us later, not to mention there's a wise hobo who'll further elaborate to the main characters on what's really going on... But none of that hits the same level of intrigue, creepiness and engaging reality of the opening, where it's all resting on Bill Skarsgård and Georgina Campbell's shoulders. That's great filmmaking. Jaws (1975) put its characters before the shark, and for a good little chunk, Barbarian (2022) actually seems to be doing the same. Maybe that's enough these days...The fact that A24, a company well-known for producing risky films, refused to back the project is also noteworthy. This is the kind of stuff we need more of in Hollywood right now... Barbarian is such a great film to watch with friends; truly worth that cinema experience of yesteryear.",2023-03-16
"Tropes tropes tropes! Holy tropes! There are so many tropes in this movie, but I ate it up like candy. Like the cover art of the movie shows, one of the most classic shots in horror movies is the basement shot. The character is seen at the frame of the door, looking down into the dark basement in trepidation. And of course, the character is always going to venture further! This movie does this not once, nor twice, but three times! It was fairly nauseating, like indulging in some candy, but they just kept venturing further down the basements of this house. And the further the characters ventured on, the more I was lured into the suspense of the movie. I kinda loved it, but like eating candy, at some point I had had enough. I swear, they did the trope of someone dropping a flashlight/weapon four or five separate times and the ending was a little unsatisfying, like I had a stomach ache from eating too much candy. I wish they expanded a little more on the backstory of the father and monster too, but I guess somethings are better left untouched, like an Almond Joy. But enough of the critiques! Let's get to the sweet parts!The suspense that builds at the beginning of the movie between Bill Skarsgard and Georgina Campbell is incredible. To get the guy who played It the Clown to play an actual good guy in this movie is genius! And Justin Long's character is so hilarious, the tropes he's fated to commit are still satisfyingly digestible when he eventually succumbs to them. I know I'm going to revisit this movie when I get a craving for it, dare I say, like a candy craving. But enough of the jokes! This movie is a thrill ride, that I'd recommend to any who's a fan of this genre or even potential new fans who are curious to step into that dark basement. Now let's eat some candy!",2022-10-16
"Spoiler alert:
This movie actually made me mad. It is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life and I'm not even joking.It's one nonsensical choice after another and no context to at least make us relate to them a little bit, lots of plots that were hinted but that were never really developed and therefore no build up or anything. The supposed monster (mama) was revealed to easily and the evilness of the true monster (Justin Long) was not well explored. There were so many opportunities and roads to take that could make this such a better movie but they were simply not taken.",2023-10-29
"This movie was well acted and had a fun storyline. You spend the first half of the movie thinking one thing is inevitably going to happen, only for it to to go in a COMPLETELY different direction. The casting of Bill Skaarsgard, if you have seen him in IT, was definitely a good way to throw people for a loop. I don't want to give any spoilers away. Viewers will just have to watch and see.The film was creative and you almost think you are watching a second movie in the second half. Justin Long becomes the focus somewhat in the second half, and he nails the douche-type actor role down to a tee.",2022-11-13
"Nicely made horror movie, it starts slow but it's worth the wait. The movie is very well made to the point that you think you're being led to an specific type of horror movie and !!boom! It Takes you in some other direction that you didn't even expected. It's very well directed, it has gore, it has tension, jump scares, the actors did a very nice job specially justin long , if you see the movie with out watching the trailer or anything about it like I did you'll definitely get a very nice surprise. They did a very fine job setting up all the tension moments. The movie will get you entertained and if you like horror movies this is a MUST!!!",2022-10-26
I absolutely love horror films and this one received so much praise that I couldn't wait to watch it. I feel betrayed. This movie was long and slow. I don't mind movies that start slow if they get good but this movie is not that. The beginning had promise and then it all went downhill. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen but it's pretty low on the totem pole. I liked the acting so that is a plus! I just dont understand how people vould say this was a scary movie. What scene scared people? I truly cant figure out what scene was scary throughout the whole movie. Overall a waste of time for me. I don't recommend if you like horror.,2022-10-27
"TRIGGER WARNING (r@pe)!!! I haven't seen anyone talk about the actual subject matter of this movie. Deals with strong themes of r*pe. The movie talks about and shows r*pe. If this is something that might be triggering to you I would not recommend seeing it as it was difficult to watch at times. Movie also was not scary and had a lot of plot holes. I had really high hopes for this movie and was very disappointed. If you're into disturbing then this might be the movie for you, but I still would not recommend spending money to see it. The movie had a very long set up that didn't feel necessary. If you like weird horror movies this might be for you, but if you're more into the slasher horror movies you might want to pass on this one. I know this might be an unpopular opinion as people have been raving about this movie, but I wanted people to get an understanding of what ""dark subject matter"" this movie actually deals with.",2022-09-12
"I honestly don't know what I even watched. The premise of the story at the beginning was pretty smart which is what got me into watching this film in the first place, but boy did I make a mistake. The story was messy and made no sense. And they threw in a story line near the end that also makes no sense?? Maybe I'm missing something but please don't watch this movie. Maybe this is a good film for putting on in the background while your doing something else but nothing more than that. I wish I could make sense of what the hell I just watched but I truly can't. Don't waste your time with this movie!!! I was fooled by the good reviews.",2022-11-06
"It started up great, i mean the tension in the first act was off the roof. We were made to expect there's something ominous about keith. But he's soo normal as far as his appearance in the movie.and i have a sympathy for him, and they build a great chemistry together. And tess was that one protagonist that we all hope for in a horror movie, she's careful, and aware of everything. And even after hell break loose she's very rational about it and the first thing she wants to do is runaway, until keith insist that he wants to go check on it himself. And that's when it all went downhill. The whole premise of AJ's story is kinda remind me of the American horror story series, in-fact this whole movie is like a pilot of american horror stories.Again, as i said it has a very promising opening. The details of precaution she took, the details of creepy stuff was great.but then it took a bad turn. I just don't know why people said it was good. It was alright at best.Such a waste for Skarsgård.",2022-11-14
"Basically no one wants to call the police all movie except one time and it all makes sense because when they actually show up... they suck and tbh how they handle the situation is extremely realistic lol. Movie has bits and pieces of comedy here and there which makes you laugh also it has a couple scenes that make you jumó haha so that's awesome, I would say this movie get around a 7 anyone else giving it higher is full of it. I don't watch horror movies often this one was just scary enough for my taste. Overall movie is entertaining, would not call it scary but pretty entertaining. Give it a go this halloween and I think you will enjoy it!",2022-10-29
"Not only is the title completely misleading, but the whole story is far-fetched. And, even if it was partly quite nice, the whole film is just boring until the bitter end.What disturbs me the most, however, is once again the representation of a man who is called by a woman for sexual harassment and yes... of course the man is guilty!Just strange, if a man would claim this to a woman, everyone would laugh! What a BS!About the film:
I sat there for the first half hour wondering, what's this all about? After the first character was killed, it became confusing. The background story was only just touched upon and you had to figure out the rest.",2022-11-05
"I don't get the hype surrounding this film. Despite some well known actors, the movie seemed about as well-written as your average Shudder or IFC feature. It had a few tense moments early on, where you were wondering what was going on, but ultimately the reveal was just weird, nothing more. Generally, these were not characters you were invested in at all, which makes certain portions of the film uninteresting and even unappealing. Honestly, I think you're better off going into this one, knowing a little about what you're in for, despite what everyone says. That way, you won't be so disappointed and you might be able to just appreciate it as a ""not bad"" way to kill 90 mins if you happen to be in the right mood.",2022-10-26
"I went into this having seen all the reviews saying ""scariest movie in years"" and so on. Was it scary? Yes. Was it scariest I've seen? Not even close, and I'm only a casual horror movie fan. To start with, this polar opposite of a slasher horror movie like Scream, and more of a tense/suspense movie. I told my wife (who did not want to see it) that if you take the suspense from the recent Invisible Man movie and facets of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you'd have a good idea what you're going to see with Barbarian. Only Barbarian isn't nearly as violent as TCM and is somewhat scarier and MUCH darker than Invisible Man! To me, the movie might've been too short for what it could've accomplished, but it seemed to go out of its way to include some useless material that was never elaborated on. The movie started to develop some depth to the story, but just stopped suddenly. I could absolutely see there being a prequel to this that, if done right, could be much better than this movie. Parts were WAY too far fetched for me, but outside of that and the rabbit holes, this was a good attempt at a scary and intense movie! 6/10.",2022-09-11
"The police were by far the scariest characters: arrogant, narcissistic, thick headed total waste of space ie absolute realism.The monster was a John Cleese lookalike in zombie drag, so I found her/it/they quite humorous in many ways.The scenario was very realistic and it bludgeoned us with the philosophical debate about ""what is evil"".I found many online reviews used red herrings for some reason. False spoliers you could say.There was a lot of very clever photography and character nuance. A door could appear utterly threatening just be being placed at the correct angle for the right amount of time; or a face could appear ambiguous by the director with great artistic ease.",2022-10-23
"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie so I went to a matinee by myself. Only two teens in the theatre other than myself...not sure if it's the end of run soon or just the matinee time on a weekday.The beginning half hour was leading to a classic thriller horror leading you in one direction, only to find out a bot later that you cant leap to conclusions. After the first set of characters were absorbed into the plot, a second single character rode out the second half of the movie. The second character ultimately meets one of the first characters in dealing with the ""horror"" aspect and you discover the filler story for what is going on.This movie reminded me of a Friday night movie on TV..very mild humour, almost no jump scares, a storyline you can forsee easily and absolutely nothing original. The ending made me groan and the two teens laugh as they said ""really?""
No spoilers here...not much to spoil. Some of the sets were good and those scenes were probably the best part of the whole movie. I dont know how I got sucker punched here but this was a waste of an afternoon. Wait for the streaming release if you must.",2022-10-07
"Starts off really quite promisingly. Georgina Campbell and Bill Skarsgard work well and even though the premise is a bit... lazy... they have good chemistry and play off each other well-enough to be believable.There's some good aesthetics, nothing too adventurous, but it's a pretty competent horror whilst these two are on screen and some unexpected moments that are effective.In the second half of the film Justin Long turns up... maybe I've seen him play too many dislikable characters to filter it - or he's just dislikable in general, but the film takes a serious downturn with his arrival. Moves into a lazy and fairly badly done Hill Have Eyes shtick and takes a huge nosedive in terms of sfx - right at the point it needs them - it just starts to look cheap and stupid.Not sure what happened with this, definitely worth a look, but not a 2nd time.",2022-11-08
"Im really shocked at how many scathing reviews there are on here, I really enjoyed this film a lot. From what I've seen it seems like people are upset at a few things: 1. The characters make dumb choices
2. The movie wasn't particularly scary
3. The plot lacks cohesion
I want to respond to all 3 of these because I really think they are all without merit.First, the characters do make dumb choices in some instances, but a very important distinction to make is that their dumb choices make sense for their character. - AJ needs to make money on this house, and he's shown to be pretty stupid anyways, so him going down the tunnel was just funny to me and I liked the way they got him down there.Tess is consistently kind to a fault. She does dodge many horror story tropes by somewhat setting up failsafes for herself, but she can't overcome her good nature when someone else is in dangerThe cops were shown early on to be unreliable in this neighborhood, so their actions made sense to meSecond, yeah the movie certainly isn't very scary. But as soon as the jump cut happened after Keith's death, it was obvious to me that this movie wasn't really intending to bank everything on scares. The movie is very character driven, which is rare for horror movies. I like the way another review put it, saying the movie is about the relationship between men and women and when to trust somebody. Tess was skeptical of Keith due to male stereotypes, but was wrong about him. As a result she doesnt assume that AJ matches those stereotypes, even though he does. AJ sees a man deep in a dungeon behind an unlocked door and immediately assumes he is captive there. I like how the movie plays on our preconceived notions and makes us question whether each new character will match them. In short, I felt the movie had much more to chew on than its horror, which also wasnt even that bad.Lastly some people have said the plot was a mess, which I dont really understand. I felt like it was pretty simple, which maybe is the issue people have? If thats the case, I don't think it's an issue. I had guessed where the movie was going by about the halfway point and I still enjoyed it a lot. Simple does not mean bad.Edit: I've also seen a few people asking why the movie is called Barbarian, and I'm pretty sure it's because the house is on Barbary street, making the mother, who lives there, a ""Barbarian"", or maybe its referring to her father. Either way, that's why. Even if it made no sense I don't see why that would impact a rating.",2023-01-14
"This movie was a wild ride from start to finish. With engaging characters, and a creative plot - this movie had me hooked the entire time. Regarding other reviews, I definitely understand why some people were thrown off by the change of pacing and vibe.The first arc has such a fantastic, atmospheric feel to it that was truly horrifying, and to switch gears the way it was quite jarring. But that's precisely what I loved about it.I appreciated all the variety of elements it had from the beginning creepy tension, to campy comedy, to creature thriller. I also thought it did a good job conveying its message (regarding Justin Long's character), it did so with a tongue-in-cheek approach which made it so it wasn't overly preachy.With so many cookie-cutter horror flicks this one brought something fun and attention grabbing to the table. I'm definitely going to rope my non-horror friends into watching this one.",2022-11-17
"First of all I knew nothing about the movie. Just the beginning basic plot. What I did know is I read multiple times what an experience it is supossed to be and the love it got from the audiences.What i found? A very decent movie, nicely shot, with stunning actors and very fun to watch. It has nothing we've never seen before dozen of times with different mixtures, just perhaps in a modern ""envelop"" or the fact it's presented in a particular pace or manner.Is it bad? Nope, it's enjoyable and very fun as I stated.Is it that good? I don't think it's the genre hit saviour I heard/read. Felt a bit disappointed because the good critics and the way they're ""selling"" it. I thought it was going to be a whole different movie. But nothing to do with its quality, wich is good, as I say. Just a matter of non-reached expectations.",2022-10-29
"It has its fair amount of cliches (dumb characters making dumb decisions to keep the script going otherwise the movie would've been over in 20 minutes)Good music, decent acting, some genuinely good scares and creepy imagery that will stick with you, practical sets and makeup / gore, as far as I can tell - almost no cgi (which is huge these days), good music, cinematography and the lighting was particularly great.I recommend to people like myself who enjoy above average horror movies such as ""it follows"" and ""hereditary"".DO NOT READ AHEAD IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN:Flaws :-characters losing weapons
-police being stupid and useless
-somehow this monster is able to kill god knows how many people and wanders around at night and has never been reported on (if it was confined to the house I would understand)
-I can buy that since it's located in a nearly abandoned ghetto that the Detroit police will undoubtedly believe that when bunch of people that say there's a monster in the basement they will assume they are crackheads (which is funny itself) and when this actually happened when she confronts the two cops I laughed my ass off xDPros :-I like how Keith was just an innocent goober who was a red herring (fresh off of IT you expect him to be the killer and he even says ""what do I look a monster?""
-the synthy music was great along with the cool lighting to make it feel kind of 70's/80's inspired
-practical make up and prosthetic monster suit is always a plus. I always prefer when there's a creative team that designs a monster (even though the ""hag"" type of monster has been done to death in recent years starting with the Spanish film ""Rec"" I believe, rather than ""we don't show the monster because we couldn't design something scary""",2023-10-01
"I watched this movie due to the positive reviews it has received. At first, I thought it was a normal thriller movie with a girl staying in AirBnB and the host is probably crazy or something. However, halfway through the movie, it turns out there is a monster which looks like the female version of the movie hachet.I thought this movie has 2 parts but turns out the 2 parts are connected. It has some elements of comedy but mostly horrors. The gore is satisfying to watch. However, more background about the monster is appreciated. I don't know how it got there and why it behaves that way. Perhaps there will be Barbarian 2 coming soon :)",2022-12-23
"Hard to fathom the previous rating on this. Solid start and setup but spirals into absolute rubbish in the second half. It's as if the directors and writers started with a good idea, ran out of steam halfway through and then asked ChatGPT to finish off the plot using some of the most commonly used plot ""twists"" from horror movies.Well acted by Campbell and Skarsgard - Justin Long obviously commanded the majority of the budget that should have gone to writers and art directors - leading to the filth that was delivered in the end. Perhaps a tactic from the studio in order to try carry the film through box office.",2023-05-20
"This film couldnuave been so much better. Great setting and very claustrophobic, especially when walking through the underground tunnel . The shadowy horrible thing moving about in the distance creates a good.horror ambience. It's almost like a modern take on.sawney bean without the cannibalism. Turns out there had been an attempt at inbreeding but there.deosnt seem to be any y survivers. My main gripe about this movie was the last 30 mins. Police totally disbelieve a credible story from thr main.female character and don't even step.foot on the house, even though she had been staying.there and would have allowed access. The clown hay couldn't hold a gun without dropping it . And the abrupt ending ,it really was poor. But apart from that it wasn't the worst.",2022-10-30
"Justin Long and Bill Skarsgård are the best part of this movie. Bill's character could definitely be in another movie, like a love movie. He's so endearing and thoughtful. Unfortunately this movie was lame, 44 minutes until some ""scary"" action happens. Some scene didn't need to be in it unless the point was drag the story out. The ""scary"" character seems like a costume like character from halloween themepark nights, anyone could put that suit on. The girl from the beginning was cool, just doesn't make sense she was ""down there"" don't understand the time lapse how long she was ""stuck"". Not great.",2022-10-27
"This movie.. it feels like two separate movies by two separate directors going in opposite directions. Both have promise but not together.But I did not guess on that I'd feel a small tear when the woman said baby and showed such compassion in the end. She's not a monster but her father is. Through extensive inbreeding and god knows what more this is probably not to far of from what you'd get if it DID happen.She probably couldn't get a baby because she was so destroyed from the birth and this made two things become issues;
One; daddy won't get more ways for inbreeding.Two; It is probably the only thing she wants. Dad has probably tried her through her life and she might feel like that's the only purpose she has. Broken both physically and mentally from the start.I wish there was a good ending for her sooner.",2023-01-03
"The first half is exciting, turning really scary, and except for never explaining why a woman traveling alone for a job interview would rent lodgings in such a decrepit, godforsaken part of town, draws us into the whole scary house formula. There is a really nerve-jangling ten minutes in the basement when we discover the evil presence. Then there is a clever shift to the story of the house's owner, and his unscheduled visit to his rental property. It is only at the halfway point that things start to go astray, as we begin to see the script become way too involved with injecting current social issues into the material. Justin Long is a fine actor, but the script uses him in a heavy-handed way to be an example of toxic masculinity: both as an abusive boyfriend AND an absentee landlord in an abandoned neighborhood. It also becomes clear that the root of all this community's woes lies in the affluent whites who fled their suburban ideal town decades before. A career serial killer and his offspring are the wretched inhabitants that terrify those unlucky enough to visit the house in the present. A horror movie seems like a distasteful platform to use for preaching serious moral and social issues. Reminiscent of other recent thrillers more intent on giving us a lesson than in giving us excellent horror - thinking especially here of ""Antlers"" and ""The Cursed."" Still, most of this is quite effective, and if you're not troubled by the contemporary messaging, you'll probably enjoy it a lot.",2022-09-21
"People that are shredding the ending sound like they have never watched a Horror Movie before, and like they don't truly appreciate the genre. If you are a Horror fan, there will be something here for you and you will get the tonal shifts, changes in story direction and the subtext. After all, as any true Horror fan knows, these films are metaphors and symbols of something deeper in society, and in the human psyche. People that get caught up in looking for logical explanations miss the point and can't see the forest for the trees. Horror movies are intentionally surreal and fantastic, and through this cinematic device we can explore freely themes that other types of genres would never allow. Anyway, this has tension, great acting, suspense, is beautifully shot and has some moments of true Horror. It also has a sense of humor, which is necessary in a Horror film to break up the tension, and some of the reviews here erroneously think this is unintentional. Clearly, to anyone that understands the history of Horror cinema, it is not. It is best watched knowing as little as possible of the plot...so stop reading and start watching! Underneath the roller coaster ride there are some real things to think about in regards to gender, trust, selfishness, misogyny and more...but you can also just enjoy this for what it is on the surface: a thrill ride that understands the art of the slow burn (the climb up the roller coaster is sometimes the scariest part, after all) and delivers the shocks and scares. Check it out.",2022-11-01
"Well written, great at building and using tension, one of the best horror movies of the last few years.The story is very simple, but still makes you curious and waiting for what's gonna happen next. The origin story of the ""monster"" is surprisingly interesting and makes sense. It's absolutely crazy and built of some horrible incidents, that are portayed in really convincing way.Characters are pretty interesting and manage to escape from some iritating horror clichè.Finally, when the movie gets scary, it really is scary. Scary and disgusting.So now, after all of this advantages, there's one question you probably want to ask. How is the rating so ""low""? Well... The ending.That's what drags this movie down. The ending, the last about 20 minutes. Just when you thought ""Barbarian"" managed to escape clichè and do something overally interesting and pretty original, you get slaped in the face by it's third act. One of the greatest disappointments I felt this year...",2022-12-12
"There are some few issues with this film. First of all it seems to have a false start, where a woman that rented out an BnB in a very questionable part of town in Detroit and that too being the only house in the area that is still intact amid a largely abandoned and ruined town, only to find that it has been occupied by some another person that claims to be a BnB customer himself. Thus starts an uneasy arrangement between two strangers and the awkwardness of trust that one of them isn't an unhinged lunatic with hidden intentions in a house with its own deep dark secrets underneath.The build up was great up to this point till the movie cuts away and starts all over again this time with an actor suddenly finding out he is being sued for sexual scandal witih one of his co-workers and is at the brink of losing his livelihood as all of his movie deals are suddenly put on hold. Having to recoup funding for the upcoming lawsuit against him, the actor finds himself visiting one of his properties and the only standing house in an abandoned, decrepit town in Detroit. Where he finds the house to have a deeper secret than being being the only livable structure in the entire town.It felt like the writers couldn't decide which introduction to stick with and decided to use them both. While this isn't an uncommon tactic, the sudden reset squanders the intensity that was already built up in the fist act. Thankfully, both them are well written enough that I still found myself invested in how things connect. Although frankly, the first act although good could have been a part of a different movie. The reveal of the houses' deep dark secret is equal parts surprising and a little bit disappointing as it pivots to an entirely different genera after setting up an intense situation about trusting strangers. Still though, the acting and direction was decent enough that you will have an entertaining ride to the end, despite the leaps in logic with some of the reveals. This could have been a lot worse if both intros were not well executed luckily both of them were pretty interesting that I was fine with going with it.",2022-11-28
"I see that all the hype about this movie is about its unpredictability. Which is true till the moment when you see the bosom of the ""monster"".Up until that moment I actually thought it was a huge conspiracy involving a mutant population beneath the once peaceful and idyllic suburbia that the local government and police knew about and kept it under the rug. Never mind, none of that.The moments when the movie transitions from horror to personal problems of the director/screenwriter/whatever the guy was was pretty funny got to admit.But for people that are familiar with horrors/thrillers this will be very predictable and kind of goofy to be honest.Also this movie is probably inspired by Josef Fritzl. Check that real life nightmare of a story out.",2022-10-27
"I'm a huge horror movie fan, especially in October. We held off watching this until Halloween weekend as we thought it was going to be a classic and scary in some kind of innovative way.Sadly, we could barely keep it on. No human would do anything this woman did and unfortunately that was at the core of why this was just stupid :(.Not sure where the title came from either as it had no relevancy to the movie.There was also a huge unanswered question that was never answered or eluded to again and not in a 'oohh I wonder what that meant' thought.... no... more like a writer had an idea, it was mentioned as critical in the movie.... and then forgotten.And to waste the talents of Justin Long and Bill Skarsgård in a movie that doesn't have the depth to support their abilities.... I just don't understand HOW this has such high ratings :(",2022-11-01
"The start is really good, creates a very strong tension (and such a big promise) by so little means, but then it becomes some sort of melodrama / social commentary. Uses popular social politics tropes to buy ratings. E.g. All men in the movie are either piece of trash or brutally murdered or both; the strong and powerful protagonist is obviously a woman of color. Not that it's a problem, but if you came to see a horror movie and it starts as a horror movie, you'd not expect it to turn into a social drama on important contemporary topics. Certainly didn't meet expectations that it itself created by the beginning.",2022-10-28
"Do NOT waste your time. I don't know how this got high ratings. I was so excited for this. Jason Long was the only good thing about this. I kept hoping this got better. I'm a huge horror film buff and I just seriously don't get this. I read the reviews and kept thinking ""ok this is is going to make sense"". And it never did. I apparently need more characters to finish this review so I'm just going to keep telling you to not waste your time. It's pure trash. Go watch Sinister. Or Sinister 2. Or Smile. Or all of the Paranormal activity movies. Or so many other movies. Just don't watch this one. It made no sense.",2022-11-01

I went to go see this movie cause it was supposedly ""the best horror movie in years."" 1st of all the movie is so sslloooowweee!, 2nd.. it just didn't make sense... and finally 3rd.. it was not scary what so ever, it honestly just have been labeled ""drama, thriller."" I guess I just make my expectations so high when a new horror movie comes out, I dunno.. but it's definitely not worth going to the theaters to watch it.. just wait until it comes out on a streaming service or iTunes. The actors was amazing in it but the story line wasn't scary at all! Just don't waste your money going to see this movie.",2022-09-23
"Finally an enjoyable horror movie with an interesting story, great writing and character development, and enough ""edge of your seat"" moments to keep you biting your nails from start to finish! And without all the paranormal, mass murderer, slash 'em up while jumping out from nowhere type scenes that directors have come to rely on for their scare factors.I loved how the different plots throughout connected into one comprehensive story in the end making it truly interesting and terrifying in the same breath. All 3 main characters were fantastic; especially Georgina Campbell. All great horrors need a heroine you can get behind and she absolutely nailed it.I haven't seen a horror in a while that keep me that entertained and thinking about it afterwards. I'll be recommending this to everyone- horror fan or not!",2023-01-05
"I went in not knowing what to expect and was pleasantly scared! The whole time you think Tess is crazy going into a house with a stranger and the red herrings really make you fear Keith. That and he does kind of resemble pennywise from IT.The story then follows a very sick and depraved storyline with monsters living in underground tunnels. Remind me never to get an Airbnb. I just saw ""Welcome home"" as well.The plot of this movie is similar to the British film Creep that talks about mutated feral creatures lurking in the underground tunnels of the London Tube. The direction of going from climax to a different character and past scenes is fun and leaves you hanging to the point where 30 mins into the movie I said, ""what is the movie over!"".I think the monster or barbarian was super creepy but something we have seen in so many movies like IT, smile and maybe even creep but I like the slight empathy that was created for the freakish monster at the end. It truly was a product of its own design and helpless like a feral animal.This movie is a thumbs up. But I still would have liked to know where the underground tunnels came from and also why would anyone buy a house in that God forsaken area. Did they not consult a Realtor? (Yes I'm a realtor).Happy scares.",2022-11-08
"A woman staying at an Airbnb discovers that the house she has rented is not what it seems.Barbarian was quite a surprise for me. After watching the trailers I was expecting another cheap jump scare horror, but it wasn't that. It was a well-crafted horror, that used its atmosphere, unsettling imagery, and fantastic performances to create horror and tension throughout the film, rather than jump scares. The performances from Georgina Campbell, Bill Skarsgard, and Justin Long were all fantastic. Campbell makes a great scream queen and was easily the stand out of this film. With that stated, the film does crumble apart, when the final act hits. It's filled with numerous bad horror tropes and becomes incredibly repetitive. Furthermore, there is also quite a big plot hole in this movie, but I won't really discuss it here because this is a non-spoiler review. Overall, a good horror movie, but does fall apart in its final act.I am giving Barbarian, a B.",2022-09-18
"I liked the acting, the visuals and the music. Almost everything was so good except for two important things. First, the purpose of the characters was not evident. In other words, the movie has introduced us to the three main characters hinting that they have their own stories linked to the house, but it did not!!Second, there were plots and events that did not make any sense. For example, how could two police officers see a woman in this condition and keep ignoring her? How could the police station ignore her reporting on the phone? How could the town residents know about this dilemma and did nothing about it for all these years? Too many events that miss each other!Quite frankly, I did not get the vibe of the movie!",2023-07-17
"I haven't been on the edge of my seat like this for a film in years. Don't let the trailer fool you, you know only a part of the story. So many twists and turns, the acting was incredible and I found myself actually frightened. Wonderful, I would recommend this film to anyone who loves thrillers or horror films. This movie really set a new standard for me as far as horror films set inside of a home. It went above and beyond as well with the world building. I feel like Tess really embodied everything that I would've seen in a female in a horror film, but all of the actors really did a wonderful, fantastic job.",2022-09-10
"Barbarian is one of those movies that tries to step out of the conventional style of presenting and pacing a horror movie with some interesting twists and disturbing imagery. And this is one of the movies that, even if I didn't fully like, I hugely appreciate the willingness and boldness to put something interestingly different that has more of a shock value aspect to it.The first thing I really liked about this flick is its first act and introduction. A young woman, Tess has booked an Airbnb somewhere in an abandoned town because she has a job interview the following day, and when she arrives in the evening she finds out that there has been a double booking issue. Because there's somebody else there, Keith, who has already booked the place for the same night.Now you might think that you can see how this scenario would go, but nope! Things take a drastic twist later on, and this basically is what this movie offers for the majority of its runtime. Very few events and sequences are familiar in this film and you'd often find yourself wondering what the hell is going on! And Every scene from then on takes you to a completely different turn of events.The first noticeable point here is how the movie incorporates modern lifestyle and certain things that we hear about and even use today, like Airbnb, and brings it into the horror genre which adds more of a tension to the atmosphere since a lot of us are familiar with it.What I also liked about this movie is its ability to sell you on what it wants you to see, to the point that it leads you to speculate, or maybe even believe what is going to happen next. It reminded of James Wan's style in his debut movie Saw, and the way he sequences the events. But the difference here is that Barbarian is more random. Rather than the idea essentially being about a single killer who needs to be caught and narrowing the speculations and focus of the viewer into just finding out WHO that killer is, the plot in Barbarian instead keeps shifting to more WTF scenarios, shattering all of your preconceived expectations about it and leaving you probably confused for a good while.So as the movie progresses, it moves into a new story and set up, and I was even thinking at the time after what happened to Tess and Keith on their first night, ""ok, these two are dead now, moving on to the actual story where the real buildup happens"", Until I realized later that that is not how it goes on.We're then introduced to AJ, a selfish, self-centered, celebrity who finds himself in the middle of a rape scandal and his associates have dropped him from their project and everyone has distanced themselves from working with him.We also get to see Portman, if you remember him from 2005 Doom, who appears to be your usual seemingly up-to-no-good, creepy dude who might have some dark secrets, which turns out to be true as he is revealed to have a woman kidnapped and held in his house, and that house is later on revealed to be the same Airbnb that Tess and Keith disappeared in and it's also owned by AJ.These three stories with their characters are then brought together to tie in with the entire plot to make for a more sensible and shocking scenario leading to the full climax in the end, while keeping the unpredictability aspect on.Now the pacing of the movie altogether was quite suspensful and well executed, and despite all the events revolving around few characters, it didn't drag on or seem slow at any point. The slow shots and build-ups were captivating for some moments, and actors were all very convincing too.These are the main points that I liked about the movie in general. But despite that, the movie wasn't perfect, nor was it even trying to be. There were some plot holes of course, for me anyway, where I didn't fully understand or was able to fit certain things together, for example, the relationship between the disfigured woman and Creepy Portman, my best guess would be that she is one of his victims who was held captive there for a very long time.Also why did Creepy Portman shoot himself after AJ found him? Was it because he was seen by an outsider and was afraid he would get caught? Or was he trying to end himself for a while but wasn't able to because the gun was far away from him?Also the story wasn't all that new and original in every part. It kind of reminded me of 2003 Wrong Turn, in the way that it was about a house in the middle of an abandoned area where our characters go inside and are ambushed by monster-looking creatures.Some scary moments also seemed familiar in their build-up, but what was more captivating as I mentioned earlier was the movie's unpredictability and focus on the shocking twists in its plot.So for my final score, I would give it 6.5/10. For its high level of gruesomeness and twists as well as its willingness to be different in its own way.",2023-01-15
"That was truthfully the dumbest movie I've seen in years. Wad this supposed to be a parody of a really horror flick? This is lipstick horror at its best. Predictable, full of eye rolls, and absolutely lacking in plot. When the ""mom"" puts the baby bottle down the pit, come on, you didn't laugh? Ridiculous. The obvious ""I've been living here for 15 years"" and then she has super human strength ripping the arm off and beating him tondeath with it? I have no idea what movie all those who rated this highly, but clearly we've lost our way when it comes to real, intense, frightening horror. Don't waste your tike or money unless you want something like ""attack of the killer tomatoes"".",2022-09-18
"I'm not sure what people are confused by. This movie was very straight forward and there really isn't that much up for imagination.It's a great monster/creeper flick. Definitely didn't know what to expect with such mixed reviews, but it's really that simple.First act was a little slow and also had some sprinkled in red herrings which really helped the second and third act to become that much more shocking.The interactions with police were so spot on, the interactions with men, so spot on. Just an all around good creepy movie with even a bit of dark humor sprinkled in.It feels as though some movie goers find a desperate need to understand side plot points that are entirely uneccesary for the actual film.",2022-10-30
"This movie should have been a mini-series, it started well and ended without explaining anything. I'm really interested in how the actors experienced this script when they read it, they must have seen it better than the audience.The start of the movie was great, but the rest of the movie seemed to be made just to fill space. I have nothing against the acting, they did what they could with such a bad script, and the bias due to famous actors also affected the rating. The plot has nothing to do with the film, there are characters whose existence is unexplained.This high rating is definitely just hype, it might be worth watching in the cinema to share the feeling of despair with other viewers.",2022-10-27
"I am a horror movie fan and i am used to characters making stupid decisions. However, when she stays to watch over the guy she doesn't know and then investigates the basement more instead of leaving immediately is far too stupid to be believable. Nobody would wait around and then go search down in the torture room. I haven't finished the movie yet, but my interest was immediately lost when that happened. Apparently i need to write more stuff for this review to count. Ok, the internet is dumb. Don't watch this movie. Now the movie jumped to some different story or something. I'm about to turn this movie off.",2023-07-08
"Barbarian is a wild ride that gives the impression of what its going to be starting out but literally leads you down a deeper rabbit hole. The acting is great and the cinematography slowly leads you to question the otherwise normal appearance of the house around which these characters' existence revolves. Once you move from one character's scene to another, you won't want to turn it off.As I mentioned before, some viewers might find the beginning a little slow but don't let this fool you. The main protagonist is easy to take interest in after the first few scenes while Justin Long is great as a well known actor whose reputation is suddenly in danger. Long's character is the owner of the house and he arrives later further adding depth to the neighborhood's backstory.The gore factor is quite high and there is much violence. Other elements in this film may be hard for squeamish viewers but if you think you can handle it, I'd recommend this one.",2022-11-02
"I might change my 6 star rating when I watch again in my own home but for now I'm sticking with 6.This film seemed so good to start off with but when we first see the mother it seems to be very fast paced and rushed.A lot of important things that should have been explained in detail such as the man who kidnaps and SA women and their children. This seemed confusing to me and rushed.Even still, Georgina Campbell done an incredible job and always the amazing Justin long but I don't understand why bill was cast. His screen time was approximately 20 minutes. I think he was only cast due to his previous work.",2022-09-15

I wonder if there are already reimbursement website's and class action lawsuits for the same. This movie tried to do something, but not even the creators know, as they must have been on the most epic acid trip of their lives when they edited the script. I can only imagine the movies Inception and VHS were playing on loop in the background at the same time, as it is the only thing that makes sense as to why there were at least four distinct incomplete, nonsensical, movies in one hour and thirty seven minutes.Worst gore end kill ever. I now hate Justin Long.",2023-07-15
"It's really atmospheric and unusual in some ways. I agree with another reviewer who wrote something like ""I've been glued to the edge of my seat"" in the first half of the movie.On a technical level, some cuts really surprised me - in a good way.Some elements were new to me; I haven't seen them before, and that's always interesting. I also enjoyed the music.I also agree with the many reviews about the downturn in the second half of the movie. It's good but it's nothing new or unexpected. It's average and didn't leave me with a feeling of wanting the movie to go on.The rather high rating of 8 is due to the first half of the movie that couldn't have been much better to me, followed by a rather average second half that doesn't manage to maintain the high quality. But it isn't bad either. It's not like anything is so bad that it destroys the experience of this movie for me.",2022-12-28
"I don't understand what exactly made this movie different from the others in terms on its suspense but i was on the edge of me seat 90% of the movie, only apart from the parts where they allowed you to take a breather. Lots of twists and turns in the movie, just when you think you've figured it out and it'll be just like all the other movies (predictable), then it does something completely different. Now i am not saying this was a horror/thriller masterclass display of creativity but I very much enjoyed the intensity of the scenes, it really felt like you were there with them.This horror film really done something that these types of filmed have been failing at over the last few years. The acting was very good, nothing award winning but overall very good acting, with a special mention for Skarsgard. I truly understand why people might think this movie is silly or stupid and that is kind of what mind me dropped some points from it. Normally i am a big advocate for realism in a film but personally i did not find it ridiculousIn conclusion, the movie has great acting, suprisingly interesting cinematography, a very impressive sound design team, and a very very suspenseful execution. For the poor quality of horror films we have seen over the years i think this one is great.",2023-01-29
"This movie is disturbing on so many levels. Even some parts that aren't supposed to be disturbing, kind of made me uneasy. It is also surprisingly funny in places. Justin Long really stole the show, and I didn't expect him to be that good. I watched this movie thinking i knew exactly what was going to happen...but I was wrong! With most of the horror flicks I watch, I can tell you within 5 minutes who is the bad guy and who is the good guy. Also, I can usually tell you within 5 minutes who is gonna live and who is gonna die. Not this time. Check it out. You will be surprised...and disturbed!!!",2022-09-17
"Yes, any cinephile who's into film, will gladly tell you what the greatest edit in cinema history is.In 2001, A SPACE ODYSSEY, when the ape-man throws a bone up in the air, and the camera follows it, and the screen cuts to the space station, in deep outer space, the audience is jolted and has to travel a million years forward.Don't read further if you haven't seen the film.The viewer is watching the film, BARBARIAN, and we're below the sub-basement, in a narrow underground tunnel, where it is almost pitch-black dark, and the.claustrophobia is almost too much to handle.And we go to absolute black for what seems almost wrong.And, suddenly, it's a panoramic view of the Pacific Ocean. And then we see a red convertible sports car, speeding down the Pacific Coast Highway. And the space, and the beauty, and the freedom, are all on display. And the feeling after what we just witnessed, is truly unbelievable.I really enjoyed BARBARIAN, and it deserves more praise then it's getting.",2022-10-31
"This is another one of those films that came out of nowhere. I heard good things about it but I must admit that I was slow to get around to watching it as I didn't think it could live up to it's height. But boy was I wrong, and I'm actually glad I was. There are some typical horror tropes but that's what makes it awesome. And they didn't go overboard with the 80's homages that every horror film that's been made in the last ten or so years has done. I love the 80's and of course I love 80's horror. But there is more to life than the 80's and this film does a great job and blending old and new. I have nothing bad to say about this one. Excellent job!",2022-12-28
"Look. Horror movies have been done to death. I don't know why people watch them, I find them extremely dull. I was not exposed to any hype for this or anything. I was first made aware of this movie because a RedLetterMedia ""Half in the Bag"" YouTube vid appeared today, and I thought, ""well, I should actually watch this movie before seeing the spoilers, because it sounds like it might be good."" I was 50/50 because lately those guys have been loving what i think is garbage.What I'll say is when you think you know what's up, it changes dramatically. This is a repeating pattern. It keeps changing it up, and that's what I found so much fun. It kept adding new elements, and mostly that's what I loved. It never stopped changing, adding new and unique elements to a horror movie. It was super fun. If I'd seen this in a theater, I might have annoyed other viewers, I was so enthused by it. Like, laughing with joy at extremely tense but fascinating moments. Like, clapping. I might even have exclaimed at points. I never do this. I really never do, but this could absolutely pushed me to that point.Georgina Campbell and Bill Skarsgard were great, as was Justin Long. To some extent this movie reminded me of ""Mandy"", another impressive and inventive movie.",2022-11-16
"I felt I had to write a review when I read some of the negative ones. As suggested I didn't watch the trailer and went in blind. I'm so glad I did. This is fundamentally a film about people and a reflection of society today. It shows the issues women face and cleverly keeps you wondering about if you can really judge a book by its cover. I won't say anymore as I don't want to spoil anything but all I can say is sit in the dark, watch this and enjoy!Side note: this isn't a film that will win Oscar's however it is one that will leave you thinking at the end. It took me a few minutes to digest it all!",2022-12-20
"When the movie first started I thought I had the plot all figured out. I thought it would be predictable through and through. However I was wrong! I do think it could've been longer (I'm a sucker for limited series- in fact I could see this plot being able to expand to a limited series). It has a good use of limited jump scares. I think some movies overkill it with jump scares to make up for a lack of ""horror"" in the actual story. Justin Long is good as himself as usual and Georgina Campbell is someone I didn't know about but look forward to seeing in future projects. Anyways, you're probably reading this cuz you're looking for a good scary movie to watch and I say just go for it!",2022-10-29
"For a horror film that was very enjoyable.The one thing and the first thing I care about in films in general is a good build of characters with justified actions.For every action they make, for every opinion they give there should be a reason behind it.And again for a horror film, this film did it very well, because usually characters behave in a crazy way just to amuse and entertain the audience without a need for explanation. Just for the element of surprise and the adrenaline rush.Barbarian was fun with good plot twists, some little gaps, but beautiful acting from Georgina Campbell.",2023-01-28
"I'd recommend this movie as a blind watch, it's still a decent thriller with some good twists and a twinge of humor/camp. If you decide to watch it, go into it knowing as little as possible. It's well-shot and acted and feels very unique in its tone.SPOILERS (I'll try and stay vague, but I'll go over the main beats of the film):The first 'act' of the movie is easily the best, the awkwardness and also the intelligence of the main characters was refreshing and got me really excited to see how the protagonist will continue to use her wit as we struggle to find who or what the threat really is.Then of course the real threat is revealed and the film jumps to a gritty and gory genre-space -something that instantly reminded me of 'the decent'- before abruptly introducing a entirely new character and plot line.At this point I'm still sold, this second act is still decent and kept my interest, it also explores more of the films themes. But unfortunately by the time the film introduces some backstory the storyline became less original.The final act looses momentum and starts to become silly. Part of me wishes that there was no flashback, and that whatever backstory could of been revealed in the present.All in all a fine, well-produced thriller, the messages of the film (how should a women protect herself against the threats men pose? Should a women be cautious of all men?) felt underdeveloped and I'm not quite sure how the theme of childbearing relates (I guess you could see the villain as being an amalgamation of the societal pressure and or exploitation of mother/women hood) but to me it lacked some depth. I think it should have stuck to the protection versus paranoia theme.",2023-09-03
"Freaking me out
This is not a cheap horror movie
There is a good directing, interesting story and events, and a scary mysteryThe camera conveys something wonderful in the moments when the director reveals the mysteryThe acting is fine from all the crewThere are also negatives, but when you see a horror movie that is not cheap these days, of course you should overlook these light negativesThe scary thing here is without burning
It is a kind of idea that is not new, but here its design is really elegant and terrifyingThe negatives lie in the superficiality of our knowledge of the characters in the movie
Or in the superficiality of our knowledge of the frightening story that takes place in this house.",2023-01-15
"Talk about a film that suddenly takes a sharp left turn! You definitely want to go into this film with as few spoilers as possible because the best thing about the film are the surprises. Fun film with good acting. A nice, tidy little genre flick that gives a little of the unexpected, which is just what I like in my horror films. Nice to see Justin Long play against type as a smarmy Hollywood exec.A man and woman book an airbnb at the same time through two different companies and decide to share the space for a night. Events ensue. Terror reigns and no one should ever rent an airbnb in Detroit!I recommend the film for anyone looking for a film they can't take completely serious, but still has some plot points that are plausible enough to freak you out.",2022-12-30
"This movie is like Nirvana, just gibberish word salad to create the perfect sound or whatever, clearly there's a lot of holes in some of the reasonings here. But I was genuinely scared most of the time. The guy who owns the thing... has to be extremely unwise, he is extremely narrow minded, you'd think its a total lack of intelligence but this is more or less narrow-mindedness, he just sees whatever right in front of him.So this movie is a depiction of the left and the rich elite , just extremely unwise and extremely narrow minded, close minded, totally inept clowns that has little brain activity.",2022-11-13
"A really well done and suspenseful thriller. Done with atmosphere and tension and very little gore. Well acted and a surprising amount of humor. A clever story, which left me surprised at every turn. The main lead is terrific and does a lot to carry the film. I went in knowing nothing about the movie and if you can do the same it will probably enhance your enjoyment. I wouldn't say the movie relies on twists, but it would be better to let it play out organically without knowing any of the details that come later. That said, I think the movie stands on its own, even if you have some idea of what might happen later.",2022-09-21
"This movie had a great setup, and a good cast. However, it tried so hard to be different and interesting and completely fell flat. A young woman goes to an air BNB only to discover it is double booked and a mysterious man is there.... interesting.However, the movie tries to go in a different direction, making you realize who you think it going to be the antagonist is actually a good guy.However, the events that follow are a mess.I think this movie could have gone and done something different and interesting and unique, but it followed the same as usual horror tropes, except that they weren't entertaining, gory, graphic, or unique in any way.The villain is barely shown at all, and only gets one very lame scene of backstory.This movie had protentional, but lacked the initiative to go there.The acting was OK, but the plot was so ridiculous and forced you to suspend your disbelief way too often.If it wanted to be a campy horror film, it failed. If it wanted to be unique and original, it failed.It was a slow burn, which I like, except there was zero pay off. I would have liked the backstory to be flushed out, or, in contrast, for it to just be a campy horror movie.So many plot lines were left unanswered. What about the tapes? What about the other women? Who was the woman? Where were the children? Why was she obsessed with the idea of a child? Did she lose a child?It was a waste of time. As it wasn't a fun gore fest, and it had no depth.I was so disappointed, and I wasn't routing for any character.Why did the ""big bad guy"" just commit suicide?Also, the timeline of 40 years didn't match up.

"First off, I'm glad I didn't pay money to watch this because it was pretty bad. I was pleased at the start, as there was an interesting premise interspersed with some tense and eerie scenes. However, the slow burn ended abruptly with the appearance of a hilarious-looking monster, upon which the film segues into a #MeToo cautionary tale.I'm a fan of Justin Long, but honestly I feel kind of bad for him for having to be associated with this film. His character goes back to where the previous low-IQ characters were killed and captured, upon which he makes such terrible decisions that it turns into a comedy of sorts. Then we are faced with a fairly bland backstory of what the Barbarian had done (I'm assuming the film is named after the man that imprisoned and forcibly impregnated all the women), and some other predictable events that lead us to the final scenes, where it turns into a critique on white privilege and the patriarchy (I'm not kidding), and - upon the death of the mother - a metaphor for motherhood.Maybe that's why people rated it so high - they were biased because of ""the message"". That notwithstanding, I imagine the trials of motherhood is the overarching theme of the film, but there are so many lazy and cheap allegories thrown in that it all just comes across as a big mess. Anyway, I give them a star for the first half's tense atmosphere and subtle horror, and another for the set design. In conclusion, this is an example of when writers try to subvert expectations for the sake of it, and forget that logic must also coincide.",2022-10-29
"It started out in a decent atmosphere using real in time situations and scenerary to depict what our main character Tess is stuck in. From that point on we are met with Keith who had the background and likeability that should be wanted by a main character but he is killed off in the most annoying, cheap way so early within the film.The storyline is shaky and there are not many answers. In a good horror movie the things that are unanswered are purposeful to the plot but here they are just confusing and show laziness in the storyline.AJ should have been introduced in the beginning with the rest of the characters. The random scene cuts to other storylines make the entire thing so unwatchable to an audience of people who like horror movies. Same with the man in the bed, that was a cheap background approach that made the movie more unlikeable.The scares are cheap. The backstories are unfufilled. The main antagonist has no backstory that we can follow and the protagonist is not a wanted final girl.At the end of the day, this is not a scary movie that would even meet the top two hundred. With the amazing Bill Skarsgård and Justin Long I expected a lot more from a horror movie. Do not watch unless you want to waste your time or analyze like I did. Two stars only for the fact that the acting was enjoyable in the beginning as well as the chemistry between Tess and Keith.",2023-03-03
"Horror in its prime is always a delight to watch. I'm saddened by the fact that I didn't watch this film on the big screen, since the thrill and tension would've been even more enhanced than it already was watching from a laptop.The plot was absolutely haunting due to the - sometimes very unexpected - disturbing sequences. Performances and a petrifying story kept me immersed from the beginning 'till the end. This film didn't feel like a cliché ""jumpscare"" horror film but instead one that keeps you on the edge of the seat with merely the thought of such scares possibly happening, or worse.I'm glad I didn't watch any trailers for this film nor watched any reviews and plot summaries, since the film is full of juicy surprises to keep you interested throughout this crazy ride. My mind put my expectations on a different path which made the actual plot of the story feel like a welcome surprise.What also added to my immersion and high-stress level as I watched this one is the clever cinematography. I adored the point of view shots with the seemingly natural lightning from cellphones & flashlights. The ominious set design and exploration of it while remaining - scarily enough - realistic makes the experience all the better.I definetely recommend this one for fans of disturbing horror that don't mind a few surprises along the way.",2023-01-01
"Overall I did like this film, it had suspense, was scary and was interesting. However, I'm mainly writing this review because a lot of things frustrated me. I'm going to mention a good few issues I had in terms of character decisions such as:-Why did Keith explore further and further into the maze when she only mentioned one room?-When the Cops were leaving, Why did Tess not beg them to give her a ride into town?-Why did Tess go back into the house when she already escaped, just run away?-Why did Tess try driving the Car into the Monster risking your only means escape?-After the Monster killed the helpful Black Guy (no surprise there), Why did AJ and Tess try to escape a different way instead of leaving the through the cracked fence which is how they got in there in the first place.-So predictably frustrating that AJ dropped the gun like an idiot when on top of the water tower!-After throwing the girl off the Tower, Why did AJ not run away just in case the Monster was still alive (which it was)?-Why did Tess not shoot the Monster straight away, although it didn't back fire, it definitely could have?Some will tell me that I am being too dramatic that these decisions bothered me but I can't help it. This is why a lot of Horror's annoy me because characters make stupid choices for the sake of the plot.But ignoring this gripe, it was a solid movie.",2022-11-18
"This film had a lot going for it. The soundtrack/use of sound effects. The cinematography was good and the acting was generally good too.Yes, the film had some jumpscares, but it was more the slowburn tension that is what made it scary.Although some moments in the story are cliche, i could not have predicted that plot at all and i thought some parts were disturbing.Easily in my top 5 horror films of the past five years.The only issue i have with the film is the way some of the characters behave, in particular the cops.Aside from that minor issue, i really liked the film and would recommend for all horror fans.",2023-01-01
"I do think it's a good, solid movie, at the end of the day.It has potential to be even better.But it wasn't what i was thinking or hoping, or wanting.I thought this would be the second most scary movie, I've, seen. Boy was i wrong, cause i don't think i was scared one.I also thought majority of the movie was gonna be Underground & claustrophobic, with a terrifying Creature.....eh.....not so much. I feel like not even half of the movie is thatThe Creature. Went from kinda creepy to lame as they explained her as the movie went onI thought the end was lame tooAlso too many weird moments, and they did a little too much, rather than keeping it simplistic and scary.Acting is good.I like the misleading, making us think one of the character is a Psycho.It is nice to see somethings Different.Its a solid movies overall, but i did feel underwhelmed. I can see myself liking it even slightly less as time goes on.7.9.",2022-11-06
"For obvious reason I'm not going into detail but this is one of the best horror/thriller movies I've ever seen. The cinematography really stood out to me and puts the movie in a category that really can't compare to much I've seen. Try to see this with an audience as I saw it at a Regal $6.50 Tuesday movie day. Also props to the company that cut the trailer for this, they did an amazing job showing so much without showing anything at all in this wild ride of a movie. If I can describe this movie in ANY WAY without ruining the plot, I'd say imagine Get Out had a CHILD with Malignant. Throw in an AMAZING cast and you get Barbarian. Hope this director continues to make horror like this and he COULD be the next ""Jordan Peele"" type of director. Thanks for reading y'all!",2022-09-21
"This movie was surprisingly good, i was hooked from the start to finish and enjoyed every bit of it, i got to say a great acting and atmosphere and direction, i especially liked the character 'AJ' portrayed by Justin Long his acting skills was good.If you want to watch this movie or recommend it to someone just go watch it without reading or watching anything related to it, you will enjoy it much more just like i did.I've seen reviews here trashing the movie but in my opinion most of them are taking this movie too serious, its a horror movie its natural to have things over the top and maybe exaggerating a little bit.Anyway its fun movie go watch it
9/10.",2022-11-24
"In the realm of modern horror cinema, ""Barbarian"" stands out as a breathtakingly audacious film, skillfully directed by Zach Cregger. This 2022 thriller not only reinvents genre norms but also serves as a testament to the innovative potential of horror storytelling. The film's brilliance lies in its ability to constantly subvert audience expectations, making it a standout with a solid 9/10 rating.At its core, ""Barbarian"" is a meticulously crafted narrative that delves deep into the psychology of fear. The film's opening sequence immediately sets a tone of unease, utilizing dim lighting and an eerie score to great effect. Georgina Campbell's portrayal of Tess, a young woman who discovers the rental house she booked is already occupied, is both relatable and compelling. Bill Skarsgård, as the mysterious tenant Keith, delivers a nuanced performance that keeps viewers constantly questioning his intentions.The brilliance of ""Barbarian"" lies in its narrative structure. Cregger ingeniously layers the storyline, gradually peeling back the layers of mystery. The plot twists are not just shock tactics but are deeply embedded in the story's fabric, each revelation adding a new dimension to the unfolding horror. The film's pacing is exemplary, with a crescendo of tension that grips the audience throughout.""Barbarian"" goes beyond traditional horror tropes, touching on real-world issues such as trust in strangers and the underlying dangers in urban settings. The film's subtle commentary on these themes adds depth, making it not only a thrilling watch but also a thought-provoking experience. The juxtaposition of the everyday and the macabre serves as a reminder of the often-unseen horrors that lurk beneath the surface of normalcy.The cinematography in ""Barbarian"" is a character in its own right. The use of lighting and camera angles amplifies the suspense, often leaving much to the imagination, which in turn heightens the sense of dread. The sound design is equally commendable, with its nuanced approach contributing to the film's immersive experience.While ""Barbarian"" is a tour de force in horror, certain aspects could have been fine-tuned. The character development, particularly in the second act, feels slightly rushed, leading to a few moments where the emotional connections could have been deeper. Additionally, the film's finale, although impactful, might have benefitted from a more subtle and ambiguous approach, aligning with the film's overall tone of understated terror.In conclusion, ""Barbarian"" is a remarkable film that revitalizes the horror genre. Its innovative storytelling, coupled with stellar performances and technical expertise, makes it a memorable and chilling experience. The film not only entertains but also provokes thought, lingering in the mind long after the credits roll. It stands as a shining example of how horror can be both intellectually stimulating and deeply unsettling, making ""Barbarian"" a must-watch for aficionados of the genre.",2023-10-29
"Do not spoil yourself. Don't try and see what others think about it. Watch the trailer and that's it. Because the trailer does not give anything away.The acting is great. Always like Justin Long in horror. The setting and filming is very good.Definatley not a masterpiece. But it's new and very unexpected. Worth a watch for pretty much everyone. Horror fans will love it. People that get scared easy will enjoy it even more and will be able to watch it.There is 2 things in the movie I was not a fan of but it is not the story. Just parts of it that was unnecessary. But they don't last long at all.All in all, a very fun watch.",2022-12-29
"Decent movie for Netflix, wouldn't have paid no money at the box office.The horror itself was good, but had too many normal life holes in it. The neighborhood and the way the police acted, too many red flags to say I am gonna stay there. Just to me, too many outside mistakes that could have been a better cover and make this a much better movie.Other than that, what goes on inside is very good, and thanksfully there were someone to explain part of it to understand what happen. But what killed me is the way the police acted when the woman called them and saw them face to face. That whole dept gonna be completely embarrassed when she makes it back.",2022-10-29
"This is the worst movie I've ever seen. All hype and then it turns to crap 50 minutes in. Overhyped, unexplained, and drawn out. Nothing is completed, and they hardly continue the plot. I don't understand the hype. Why do people like this? Barbarian introduces two strangers as guests in a B&B who become victim to a host who's uninvolved in the property. The host comes to check his property, and gets caught in the traps already set for the previous guests. Don't watch this movie, unless you want to be let down. Again, this movie has hype for all the wrong reasons, nothing is scary, this movie is so cringe and boring, nothing gets explained and the storyline continues to introduce new narratives, but never finishes to explain anything.",2023-07-28
"I don't think anyone would be able to predict exactly what was going on in this movie. I mean it literally took Keith getting his head bashed in for me to be fully convinced that he wasn't up to something evil or working with someone else down in the tunnels in order to lure people down there and cause harm. Also AJ's character was such an interesting take on how naïve us humans can be at times. As funny as it is to watch him and think ""How dumb can a person be?"", I actually found it somewhat realistic as I literally had a friend in high school who I could easily see doing the same thing. I also enjoy how the trailer doesn't give to much away and if you watch youtubers do review's on this movie you'd probably hear them saying the same thing as its a pretty big reason I feel this movie is successful.",2022-09-17
"Cannot fathom how this got over 5 stars. No explanation, no real story, something random in basement. Easily one of this worst movies of the year.The characters are fine, but how things play out makes no sense. And no explanation is given to something rather obvious. Not to mention the whole renting a room bit which again makes no sense which sucks because the movie builds on it. Trying not to give away spoilers here.I think this might be one of the most disconnected movies I've seen in a while. There's like 3 character stories that do not tie together well, or explain how things came to be. Particularly the 2nd main character who get a bit of utterly unrelated background that doe snot affect the story in any meaningful way.Again cannot stress how this got over 5 stars. If you're reading this make sure you got some time to kill and some time to get mad for how dumb everything is. How can you make such a bad movie these days? That's probably the worst part of the movie.",2022-10-28
"Tl;dr- Go in with an open mind ready to actually take a trip. That means getting thru getting to know people. The ride is a little slow, but that's the point. That's what sinks it into reality and makes it a every emotional movie. Excited, annoyed, cringing, crying, and finally laughing as the catharsis of the events concludes with the end of the credits. I loved the trip and I definitely will want to watch this again sometime soon.It really says a lot when you see a bunch of low ratings. It seems most are entitled and don't want to spend the time getting to know the characters. That's what makes a movie good you know. Part of good writing is creating characters that make you feel one way, or another. The good writers can make you feel the arc like a roller-coaster.I didn't know what to expect going into this. I find it better that way. I did not know it was a studio picture. I thought it was going to be a smaller art house type of thing. I honestly felt my hopes fall when I heard the Fox banner music. I was very surprised.It's best not knowing anything. It will seem random and as you can see by the low ratings and my mini-rant, people don't want to take the time to get invested, and are surprised when they don't feel anything other than their supposed ""boredom."" It is a touch slow because it's not a simple story, but hang with it. If your attention span or thought process is too heavily labored by the most menial tasks, then yes. Skip this. It's rewarding to see a great movie.I was; annoyed, shocked, creeped, cringed, surprised, and fully engaged. You have to give the movie a second to go because of the interesting characters you meet. You have to love them or hate, and it will have you judging people using your own life lense. It makes you think, about who we trust, why we trust. A nice comment about how really out of touch we've become. Jaded by the internet and the world events we've witnessed. It's hard not to be defensive and want to attack first. It's OK to like things tho. I think we've had more than enough edgy for the sake of edgy.Yes there are choices that are made that some have a hard time wrapping their head around. The selfish and the smart answer tend to go hand in hand on horror movies. But the movie is supposed to be an experience. Seeing someone's life, not all this edgy jaded stuff you see everywhere. Thinking about helping someone else seems counter intuitive, little c really showed us that with how people couldn't be bothered to wear a small mask and do their part to keep people alive. Anyone that defends their choice to not wear one shows the exact ""edgy,"" callous thinking that seems to permeate every orifice of entertainment. We should want to be better zand sometimes that means making stupid ass choices. I for one would not have helped the second time. That's the judgment call we all have to make, and you never know if you've never been in that situation.",2022-10-30
"A movie that started well but turned into a walking disaster - that's about the best definition you can find for this movie.Let's start with the fact that this film should not be categorized as a horror film, because it is simply not scary except for the first scene where the enemy of the film is first exposed. I have to praise the sharp transition that happens immediately after this scene, because you stay for quite some time with thoughts in your head whether the movie is interrupted and ends here or there is going to be a connection back to the plot here.There are so many flaws in the plot, why did it take so long for the movie to become a thriller? What is the value of this long time? What was so important about the short novel in the beginning if they got rid of it so quickly? How could it be that the mother had superpowers if she is completely human? Why did they focus on the mother's husband if he wasn't murdered in the end? What happened to him? Why was it important to the owner of the house than the main actress if he ended up sacrificing her? How did the mother survive the fall from the tower? I can continue to ask so many questions with an illogical answer but what matters in the end... is that I was not afraid not even for one moment of the movie. Bad.",2022-12-21
"Many people are describing the trailer as deceiving - when that's the furthest thing from the truth. It just doesn't show much, as any trailer should. Spoilers are never welcomed in marketing!!!But this film was bizarre, extremely (EXTREMELY) funny at times, and also very very frightening.Do I want to spoil it? Absolutely not. The film relies on surprise and shock, and spoiling would kind of ruin it.It might be one of my favorite films this year, up there with Peele's NOPE. Whereas Peele's NOPE was unique in the blockbuster horror world, BARBARIAN was unique (maybe even foundational - if everything goes right) in the indie horror world.A truly unique vision. What more is there to say? I have so much to praise and talk of, but I really don't want to spoil a thing about it. Watch it!! It'll be a hundred percent worth your time.And don't get spoiled. Trust me. This movie is not what you expect.",2022-09-18
"Director's delivery of movie's plot: raining night, cozy house, two young strangers, suspicious coincidence with booking - was just perfect. For the reason that you always anticipate that there is something wrong, and this intrigue (lying on the background of homely half-romantic atmosphere) is a terrific director's move.Creepy and thrilling moments work absolutely great on that ground. I mean here the night-time, terrifying neighborhood (revealed in the morning) and of course the basement.However, the first wrong step was too sudden death of Bill's Skarsgard character. It killed all the suspense and conspiracy around him (plus his character was indeed appealing). It was definitely a wrong decision, knowing that it happend at the middle of the movie.Appearing of Justin Long's character and his moving to the house, obviously, couldn't be compared to the intrigue which was around Campbell and Skarsgard's characters at the beginning.After Long discovers Campbell, and Mother's prehistory is presented, you may say goodbye to all the intrigue and say hello to a whole lot of questions.What had happened to the neighborhood?How is it possible that the only house with this disgusting creature is also the only house which stayed not abandoned?And how, for heaven's sake, is this same evil house became the one owned by the agency offering its rent?And it gets cleaned up regularly without noticing the Mother or any traces of her filth left in the house? (Homeless man made it clear that the creature leaves the basement, hence the marks of her presence should have been definitely there)How could all of the tunnels be made by only one man? And for what reason? (If the secret room in the basement was more than enough)I don't even want to mention the explaination of Mother's nature and origins (homeless person described her as a product of multiple incest acts and births, though if she was born in 80s, and her mother and grandmother ""aka her sisters"" should have been at least 13 to bear a child, and obviously the maniac wasn't doing his evil deeds since childhood; - there just mathematically can't be such a whole lot of incest generations as the movie tries to put it.Also it was extremely hard to believe that director made this booking coincidence indeed just a coincidence.To sum up, everything is merely perfect untill the death of Skarsgard character. Second part of the movie and especially the ending were simply unsatisfying comparing to the the first part.It was very disappointing to see how abruptly the movie had lost this great intriguing thread surrounded by this peculiar cozy-trilling ambience, and had gone into the typical case of modern horror film.Really disappointing...",2022-11-03
"I get that the people that are rating the movie low wanted to see another 'Saw' or 'The Ring' or something like that. This is more than that. The only thing that I had a hard time swallowing was the part where all 3 characters (especially Tess) went on to go in a dark corridor/stair/passage. But it's a movie, you accept it's done for the plot's sake.Still, I was on edge most of the time. There is a part in the middle where you get introduced to the 3rd main character, which is very strategically placed, to slow your tension a bit.But what made the movie different for me, was that you could see the different kinds of characters.Keith, down to earth, kind and maybe a bit socially akward, who has his head tuned right. He is the kind of person that is not easy to survive, that's why he gets killed (even though we don't have that much info).AJ, a bit arrogant, thinks he is someone (though obviously he's not so well known) and always puts his wants and needs on top. What happens in an emergency situation is that he has no survival skills and his true self shows. He has a realization at some point, aknowledging that he's done harm, declares that he wants to make this right and help Tess, but when he has the opportunity to help and make things right, he disregards everyone else and doesn't hesitate to sacrifice another person to survive. And that's why the movie kills him.Tess is persistant, cautious, adaptive and always wants to go back and help, despite the impossible situation. That's the person the movie wants to survive.From my point of view, this movie has more to offer than just some jump scares. Is it the best thriller/horror movie ever? No. Is it a good movie? Sure.",2023-09-10
"Great to see something somewhat original in the horror genre. The frequent change of tone and shock effect was incredible. Also, there was great dramatic irony in many scenes. Pacing was great and was only slightly slow in the beginning. Acting was incredible throughout. For those plan on seeing this, just beware that it is fairly dark and often times disturbing. Amazing jump scares and build up of suspension throughout the movie. This is one of the best horror movies made in the past few years and was an amazing theater experience. I hope the horror industry is taking notes because movies like this are where it's at.",2022-09-25
"LOL This movie was pretty funny. It's definetly not horror and has absolutely nothing to do with horror genre, not sure why they labeled like it, and I guess thats why it get's so many negative reviews. I and my wife went to see it today and some scenes were just plain hilarious and caused uncontrolled laughter, however overall it was pretty boring with pretty much no plot, no story and no character development. But, if you can put all that aside, and just enjoy a satyrical low grade comedy about motherhood, family values and all that other BS consumerist society is obcessed with these days then it actually makes sense. Anyway, if this is horror, then Orgazmo is drama haha.",2022-09-25
This movie starts out with a premise seen before but nicely paced with an ominous undertone skarsgard really immerses his head into this movie ...... then the fun roller coaster of the movie begins to up things to some crazy new levels .... This is a perfect film for this time of year and a perfect lights out Halloween horror flick... yes it has to be said the last 20 minutes or so are pretty insane but roll with it I have to say it takes a really good horror to impress me and this grabs your attention and then some.... with some truly terrifying and off the wall moments albeit with a slight touch of humour to the mix !!,2022-10-25
Interesting start that hooks you but eventually lets you down. The movie started of strong with great build up between the two characters and the mystery behind the basement but as the story progresses and we see more of the back story behind the house.It's like as soon as Justin Long came on screen the atmosphere of the story suddenly changed and I was infinitely rooting for his character's demise instead of worrying about what happened with Bill Skarsgard and Georgina Campbell.The last 30 minutes of the film was completely lost on me based on the series of weird decision making the characters made.,2022-11-05
"As the first act came to an end of this three, very distinct act movie, I thought I was watching a horror masterpiece. Then the rest of the movie happened.The first act is what I consider a clinic in building unease and tension. Everything on the surface being normal but gives you the feeling that everything is wrong all at the same time.The second act is a comedy character building segment.The third act is just self aware goofy schlock, not as bad as a Troma film but somewhat adjacent.As a result of this mess of tones, some might see it as ""CrAzy TWisSTs"" but for me the craziness ruined the good will the first act gained. Either way you look at it the drastic changes in tone give me ""A Cabin In The Woods"" feel where once you watch it, it is spoiled for good.The movie only really has 3 characters and they all end up extremely dumb. There is a lot of moments that just don't make any sense whatsoever. The movie is pretty minimal on gore but has good effects. It's shot and acted well.In the end this feels like the writer had 3 different ideas and shoehorned them together to make a movie length feature. I'd say it's worth watching for the horror fan, but I won't make the effort to watch this ever again.",2023-01-06
"I would say this movie has promise, but everyone was too dumb to even exist! The acting was good but the story could be better, also what's the point if protagonist not likable making every possible mistake. It has some suspenseful events like what she plans to do with them or if they even manage to make it out alive. The police is exactly how i expected them to react and no surprise at all. I like the twist at the end with the homeless guy. I had hopes it would be a demon or supernatural legend type of movie but I guess reality is a lot more terrifying in a sense that this happens everywhere.",2022-09-17
"The only thing I have to say about this movie is, what the actual heck is wrong with people. In this film, there were so many bad decisions that were made. It's the kind of movie that makes you smack your own face and say ""why would someone ever think to even do that!?"" This movie would have probably been 45 minutes if the people it the movie made smarter decisions. But that aside, I really enjoyed watching this film. It definitely did a good job at getting my attention and putting me on the edge of my seat. Definitely one of my favorite movies of all time and would definitely watching this film again.",2022-09-12
"I'm not going to say it was a bad movie because it was done well I love horror movies to an extent but dude I had my hands over my eyes 70% of the movie. The scary part is the realism of what can happen. It's was a great movie but it was too much for me but that doesn't mean you don't enjoy it I would definitely give it a shot if you love horror and suspense. Just to much for me, to say the least if you love horror movies and can handle a lot watch it, it was a well produced movie with good actors and gives you a little background on Detroit Im the prime of its area and where it is left now. 8/10.",2022-09-24
"A few reviews got me to sit down and watch this. As so wine who is a little tired of the horror/thriller, which is in it's 'stale' cycle that happens every few years, weeks of illness forced me to lie in bed and catch up with movies on my watch list.It starts as a typical psychological thriller - is that person good or bad? What's going to happen next? - and some of the character decision making is truly so ridiculous it nearly ruined my viewing experience, but put that out of your mind you'll be treated to a very tense and interesting nearly 2 hours, and a rewarding ending too.The movie shifts pacing a couple of times, which is a pleasant surprise, and there are enough jump scares and creepy scenes to keep the most hardened horror watcher stuck to the screen. The only sticking point for me is Justin Long. I like him. He's a decent actor. But his 'schtick' he's become famous for its slightly tiring at times. In this, his character is just a little twist on his Jeepers Creepers character, with a few differences obviously, but is basically the same. I know that's who he is, and he has more 'edge' in this, but another actor could have fitted just as well in this.Sit back, get some popcorn, and enjoy though. It's well made, well paced and could become a modern classic.",2022-11-05
"I can't believe I have to write this review but after reading a vast amount of these, I can't not because y'all are so ridiculously blind to give this film such bad reviews.First off, in response to those who keep stating Tess makes dumb decisions, from the trivia: '(Cregger wrote and adapted a short that) consisted entirely of a conversation in which a woman continues to ignore a series of mounting red flags.'
Let me just say this - She is a woman. She is a woman of colour. She is a woman of colour who just got out of an abusive relationship. She is a woman of colour who just got out of an abusive relationship in an unfamiliar area and situation. She is on guard. She doesn't have anywhere else to go. All of her actions are actually understandable when you consider the history of her character and the history of women in general, if you can look outside your privilege and recognise that panic makes us do dumb things in the moment that don't make sense.She doesn't drink anything he makes for her; she takes a photo of his licence (presumably for later evidence, or to send to a friend for safety purposes); she is wary of every single thing he says but stays polite and goes against her better judgement multiple times because that's what women have been taught to do.Opinions like those expressed in other reviews are literally the reason why incels exist; patriarchy put both men and women in these boxes, you don't like us in them and you sure hell don't like it when we break out of them.As to why the homeless man stays and doesn't trust cops - he's Black, homeless and I'm guessing doesn't have a lot of choices. Better the devil you know, y'know?The tunnels and the probably spring-loaded, self closing door - obviously Frank built them.The neighbourhood - y'all were okay with IT, where the entire town knew something was going on but did nothing? You understand 'don't ask, don't tell' in terms of military but don't understand people keeping themselves to themselves for fear of subjecting themselves to something worse by getting involved?Why she goes back for AJ - because she doesn't know what we know (that he's just about the worst person ever), because she's human and sees another human in danger, because society has cast women as nurturers, even if it cost them their safety and sanity.Missing women and man without wife or baby buying baby supplies - first of all, do you know how many people go missing and no one notices? Particularly those of Indigenous decent but just in general, it's a lot. When they were searching for Gabby Petito, they found like seven flipping bodies that no one was even looking for. Frank could've gone to other towns, man, that's just painfully obvious.A convention filling up the hotels - I had a mate who landed in the UK years ago only to find the entirety of the accommodation was booked out for a U2 concert and he spent the night wandering around with his back pack.Everyone seems to take issue with Tess' behaviour, but barely anyone has mentioned AJ's. That he just keeps measuring when he finds the bucket-bed-camera room, because he DOES NOT RECOGNISE THE DANGER INHERENT IN THAT SET UP, such as a woman would immediately. This also true of Keith, who has to SEE the room to apparently know it's bad news. The fact that AJ drops not one, but TWO potentially life saving weapons. You're fine with him shooting the wrong person in a moment of panic, but not fine with the decisions Tess makes in an anxiety-inducing and seemingly never-ending situation. I love how many people think that they'd behave in a perfectly rational manner in times of great stress, it's amazing.Anything else? Oh, why is it called Barbarian? Again, from the trivia: 'The term ""barbarian"" originated in Ancient Rome. Romans would call non-Latin speakers ""barbarians"" because their languages sounded like ""bar bar bar bar"" to their ears which is similar to the vocalizations of the mother when trying to say ""baby"". The other more obvious reference is Frank kidnapping and raping women and their offspring being objectively barbaric. Also, Frank is, quite simply, a resident of Barbary Street, ie. 'a Barbarian'.'
Enough, y'all. Check your privilege and appreciate this movie for what it is - an intelligent, thoughtful look at the complexities of men and women and what trauma does to a person.",2023-01-16
"Legitimately terrifying, enthralling and expertly delivered, Barbarian is one of the best horror movies in recent memory. Set in an Airbnb in a rundown part of Detroit, it's part Silence of the Lambs, Hill Have Eyes, and eerily reminiscent of the X-Files episode ""Home"". Unlike others in the genre that rely on cheap scares, Barbarian earns them and dares to take risks. No cheap jump scares but ones that are built organically and surprise the viewer. The plot is never fully explained, yet subtly unfolds for the audience-letting us know just enough to be horrified. Its always enjoyable to watch, smartly written, and never loses us for a moment. A must see.",2022-11-26
"Really a very good movie. In my opinion this is the best horror movie of 2022 and the best horror movie in years.Very scary and unpredictable,before you watch this movie you must be prepared for a lot of unexpected scenarios amd twists.Acting and casting is perfect.The only thing that would have made this movie better is if Keith had more screentime. He is one of the best characters in a movie in years,really enjoyed seeing Bill Skarsgard playing the roll of Keith. Big reason why the first half of the movie is so good.Really recommend watching this if you are a horror fan,because it will keep you on the edge of your seat.",2022-11-01
"The cinematography is solid, the acting and editing is well done, and the screenplay is also solid; but the overall story is left wanting, it started out as a short story, and unfortunately it never fully fleshed out.The movie is well done however, it will leave you saying what the #*$# as the picture creeps you out in truly horrific and surreal ways. It gives you all the slasher goodies and delivers them in a fresh package. I'm not a slasher fan, but I checked out the flick because it was rated so high, and I'm glad I gave it a shot, the ride was well worth it. Like I said, the story falls short somehow, but the ride is well worth the watch.",2022-10-30
"The movie does a very good job of turning life typical situations and overemphasizing the ""what-if"" maybes that horror entails. With a good use of music and intrigue, the movie starts off as a psychological horror where you are scaring yourself into situations. It only about halfway into the movie that the true horror is brought into play and the movie shifts entirely in a new direction.In a genre that could use some extra mystery versus jump scares and gore, the movie does a good job of blending modern lifestyles including airbnb's and rental properties, job interviews and the like and hides a deeper layer of supernatural that our normal lives may be built on top of without even noticing.",2022-10-30
"Had it's moments but could have been so much more. When the girl at the concession told us that she had to leave half way through for fear of heart failure we were beyond excited. The idea of a rental in the middle of a burned out Detroit suburb was such a great start and I really thought we were off to the races! The second half went in a more comedic direction which was kind of bewildering, however I did like the confused Justin Long character and would have loved to have seen a bit more background on him. All in all, if you want horror watch Hereditary or an old movie like Burnt Offerings, this one didn't have much for chills unfortunately .",2022-09-12
"There's a lot about this film I really like. It sets an eerie tone from the start and manages suspense throughout. The subtlety in which events unfold masterfully escalate in severity as the film goes on. It doesn't rely on jump scares and other cliche horror tropes. And the parts that are familiar; ""serial killer"", ""someone in the house"", etc are done with a realism that helps ground the film. The cast is well chosen and all submit dedicated performances. You see and believe the horror on the face of each character every time.However, there are several plot holes that stuck with me- for one example; how those living within the house came to do so for son long while renters, etc came and went. Additionally the story opens up a few avenues that I wish it would have fleshed out a bit more- more on the origins of how those below came to live that way for so long, etc. Plausibility is key with horror and some parts of the story have me struggling to suspend my disbelief. The solid acting and fx help, but it does seem like the film could have benefited from some patience in the editing room and a more linear story line.",2022-10-28
"Yes.. Film has the different aura that I can not totally ignore. The stress, especially laying through the dark tunnels is being given in the right and dark way, but it is not enough to save the content of the movie. Why?Because, Something about characters is lack.. Especially we do not know what the man's problem is.. Why he does to this to women.. Why he is obsessed with babies? What is the story of the woman, running inside the tunnels? Why Why Why?.. It begins good, but actually through the final, the movie began not to give any answers to my questions..Even though the house is limited, the voltage is supported in good way. Actually, the plot can be developed in different and unique way, even the reasons of evil characters would be written in the horrific way..I thought that the director destroys the safety of people by using Air bnb application idea. Tess is victim of Air bnb application providing her a house in the town that she does not know. Really, we must be careful about houses that we can rest for a while.. It could turn to everything that we are not able to predict.Chaos is being given good, but the backgrounds of characters are lack..",2022-11-09
"Yes, it has ""plot holes""....good job. You found a plot hole in a movie about underground house Detroit bunkers and single generation mutants.That's not an argument for what makes a bad movie when it has other goals and direction in mind.I really enjoyed the premise of the film. I also enjoyed the three split stages to the film. The center of the movie completely switched to a comedy, and I really enjoyed this as it was both unexpected and highly enjoyable, while still contributing to the development of the plot.The themes were fantastic, regarding the decay of good neighborhoods, judging a book by its cover, and social differences. Each character contributes to these themes well.The flashback scene was fantastic and is going to stick with me for a while. It had some of the best shots I've seen in a while. Took unique shots and eerie atmosphere to contribute to really hammering the movies main theme home. Despite being brief, I honestly think it's the highlight for me.",2023-01-02
"I can't even think of cops being more terrible at their job than how this movie has portrayed them and the funny thing is that it is true. Also Justin once a wuss, always a wuss...i mean not at first to be honest, at the start he seems very courageous even and very bright that I was actually surprised, but afterwards towards the end his mind is all gone and lost, and can't face or hurt anything not even a fly but he will hurt other good people to survive kind of guy, so no no, not so bright after all. They definitely did a better job with him in this film than in House of Darkness! But the rest had a great performance. We definitely need more horror movies with Bill but as the main guy or perhaps the main villain. Too bad we didn't see too much of him in this film. Georgina Campbell is probably my first film I've seen with her and I'm already blown by her performance, and also i'm so in love with her. Amazing actress or actor!!!",2022-10-28
First 30 min great....went downhill after that!Had a good laugh for the last 75 min. Honestly stay home and watch Netflix or Prime. Definetly not scary more of a comedy with a bit of gore. The scenes that provided a bit of thrill we're coupled with bizarre human behaviour. Gangly old lady wanting to breast feed a baby in my opinion just didn't fit with keeping it to my expectation of a great horror/thriller. Gives you a reason to really be careful when requesting a Airbnb reservation to make sure it's legit and not double booked. I really was hoping this would be a good scare as it had a good cast. Surprised it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Not a fan of comedy coupled with horror.,2022-09-10

"So I went in with low expectations (I got dissappointed so many times with horror movies lately)...what can I say? I enjoyed this movie A LOT. The effects were great, acting great, story was original. The only thing I missed was a little more backstory (what exactly was the motive etc), but that is just my prefference. I really appreciated all of the special effects and that almost no CGI was used. This just creates a different movie experience and all seems more realistic. Overall a well done horror movie! We need more movies like this one.I also enjoyed that it was all about the movie without any political agenda.",2022-11-12
"I loved this film! It was a jumpy, heart racing fun horror flick. Keeps you on the edge of your seat and has so many good scares.Go in blind, don't watch the trailer just jump right in. I am so glad I didn't know what the story was about before I watched it because I was constantly surprised and I really enjoyed it to the end.People expect so much from horror films. They are not meant to be the most believable stories so I wish people wouldn't rate them on the silly things that happen. It's meant to be light hearted fun watching a horror movie so just take it for what it is and don't read into it!",2023-01-22
"I can't relate with the negative views. All the seemingly nonsense details in the film could happen in real life. Like the cops being jerks and the gun falling, etc. People act clumsy and quite random in real life. This movie was FINALLY something original to watch and really extremely scary especially if you watch it after midnight on a big screen with high volume. Dont waste this on a computer screen with shitty sound or anything if you are a real horror fan. I can compare this to classics such as the exorcist, changeling, etc. The visual effects and the sound effects were spot on as well. Jump scares, as well as an eary atmosphere with an intriguing plot. What else does one want?",2022-10-29
"I fancied this after seeing the trailer and then hearing all the buzz.The trailer gives a bit away but not enough to spoil it. This film isn't quite what you think.One of the pleasing things is the running time. Only about an hour and a half which is great for this type of movie. I had high hopes after realising I'd watched half an hour and nothing at all had happened, yet I was totally engrossed.The dialogue was really good and the fact that the film keeps you guessing what is going on was great.When the horror starts, it really heats up. I always say if I watch a horror I want at least 3 frights. Well I only got one here, but it was a big one so I'll excuse it.Without giving anything away, the film does take a shift midway, which I wasn't sure if I liked. However on reflection, it worked and all tied in well.I'd definitely recommend this to not just horror fans, but all movie fans.",2022-11-15
"My advice is to go into this movie with as little knowledge as possible and also, don't let the good or bad reviews sway you.I had never watched the trailer but heard a lot of good things on social media about this movie. That was my first mistake - because I think my expectations were a little too high.I will say the first 30 to 45 minutes are excellent. You have this idea in your head of what's happening and what is going to happen and then the movie completely does a 180. Sure, I like twists and turns as much as the next person but I felt like this story was bizarre in a way that really didn't make sense. There were a lot of unanswered questions and the ending felt extremely rushed and a little messy.Acting is great, the movie looks great, but for me it does not live up to the hype.",2022-10-28
"Let's just start off with the obvious, there were a ton of holes that made no sense. But, who cares!? It was a good fun horror movie. I was rooting for the main character to survive. I jumped, a couple times! And I laughed throughout the movie. It was super creepy and eerie, and then it turns a bit grotesque. It was a ""Hills have eyes"" meets ""people under the stairs"". To truly enjoy this movie, just throw your logic out the window. I also liked the subtle messages in the movie, and especially the not so subtle messages. I caught myself yelling at the characters in my head while watching a be movie, ""what are you doing?!""",2022-09-20
"I just finished watching the movie and it was terrifying, unexpected and amazing. It's been a long time since I've seen a good horror movie.Here's my theory:
What if Keith was one of those kids that an old guy was producing.Keith was also the one supplying both monsters with food and water. Cause how would they get food, wanted, and all they necessary supplies for survival?He was also managing the rental side and would ""check out"" instead of the tenants.He was just too suspicious...Maybe monster mommy wanted to keep victims alive and Keith would just kill them? That's why she decided to kill Kieth and keep Tess as her little baby.",2023-04-02
"I've seen a lot of horror movies in my time.. some bad some goofy, some down right really scary! But this movie is a joke! It starts out with promise.. looks like it's going to be a decent movie. But then after finding never ending tunnels underneath the house you find or that the one that's locking people up and killing them is an old lady with boobs hanging down to her knees. I'm not kidding.. and the reason she's kidnapping people is because she's wanting to find/ recover her baby that died. There were so many laughable moments at the stupidity of this movie I almost walked out. If my wife who loves all horror movies regardless of the stupidity wasn't with me I would've left. This movie is really really bad.. don't waste your money! Wait for it on your streaming service or on demand trust me!",2022-10-01
"I really do not know what to think about this movie. On one hand, one must admit that the creators of the movie tried to be innovative and to avoid expectations, but in all that trying, i felt that the final result was not as good as they are thinking it was. The discovery of ""what lies beneath"" was just too bizarre and hilarious (not sure if the intention was to make it look hilarious) to take it seriously. Not to talk about ""inhuman"" powers of the main villain.That aside, the whole building-up was also very generic as the characters were making the same mistakes all the horror movie characters do.And yes, i simply cannot get over the fact that the main character rented a house like that that is literally in the middle of nowhere.",2022-10-31
"Before watching this film I had absolutely no idea what it was about other than I'd heard positive things about it through social media horror groups. I saw it pop up while me and my partner were doing the nightly TV scroll for an adequate horror and I said ""Ooh I wanna watch this it's supposed to be good.""
So it's quite slow paced for a start; you could almost think you're watching watching some rom-com. However you're naturally really supicious of Bill Skarsgard's character- is he an innocent guy who just got double booked like her or is he some crazy mastermind who's gonna drag her into the basement and torture her? The suspicion and the trying to figure out what on earth the plot is is the torch that keeps you going through this part, and the not knowing where to look for the horror as it's still set up like a horror film but you don't know what you're meant to be scared of yet.Jumping ahead, she discovers creepy basement, gets stuck, he helps her out, she's freaked out and wants to leave, he's like ""well let me see what's down there."" Ohhhhhh come on mate she's right, crime documentary neighbourhood, weird dirty room with a camera and a bed- get the hell out of there in one piece!! (Of course you guessed it they both go down there and it goes wrong.) But everything after that I just couldn't have guessed!The film is basically divided into 3 acts, each as slowly and carefully paced as eachother. Justin Long appears half way through and I started laughing and just thought ""What absolutely messed up situation is this guy gonna end up in?""
I won't commentate the entire plot as if I can do one thing, it's convince people that this film is better than the mediocre reviews here suggest. I'm astounded at the amount of dissapointed reviews which I can only attribute to people expecting the film to be a lot more serious or elevated than it is. It's probably the most fun me and my partner have had watching a horror for a long time. Does it have a couple of little plot holes and ""come on"" moments? Yes. But I always think that can be forgiven when it's one of those where you're both shouting at the actors to leave the house but want them to stay and see what happens too. If you liked The Menu or Tusk you'd probably enjoy this. Is it a deadly serious, iconic piece of it's time? No. But does it cover some social issues, give you a thrill and make you laugh? 100% yes.",2023-06-13
"It's always a toss-up whether forays into horror from traditionally comedy directors are going to be successful. Some that missed the mark include David Gordon Green with his Halloween re- imagining and Kevin Smith's bizarre Tusk, while Jordan Peele. A once comedy stalwart, made some of the most memorable horror outings of the decade. After the credits rolled on Barbarian, and having read up on its director Zach Cregger, I was shocked how many vapid and ill-received comedy turds littered his filmography. Make no mistake, there are shades of deliciously dark humor in his latest effort, but they're sandwiched in between some of the most unpredictable and wildly entertaining moments I've witnessed all year. The less you know about the plot the more rewarded your initial viewing will be - what starts as a simple case of double-booking soon morphs into something far more sinister. The movie's insistence on subverting the audience's expectations is its biggest asset - once you think you know where things are going the film will dramatically shift the scene, characters, tone, and further into the movie, even its chronology. The transitions are sometimes a bit jarring, the characters, in true slasher horror fashion, often make nonsensical decisions, and the movie's climax doesn't really stick the landing, but Barbarian is a movie that hopefully jump starts Zach Cregger auspicious horror turn in his dubious filmography.",2023-01-03
"The first half had me really interested, it was serious, dark and mysterious just how it was advertised but then the 2nd half just turned into a really stupid comedy and the mystery just turns out to be the most obvious thing when you think of a dark basement with cages, food bowls and a video camera. It's not clever or anything new at all.I'm surprised it has such high ratings. Just over half way through I was thinking ''Nothing has really happened much and it's starting to get really boring.''It's one of those movies that all of a sudden jump to a new character, tone and place unnecessarily half way through when you're not interested in that, you're interested in the people in the basement and their situation and it just drags on this one dude's life that could have been told in like 3 minutes.It also has some stupid stuff happen in it that would never happen, like cops refusing to investigate a life and death situation. They literally just drive off and leave the main character even though they're cops and have to investigate by law, then there's surviving ridiculous fatalities a couple of times..Overall, this movie could have been told in like 1 hour but they dragged it out so much to make up for nothing happening and it's advertised as serious and mysterious but half way through it switches to comedy and the mystery couldn't be more cliché.The villain doesn't really scare you because it doesn't attack you if you're calm and you feel sorry for it so if you're looking for seriously scary then this isn't it. There's like one 1 scary part and that's it. 4/10.",2022-11-15
"This movie was surprisingly suspenseful and actually kept us on our toes. The storyline was not typical and predictable as many movies are these days. Compared to even some recent blockbusters, which in my opinion have not deserved the ratings and successes that they've been awarded, this film is a worthwhile watch and delivers on the thriller and horror that is missing these days. It was actually very nice to see new faces on the screen and new shooting locations. I actually wish that they would have made the movie longer and explored a bit more of the background scenarios of each of the characters. It seems like there's so much more to unload.",2022-11-28
"Okay, this movie actually scared me a bit from the get go.Not because there was anything jumping out, or anything gory or crazy. Simply because Bill Skarsgard is so damn good and makes you question everything going on in the movie.Is he the good guy? Is he terribly, awfully bad? That question stays with you up until his death .... and maybe even after that. He does a great job in this film, even if it is short lived.The first half of the film is so intense and keeps you guessing, that I liked it better than the second half which got a bit ridiculous in some parts. Sometimes the scary thing, isn't as scary as the unknown.But overall, this is a solid horror film that I think stands up with some of the best in 2022.",2023-01-10
Very good horror movie overall.Briefly adressing the people who gave it a lower score because of the irrational decision making: it is the directors movie so go with the story.Yes he could have done things differently e.g. Letting mother take them while they were asleep or let the girl be on her own or with another girl...Ask yourself if it is just physically possible to do what the characters do or even rationally. The answer is yes.Only one extremely bad person in the movie. The way of showing his past and how the story actually began was very well constructed. Maybe a little more dramatic music would have been in place.Very good acting aswell.,2022-10-31
Was a letdown. Alot of things were frustrating and didn't make sense. Movie was little scary and little funny but wasn't great at anything. Rundown neighborhood was off and how all these people were staying there. Justin has gun but fumbled it in key parts twice and once shot wrong person when he can clearly see with light. Bill character was wasted and killed off in 20 minutes. Police once didn't come because No one there and second time didn't take person serious and just drove off. This story was too brief and didn't really say much. Wasn't the worst movie but was waste of a trip to theater.,2022-09-25
"How does this piece of crap currently stand at a 7.1 avg rating?! Mind boggling. There's so much wrong with this movie, almost nothing made logical sense within the script. That ""thing"" is literally Superman and indestructible, the characters make the utmost dumbest choices at all time, nothing connects properly. The ending is beyond stupid as well. At least a bit of decent acting to be seen throughout but not much more than that sadly. I still can't wrap my head around the rather high rating seem here.Anuways this was a 2/10 on a good day. Save your time and don't bother at all with this abomination.",2022-11-16
"My friend and I saw this last night. Neither of us had heard of this film, but we wanted to see a horror movie and we saw that the reviews for this film were great. As soon as the movie began, I realized that I had actually seen the trailer for this movie a few months ago. When I saw the trailer, I actually thought the movie looked interesting.And so the first half of the movie was actually really good. It was everything I expected the movie to show. Georgina Campbell and Bill Skarsgård gave great performances, the scares were thrilling, and I like how the film reflected on Detroit's housing crisis. It's always great when a horror movie has commentary on social issues. The design of monster is also really terrifying.Unfortunately the second half of the film was slightly ruined for me. As soon as the first half ended, the film's tone quickly shifted from its dark and eerie atmosphere to a more lighter tone. It makes the film's overall tone feel inconsistent, and I can't decide at this point if this is supposed to be a horror movie or a horror comedy. Justin Long's character AJ may have been funny at times, but that's why he doesn't belong in this movie. He's just a comic relief character, which sadly made the movie less scary for me. I will say that AJ's character could work in a horror movie, but I don't think Barbarian is that movie. His laughable dialogue made it difficult for me to take this horror movie seriously. You could remove AJ from this movie entirely and it'll be just as good if not better.So the purpose of the monster, known as The Mother, is to treat its prisoners like infants. I will say that this disturbing goal is interesting for a horror movie. The only thing I will say is that the unveiling of this goal seemed kinda rushed, mainly since most of the second half was focused on AJ finding the dungeon.Fortunately, the ending of the film was satisfying, although it felt too short.So yeah, while this film seems to be getting strong reviews from audiences and critics, I'm kinda mixed. The inconsistent tone was a problem and some scenes could've been written better. While the film could've been worse, it could've been better as well. Maybe I had too many expectations going into this film. It might grow on me overtime. Perhaps a second watch will do.",2022-10-02
"Barbarian starts off with the traditional beats of a January-release horror movie. Red promo poster with girl unleashing blood-curdling scream. Check. Innocent girl. Check. Place she's going to not what it appeared to be. Check. Suspicious man lures her into said place. Check. But that's where the box checking ends. This movie is one of the most original and fun horror films I've seen in quite sometime.First, the casting of Bill Skarsgard as Keith is genius. They took an actor known by most audiences as playing a killer clown and make him the prime suspect. He has a creepy aura, despite his good looks, which make you assume guilt. Nice meta red herring. The dialogue between the two keeps you on edge and is impossible to tell if he is a villain up until his face gets smashed into the wall by an inbred monster woman.Ah, there we have it then, that's our Barbarian! But immediately following the squashing of Keith's dome, there is a cut to the nerd from Live Free or Die Hard singing a Donovan song, who, ends up being the actual Barbarian. Justin Long provides a good bit of comedic relief with his shallow attempts at self-preservation right when the horror house seemed a pit played out.This movie manages to defy genre tropes, be genuinely scary and funny, while also deftly providing commentary on who the real monsters are. 9/10.",2023-01-08
"Very entertaining and super creepy but full of plot holes. This movie is a creepy thriller more than a horror movie and I actually didn't like it but I couldn't stop watching.It's very creepy, the monster "" the mother"" is actually a daughter of a rape victim who born in darkness and the predator did what he did for 40 years , kidnapping women, rapping them and having babies, rapping the babies when they grow up and having more babies, that is the most horrific thing i ever watched that's why we don't see it.The movie starts as supernatural thriller, a haunted house trapping people then we discover there is a monster down ( the mother) in the tunnel but who built those tunnels is unknownThen we discover that the monster is actually a victim and the real monster is now old man living at the end of the tunnel with all his disgusting video tapes of his victims using the mother as his servant. How the hell no one caught him?So the hero of this story is a very brave woman and she is trapped with a very bad person an actor who is accused of rape ... he is kind of bad person that really scares you because you won't know how bad he is until it's too late ..and he thinks he is good and he is probably as bad the the old manIt was brilliant when the actor confronted the old man after watching one of the video tapes and was disgusted about it.. and he is as badWhat bother me is that these bad people needed a bad things to happen to them as retribution but unfortunately .. the old guy simply killed himselfBut over all the movie is very enjoyable even if you don't like it and probably you won't like it.If it were up to my opinion I would give it 6.5 cuz of the plot holes but that would be unfair because it touches on important issues .. I just considered it a supernatural or a dumb another dimension and ignored the many many many dumb plot holes.",2023-10-06
"I put this on because a couple friends had recommended it to me, it's not the type of horror I've been tending to go towards but I figured I'd see what it was about and oh my gosh I'm glad I did.I know a lot of reveiwers disagree but I really liked the stark difference in tone for each act, I found it almost slightly disorienting in a way I thought worked well, especially when it switched from Tess to AJ for the first time. And the moods for each scene fit perfectly.I don't want to give away the ending so all I'll say about it was it was perfect. I almost wanted to just hit restart and watch the whole movie again. Very much would recommend to friends (and already am)",2023-01-21
"First 30-40 min were actually somewhat promising. However things took a turn for the worse when the ""barbarian"" showed up and shred the potential of a decent movie to pieces. Incredibly cheap, not at all thought through.Not only did the script turn to sh**, but the acting did as well. A good plot gone to waste by incompetent writers, the embodiment of the barbarian was mediocre at best. The movie felt cheap in every conceivable way.I really don't know what to say, I don't see any reason as to why anyone would want to spend the better part of two hours watching this piece of cinematic junk.I really wouldn't recomend this movie to anyone, don't get fooled by the high score it has somehow gained. This really takes the cake for one of, if not the worst movies I've seen.",2023-03-30
Barbarian is definitely one of the best films of the year without giving away anything. Positives: very suspenseful throughout the film. Acting is top notch across the board. The setting is fantastic for a horror film. It makes you believe it is going a certain direction and then shifts its course. You root for the characters in the film despite all having flaws themselves. I would also say that you should go in knowing next to nothing about this film let it surprise you. No jump scares the horror feels entirely organic and you feel it through the whole film. Negatives: If there is any negatives it's just this the movies basic plot is very similar to don't breathe in that it is set in Detroit and the two antagonists are very similar. But that aside barbarian is an experience you absolutely can't miss out on make sure you see it on the biggest screen possible.,2022-10-02
This was horribly written and executed. The characters are total idiots with no real common sense. It wasn't even really scary just f$#);!g disturbing and gross. I wasted my time and money on this move that I thought would be really good turns out absolutely not. I love scary movies but this was just a total disgrace to all scary movies! Michael Myers would not approve!! The only good thing about this is Bill Skarsgard. I feel like I need to shower in beach and get a therapist. Bill is the only reason this even gets 2 stars!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! I'm sad because I actually was excited to see this.,2022-10-15
"It was a total waste of time, a repeated story, a man who is raping women to have children and such a childlish story line. Oh my God. You should not watch it. I wonder how the score is 7,5 for a movie which must be 2 or 3. I will never suggest this movie to anyone. I have seen the storyline many times in other movies . It is not even worth to waste your time. Not suggested at all. A stupid girl is trying to save everyone and such stupid things happening. The only problem i have is with this fake rate it has. I swear to God it does not deserve more than 2. It cannot be comparable with any good movies.",2022-10-26
"I played this movie out of curiosity. I didn't read the description and when I tried to watch the trailer, I didn't dare to finish it thinking it might only spoil me. In the middle of watching, I was really curious what was happening in the movie. I created a lot of assumptions on who might be the enemy or what might happen. I can't stay still on my seat and I kept covering my eyes (of course leaving a hole to peak so that I could still watch lmao) because it really gives me that thrill. Especially when that deformed woman started showing up, I can't help but to quietly scream.All in all, this movie will keep you wondering what might happen next. I don't know, maybe it's just me but I couldn't predict what might happen not until the movie started showing hints about the old man and the obsession of the deformed woman. To be honest, I feel bad for the deformed woman. She may have killed humans but it wasn't her fault why she turned out like that. She must have suffered a lot considering how monstrous her father or grandfather was. I love the contrast between the characters. In the end, it was AJ who ended up being the enemy and it was the deformed girl who actually have a soft heart. She may look bad physically but all she ever wanted was to take care of her 'baby'.It was a good watch. Love the suspense, the camera works/motion and the cast did pretty well. I think my only complaint is that there are some scenes that are impossible. To mention one, that part when the deformed woman teared off the homeless man's arm just by pulling, there's no way in hell that's impossible. The woman may look like a monster but there's no way she had that kind of strength. Also, I guess that ending wasn't as satisfying as I expected it to be. Sure she did won, she killed the deformed woman even if she knows that that woman has experienced something awful turning her into who she is now/was. And AJ died, I guess that serves as his karma for the bad things he'd done. But there's something missing. I could not tell what but it didn't give me satisfaction. But the movie was really okay, if you would ask me, I would like you to give it a try. It's worth it. You might have questions but you can just google it to better understand after watching the movie.",2022-10-29
"I never leave movie reviews but I felt compelled to warn others that watching this film will leave you frustrated & underwhelmed. Despite the hype, 7.4 rating & the well-known actors, its just plain nonsensical. You're basically just anxiously awaiting a reveal that never comes, one that'll finally unite all the ambiguous half-plots & provide answers to the myriad of unanswered questions; the plots were baffling, weak, & riddled with holes which, in the end, WAS the essence of the entire film (not even in a hip ""open-to-interpretation"" indie-film kinda way). No idea the vibe they're aiming for.",2022-10-27
"My friends and I had a lot more fun watching this movie than we anticipated it's definitely not perfect in any way. It also isn't the scariest film, by the second half I had clenched a few times. The first half definitely were the best parts. It was slow but tensions were high. Bill Skaarsgard definitely was the standout actor, he helped keep the tensions up. The second half of the film is not bad like people were saying. It was bit frustrating that it slowed down for a little and Justin Long's character was horrible but by the time the house showed back up it still felt like it went back to where it left off. It was pretty scary at times and I was personally interested in the where the story went and the lore of that house and I wasn't left dissatisfied like the majority of horror films. We laughed a couple of times at the end but lets be real most horror film you bust out laughing a lot at how stupid it is.",2022-10-31
"Flaming pile of garbage! I adore Bill Skarsgard, the beginning of this was great with him in it and then it took a nose dive after you discover what's in the basement. Did not like Justin Long's character at all. I kept expecting it to get better but it didn't. Maybe just watch the beginning of this and then skip the rest. Don't waste your time! Maybe it would have been better if they found pennywise in the basement. Or leatherface. Or jason. Or the whole cast from Scream. Or Rob Zombie. Anyone at all would have been more interesting than what was down there. My 14 year old even thought this was ridiculous!",2022-10-27
"Two better titles for this movie would have been ""Resting B***h Face"" or ""No, Do the Opposite"".The movie is an accurate depiction of America: ruined neighborhoods, poverty, old people living way too long and wallowing in the evil they've done, young people who react to every setback with entitled annoyance, public institutions that refuse to function.On a meta level, this movie is also emblematic of American pop culture: the buzz around this movie is overblown, as noob movie watchers try to make it out to be amazing, when it is actually very basic and mediocre.It's common in horror films for the protagonists to split up when they shouldn't, or to open doors that they shouldn't. It is notable that in this movie, every action that each protagonist takes is the exact opposite of what they should do.On a side note, what really ruined this movie for me was the trailer. Whoever put that trailer together should be fired.",2022-11-17
The worst piece of work I've seen rated 7.4 (?). What is going on with IMDB. This is a solid 1. I am very disappointed. And I watched it free by the miracle of torrent. And still I am pissed. I can't imagine the frustration of people actually paying money to see this crap on the big screen. No surprise movie theaters are going bankrupt. What else can I write about this piece of work. I still have 201 characters. But the movie doesn't even deserve to be criticized seriously. Oh my god! 7.4? Really? What for? For the non-existent thrill? Cheap plot? That flashback with 3rd person camera work which adds nothing to the plot. I'm done. I hope people who rate this movie 7.4 just burn in the deepest dungeons of hell.,2022-10-26
"The first thing I'd like to say about this film is that they definitely nailed the prosthetics for the ""mother"" character. Truly transforming and terrifying. I'm also fairly biased because I'm familiar with the actor that played the mother being that he's a Broadway performer that was in one of my all time favorite musicals, ""Side Show"", where he also wore prosthetics! His way of being terrifing quickly flipped to somewhat endearing towards the end of the film was truly a feat! The story was okay...as is every horror movie...un needed middle plot lines and a rushed ending not really focusing on the things we want to know about! But overall a solid horror film. Don't think it's the best of the year though! I preferred both smile and black phone!",2022-11-13
"So far, Barbarian, is horror of the year for me. Yes, it has the usual horror tropes, but the movie takes you on a ride that is unpredictable and thrilling. Make some popcorn, get on the couch and enjoy some good family fun.The story goes places that you don't expect. Great performances from Georgina Campbell and Justin Long. Bill Skarsgard is genius casting in the role of creepy accidental room mate.A girl is stranded in a rather run down town in Detroit, her air bnb is double booked and after agreeing to stay the night her life certainly becomes interesting.A brilliant comment on how women are vulnerable and powerless because of the weakness and cruelty of men.The directing is tight and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I can't wait to see more from Zach Cregger.",2022-12-06
"It's good enough to watch, some gorely scenes you expected, more than average as a horror movie.First half is quite good, couldn't guess what was going to happen next then towards to the end, a bit disappointed. Still entertaining to watch until the end. Especially going down to the basement to see what is there was very scary,and thrilling. I enjoyed that part.Ending could be better, typically a scary character is hard to kill and being chased after for a while. Could guess how it ended after all.Two third of the movie is good but last 30 minutes ruined it, boring ending despite a quite good story.",2022-12-09
"If the movie followed the same flow as the first act it would have been award winning horror. The mystery and second guessing of motives could have made a full length horror even with some elements of the last acts. The utter lack of utilizing skaarsgard for most of the movie kind if upset me.Unfortunately it turns into basically 2 different movies of 2 different horror genres which, of the 2, the first act is my preference. (Psychological / mystery vs basically a slasher flick)Still, it has its charm and interesting characters worth a full watch if you start it. Don't expect anything profound, though, that ship sailed after the first act.",2023-01-25
"Barbarian is by far an underrated film in the horror community because after it had its prime for September, it had been forgotten 3 months later. Rewatching this movie, I realized that this film could've played longer. Maybe 20-35 minutes perhaps. That way, I would get the full story because 70% of this film was just character development and while the film tried a lot to make it suspenseful the last 30 minutes, I could not find myself loving this film. I like the film but it needed so much more. The potential was great but it wasn't where I could love this film. It wasn't perfectly executed and it's okay. However, the last 30 minutes were well done and kept me hooked. The ending was a bit stingy but this film and Pearl tie first place for best horror movie in 2022.",2023-07-05
"Barbarian can be considered an evolution of the typical ""psychological horror"" movie, where we can find the female protagonist going into a house and encountering the worst monstrosities.More in detail, the movie plays a lot on the unexpected evolution of the story, especially around the character of Keith: I believe everyone who watched the movie thought Keith was a sadistic psychopath, because that's exactly the intent of the movie, and I must say it was really effective.I appreciated the idea of ""unlocking"" new areas of the house with the progression of the story because it grew my curiosity and kept my attention to the movie high for its entire duration.However, I think too many narrations were inserted in the plot, and, as a consequence, they weren't appropriately deepened (for instance, the previous owner of the house's story, who apparently used to kidnap women by breaking into their dwellings).Hence, I felt like many pieces of the puzzle were missing, many questions I had remain unanswered, and, to me, it feels like also many additional scenes of this movie are missing.Also, I couldn't empathize with any character because, in my opinion, they weren't adequately described and deepened: we know barely nothing about their lives and especially about their personality... They're quite flat.I'd consider this movie an evolution of the typical psychological horror movie, however, it didn't succeed at overcoming the annoying clichés that characterize this genre, as the uselessness of police, the stupid character who ventures in terrifying places (sometimes even without any weapon), the victim being unable to escape the killer because of the multiple falls to the ground, and the character calling out to someone like ""is anyone there?!"" - Of course there couldn't be anybody good down there, watcha think?Finally, a few words about the ending: unsatisfactory and nonsense, in my opinion. The actual owner of the house gets brutally killed by the monster, who becomes attached to Tess (?) ... And how come she survived such a fall? How come did she end up laying on the monster if she was the first one to fall? Why on earth would the guy be so stupid to wait for the monster to kill him?In a nutshell: 6/10 also because I feel like this movie didn't leave any particular emotion or reflection, nor it taught me anything. I just appreciated the unexpectedness of the many plot twists and the expansion of the areas of the narration (hence, of the plot too), even though many scenes were definitely predictable (for instance, the previous owner shooting himself on his deathbed).",2023-09-24
"They're always stupid?They completely blew off Tess despite parking right in front of two clean/nice looking cars which might indicate there was someone else there and you'd think they'd check if they were stolen which would give all the info they need... right?But idk, it was a good movie, was more of a drama with a twist of horror. It would have been interesting to see it delve more into the backstory and see other moments with the ""mother"" also why did the bloke do what he did, was the director just going for a Fritzl storyline, or... what. The awkward interactions between Tess and Keith could have been cut a little shorter and we could have had more interactions with the ""mother"" at least, I think.",2023-01-10
"Great movie. Best horror movie IVE seen in a longggg time and I absolutely LOVE horror. Terrifying jump scares, AMAZING cinematography, great direction, wonderful plot and the most shocking plot twist ever. You'll be so sure it's heading one way for a good 45 minutes and then it switches and then 30 minutes later it changes more and then in the last 5 minutes everything makes sense. I'm keeping this spolier free so I'm being vague but GO SEE THIS MOVIE, it's definitely a ""what the eff did I just watch"" kinda movie in the best way possible! Also great actors. There wasn't one single actor that was cheesy or cringy to watch! Amazing amazing amazing.",2022-09-18
"First of all, who gets a air bnb and doesn't look at it on Google maps before they go. Who ends up in the hood and decides they'll stay the night. The characters are stupid and make dumb decisions. It's definitely not scary. It has a great cast and it had the potential to be a really good scary movie. Richard Brake is a great actor, he plays a good killer and they could of made this a amazing movie. Justin Long is very talented and they wasted it in this movie. They took it in the wrong direction. It's worth watching if you can see it cheap but if you're looking for really scary you'll be disappointed. It's ok and as far as new movies it's ok but it's just ok. Great cast, ok plot, bad execution on it though.",2022-09-14
This was supposed to be The scariest movie of 2022 but I am honestly not impressed. I do not like horror movies but my best friend convinced me to see this one with her. I went in thinking it was gonna be really scary but it really wasn't that scary. There were solid like maybe 10 jump scares. If they're being rated R I would've thought that there would've been more gore. Like towards the end of the movie the woman rips this guys arm off and then ripped his body in half but it doesn't show what the guys body looks like after she rips him in half. There also wasn't enough backstory explanation. We don't really get to know why the dad was Loring girls into the basement or what he was doing with them in the basement and it's kind of implied but I wish that there was more of a backstory and that it gave more information. It's almost like they were trying to leave imagination for the person watching but they left too many holes in the plot line that it just didn't make sense. But if you can get past all of that then it's a great movie.,2022-09-19
"I was not fortunate enough to watch this movie in theatre. However, watched it after its digital release.The director experimented so many things with this film. There were some Lovecraftian spice, fear of unknown, psychopaths, serial killings, horror, drama and what not.Cinematography was good. Could have been lot better but still works great. The whole film was shot with a steady choreography. Yet, you could see some scenes, where cameraman failed to stabilize the shot. Can't tell if it were done on purpose but the movie isn't a ""Shaky"" fest to begin with.Amazing acting though. No complain there. Each and every actor utilized the creepy environment of the set perfectly. Bill did some amazing scores during his screentime.But all good things must come to an end, right? The direction was weak. Even though Zach wrote and directed the movie himself; can't tell which one was weaker (or maybe both were weak?!). And I honestly think the transition from first half to second half literally ruined the movie. It was a questionable choice to include someone completely different in the second half out of nowhere. The scandalous backstory of the second protagonist didn't help the movie in any progressive way. Heck, it even felt like a completely different film after the first half. The party ended exactly right there sadly.Overall, the movie DID have an amazing strong first-half. I give the first-half a solid 8 and the second half a piss-poor 5. You can try watching this movie out but don't raise your hope too high. And DON'T EAT ANYTHING DURING SECOND HALF. Ciao!",2022-11-14
"Barbarian is a movie that creeped me out for almost two hours which succeeded in creating a dark and tense mood since its first minutes.I saw this movie without knowing a thing about it other than the IMDb's plot and I have to say that's the best way to watch it as even one single picture can ruin the experience for you.The movie basically begins as a cliché but quickly takes an unexpected turn, leaving you shocked halfway through.The acting is really good and the cinematography is beautiful. I also tought that the story could have been told as a miniseries composed by 3 or 4 episodes but I'm glad that it came out as a movie as it's far more condensed and well paced.I can't deny that there are some classic clichés but I still very much liked this experience and in my opinion many horror lovers are gonna agree that this is one of 2022's best movies of this genre.",2022-11-03
"I went in to this movie with great expectations, having seen the trailer, witnessed the positive reviews whilst dodging all spoilers. Having seen it I have to say it was a surprise, and an experience that took a lot of time to process. I wasn't really sure how I felt about it for a couple of days after watchingFirstly I'll start with the aspects of the film that I really liked from the get go. The first 40 minutes was superb, filled with tension and two gripping performances. The movie takes some surprising turns, and some of these really worked for me. When the movie resets after the first true glimpse of horror, it essentially turns into a black comedy for the following 30 minutes in a subplot which seemed like an extended deleted scene from 'Promising Young Woman'. There were plenty of cringey laughs to be had during this sequence, which sets up the campy tone of the final act of the movie.Once Barbarians secrets are out in the open and it shows its hand, it turns into a over-the-top thrill ride which amuses as much as it horrifies. It's a little disappointing that the tension which was so present in the first act goes missing from the climax, however I enjoyed the ride it took me on. I appreciate that they did something original, even if it wasn't quite what I wanted it to be.This is a horror film that subverts expectations, takes risks and has something to say. I respect it as much as I had fun watching it.Not perfect, but a damn fun time at the cinema.",2022-11-07
"Okay, THIS is how horror/thriller movies should be made.Dark, creepy, unsettling. The movie eases you into the actual Horror portion, like an old man sitting down in his recliner. Until then everything that happens is plenty interesting enough to keep you attentive.Personally, as much as i love the horror/ slasher genre, it's not actually SCARY, if the premise is too unbelievable: Freddy, Jason, Michael... they're all invincible, which is implausible, so they don't really scare me.Barbarian, however, was truly scary & actually a little unsettling. Which makes for a damn good horror flick.The music, the camera angles, etc were all excellent as well.I honestly hope there isn't a sequel, bc it would likely would soften the impact of this truly unsettling, disturbing, deliciously creepy, fantastic movie.Go see it!",2022-09-26
"I will freely admit that I had no knowledge of this film or expectations going in, and that absolutely made this film a far better watch. So if you have not seen it yet and want to make the most out of it, stop your research, turn your brain off, and enjoy this 100 minute film.This film has a significant mix of feelings towards it, some critics feel it is a dark and suspense film that any horror film will love, others look down on the film as it has as many holes as a very distressed pair of jeans. Although these two perspectives seem at odds with each other, when you combine the views together you get a great sense of how the film actually is. Although I enjoyed the film I will be the first to poke holes in the story, some of these issues are minor and simply requires the viewer to 'look the other way', such as our protagonist somehow not realising the Airbnb she booked was in the middle of an abandoned town, a one medical conference somehow selling out every hotel in Detroit. These can be looked over and explained away, it is not rare for Airbnb listings to use very specific and misleading photos, and she gave up after only phoning one hotel so there was probably some free. I am giving particular attention to these plot holes as this seems to be where most criticism for the film comes from, and although I am not trying to defend the film and I am certainly not paid by the production house (although I wish I was) I think as reviewers and critics we should not throw unfair criticism at a film, nor dismiss genuinely skillful filmmaking simply due to some parts not making total sense.That is the core of my feelings towards this film, that despite the plot holes, it is still a great film and this reflects how incredibly good this film is. As there is so much skillful film making and writing, that it makes these plot holes inconsequential because how well made the film is makes you look past a lot of it. At the core of what makes this film great is the suspense, as a horror film only works for as long as it holds suspense, maintaining and building this throughout the film is what builds this film up. Not only the ability to hold suspense, but being able to create it, to reach a climax of suspense then very shortly manage to build it back up. This is done especially well through hiding information from the viewer, such as showing you creepy rooms and areas but not explicitly telling you what happened in them, letting the viewer imagine what happened as their mind spirals with possibilities as the film does not let up on the tension. Keeping the setting purposefully dark and using a strong soundtrack to continually build the tension as you are left constantly guessing what will happen next... or who will appear next. This is done no where better but in the first 35 minutes of the film, where tension is built slowly but surely and culminates in a strong climax, so skillfully done that the film could have ended there and it would have made a reasonably satisfying short film. However, and rather unfortunately, it does not.I am purposefully admitting spoilers from this review as I do not feel they need to be included in order to express my feelings on this film, in light of that however, upon watching the film you will absolutely be able to tell exactly which part of the film I discuss in the following sentence. The cut from the major climax of the first 35 minutes is the most jarring and sudden cut I have ever seen in a film, I had intense neck pain during this film solely due to this cut. I will not discuss it at length because it is not terribly relevant to the review, however, I mention it as it is typical of my main issue with the film. It is not a film, it is three short films in a coat pretending to be a full one. Those three are; the first thirty five minutes which is an exemplary horror experience built with tension, the second is a horror-comedy which is more typical of the Scary Movie parodies which slowly shifts into the final form of the film, which is an gore fest slasher film. This is such a significant problem as there are so many great things about the film, although the film is in essence just three loosely connected short films, each of those are incredibly enjoyable and done well. Which is why despite the constant shifts in focus, I still enjoyed the film. The writing is skillful, it is incredibly believable, due in no small part to the impressive performances throughout. All the core characters feel so real, their decisions are realistic and actually intelligent, they are not bumbling fools which are put in harrowing situations due to pure stupidity, yet they are not unrealistically intelligent or skilled. This is so relieving as many horror films are based solely on the idea that the characters are as intelligent as a small child, although that is an insult to small children if I am honest. Further, the sin is not committed of making all the characters so unlikable that we almost want them to die, although one character does fit this bill, as most we want to see get through it all which only adds to the tension. A final key point about the production of this film is the gore, it is exquisite, any gore fan is bound to get their fill from this film. Although it may have some more squeamish viewers looking away, after all what do you expect from a horror film? Combine all of this with skilled direction to pull it all together you have a genuinely well made film where everyone barring on person did their job well, even the location scout did amazingly, although there are not a lot of different locations, what we do see helps build that ever important suspense. The one person who did not do their job well, however, is unfortunately the most important one, that being the script writer.This may seem a tad contradictory, after all I did praise the character writing and various parts of the film, however the core issue is down to the writing, that being the mismatch of themes. And this makes up my conclusion on this film, that although almost everything is done supremely well, the foundations of the film are the sand it all sinks through. The plot holes and mismatching of themes throughout the film really let it down, which is honestly what I hate most about this film, yes hate. I hate how much wasted potential there is, I hate how everything is so well done yet the plot and flow of the film breaks it all, it makes me feel bad for the actors, set designers, composer, location scout, producers, special effects artists, and even the audience. So much is done well yet it is let down by a lack of such basic film making principles; make the plot flow, keep a consistent theme, and ensure the plot at the very least makes total sense. It fails on these fronts, yet I cannot deny how well done everything else is, surprisingly so considering how the mostly skillful direction is done by the same guy who wrote the rather poor plot. And this is why I feel this is still a worthwhile watch for any horror veteran or noobie, you will get your film of suspense, scares, and gore from this film and if you can shut your brain off, a decent watch.Thank you for taking the time to read my review, have a wonderful day.",2023-01-18
"I concur with the other reviewers who suggest that going into this film blind makes for the optimal viewing experience. From the start the film is mysterious and shimmeringly creepy. The tension between Tess and Keith is riveting - in part due to their excellent portrayals, and there are some genuinely edge-of-your seat scares - in the first 40 minutes. The weird-deformed-screeching-mother twist doesn't exactly land, and once it's foist upon you, you're immediately removed from the horror and the atmosphere that's been established, as the film abruptly cuts to an entirely new character joy-riding somewhere entirely else. The twist renders much of the preceding events implausible in the extreme and strains credulity, even for a horror. Keith and Tess were such strong characters and it was a mistake to make the film about so many other things - #metoo, the cops are bad, etc. - when a more traditional horror route focusing on their characters could have been excellent. Originality for the sake of originality seems not to have worked in this case. Nevertheless, I had a lot of fun watching this and there were certainly funny moments, scary moments, good music. Don't go in expecting a masterpiece and you might not be too disappointed.",2022-10-02
"It must be hard to make an original horror movie, especially when the subgenre is the haunted house, because it's all been done before. That's no reason not to try for an original slant, but besides good writing and acting, what can the movie do to transcend its tired tropes?""Barbarian"" feels it must be woke, so the subterranean ghoul that haunts the house is the product of a violent, white, male psychopath's evil scheme to hold generations of victims hostage and document their incest and death in his own video library; the heroine is an attractive young black woman, Tess; and the man who owns the house that she rents while in town for a job interview is a white male accused of rape. In other words, we have three monsters: one a female victim of virulent white male psychopathy; one an immature, narcissistic, white male sex offender from California who visits his long-lost property to get it ready for sale after losing his job in the wake of the rape charge; and the third an emotionless white male who lived next door before white flight and then became progenitor of the generic monster, the woman haunting the house, who only wants to suckle her victims.The moral compass of the movie is a black homeless man who, while trying to warn the protagonist not to enter the house after her fellow renter, Keith, disappears into the catacombs, at first appears to be another monster that she barely escapes. Later the audience is admonished for that assumption when the protagonist talks to Victor and learns from him the horrifying history of the house. But what else are we to assume about a babbling man in pursuit, even if he is yelling: ""Do not go into that house!""? To be fair, we are also invited to make assumptions about Keith's friendly intentions with Tess, but he proves to be awkward and kind, not on the make like A. J., and, again, Keith soon succumbs to the beast, the raging white female archetype of abuse, never to be heard from again.After gouging out the eyes of the homeowner, AJ, the monster kills herself, as does Frank, the violent psychopath, also a white male, after he is confronted in his dying days by AJ. In his (Frank's) decrepit home down the street. These are the barbarians; take your pick. The movie executes each, and this is the new slant, for the generic trope is to let the demon live so that we can all leave the theater in fear of its return.What happens to Tess? Nothing she can't handle. But exactly why she descends the tunnel beneath the basement when she knows that the kind of harm that befell Keith awaits her does nothing to bolster her competence.",2022-09-23
"I thought this movie was entertaining and well done. I see a lot of negative recent reviews that I do not agree with. I have seen much worse horror type movies than this so I'm not sure what made them dislike this movie so much. Maybe they were expecting more gore or something along those lines and felt cheated when they left out certain things. Do not go into this expecting your typical horror movie filled with gruesome deaths. I felt the way they portrayed all the violence was done tastefully for the most part, just enough but not overdone. Definitely a slow burn with different plots that all come together which is why I viewed it as more of a scary thriller than a horror movie. Certain aspects don't exactly make sense but it's a movie. They have to do things people in the real world would not necessarily do to move the plot along. Typical scary movie type things like them going down a sketchy hallway when it's clear they should leave. I tried to write this without spoilers so I'm leaving out some minor nit picking but overall I was happy I watched this. Just under two hours and it flew by, I was entertained the entire time and was curious what was going to happen next and how it was all going to come together. Well worth the watch if you don't go into it expecting a saw type horror movie or something with a lot of jump scares.",2022-11-29
"The movie starts with a good premise and a good setup, they definitively built suspense during the first third of the movie and they have characters one can care about even if they are quite strange, specially the man.But once the suspense of the first third broken the quality of the movie starts to drop though it seems that it may be saved until the super natural element makes its apparition, then the movie just goes off the rails.Finally when everything seems lost it appears the director make an actual effort to fail big. The ending is so terrible and laughable but not in a funny way, in a sad way where you know you and your peers at the cinema just wasted 2 hours of their lives they are never going to get back.",2022-10-08
"Barbarian is a headtrip shockfest, a conglomerate of suspenseful atmosphere and gonzo violence. It is as smart as any ""prestige"" horror film and as demented as any recent theatrical release. Barbarian boldly plays to both crowds and manages to carry each tune equally well.The principle cast deserves tremendous credit for creating a web of interesting characters that anchor the insanity. Georgina Campbell and Justin Long especially work to get the audience invested amidst the high octane chaos. Bill Skarsgård sizzles in the role that sets everything off balance.A startling (and spoilable) premise is rocket fuel for the many twists and turns. The effects are viscerally brutal. Barbarian knows exactly when to hold back and when to go full throttle.There aren't many movies like Barbarian, it is a unique and confident ride. It speaks to horror fans of different dispositions and splits the difference in a remarkable way. It is fascinatingly sturdy as a directorial debut and new idea, finding footing in different segments of the genre. It is above all just a powerful, well-made movie and it leaves a mark that is not soon to be forgotten.",2023-02-20
"A great horror movie. Great story, great acting, great practical and visual effects, an unsettling atmosphere and some unexpected twists. I couldn't help myself from saying out loud ""What the hell are you doing?"" several times throughout the movie, which was pretty funny and hasn't happened in a while. I imagine that the writer had that in mind intentionally. I also liked the cinematography during the Richard Brake introduction scene. That choice made it pretty unsettling as well. If you like horror, you'll surely love this one. The way the story is told was also refreshing and made it more engaging.",2022-11-12
"Well, I don't understand all the 8+/10. I watched this movie expecting nothing but it seemed to be well received by the early viewers.The first half of the movie appeared to be building a solid intrigue but as it unfold, meh. There's sooo many plot holes, the ending is mediocre and even cliché just like the ""We don't believe you"" police scene"".There's some positive tho:
The movie doesn't heavily rely on jump-scare. But it's not really a scary movie by any means. I don't know what people saying ""this is the best horror movie I've seen"" have smoked before watching this.The run-time is good because you'll almost want to fast-forward at some point.Should you watch it? Maybe, but don't expect anything.",2022-10-28
"Now, I didn't go in to make fun of it or be one of those negative reviewers to pick out stuff, quite opposite, although my gut told me it might be badish, I wanted find good in it and enjoy it.I'll admit I enjoyed it, sadly at times at its expense. The beginning was (at least felt) excelent, but the longer movie went on the more... disappointed(?) it made me feel.The acting was good, would have to rewatch it to pick out some mistakes (and thats good), I liked Keith and Tess was cool too, kinda left me invested, the visuals and camera work were also good (especially act 3 felt that way), the plot... now that is where things get... well worse-ish. (I mean ther is also sound design, but nothing to really talk about)I'll try avoiding spoilers.So the main issue is human brain, and it's ability to think, because the more you stop to think about what is happening, the less it makes sense. There is quite a lot of stupid stuff, not even counting the setup into it.There are few things brought up that never get resolved or anything, when they set up the new character I thought it meant something, like some bigger message, but not really. I have a feeling there was an attempt, like few things mentioned at the begining, the latter character background and few other thing, they hint at some social message about man-woman relations and positions in society. Yet not really, is the main ""thing"" of matter? - Not really... when you longer think about that with all given background and hints, it still aint much making sense, why is it like that (the look and backstory is explainable but also the explanation isnt really making sense in possibility)
It's like anthology but also not, 2nd act brings you right back to the house, 3rd is past, so the plot is around this house, which also is surprising why is it still looking so neat compared to the neighborhood.Who is the title Barbarian? I dunno, the guy from the past? Polish title hints at plurar, so are we the baddies? But for real it must be that guy.I kind of liked the paranoia and the play on the villany at the beginning (or something like that), maybe it subverted someone's expectations, not mine, nothing really except for few moments surprised me (the ""rooftop"" scene lol), although I just knew I'm going to root for my boy Skarsgard.I might write another review or remake this one but with spoilers because it's kind of hard working around them and makes me not give out all my thoughts :/It's also a slowburner, and I love me some good slowburner - I seriously loved The Night House - but this one, it's a bit boring, but not way too boring, but because of that you spend time thinking about the movie while watching it, so you get to conclusions of this movie not being too smart to put it simply.The movie is quite a mess, going different directions, with one idea vaguely glueing all that together.In summary, this movie was... enjoyable, nonsensical and well to be completly honest - crappy, but I think some people can find it entertaining.The rating fits between 4 and 6 out of 10, which isn't that bad, but also not very good, as mentioned still fine-ish.PS: What was that mirror construction supposed to be, it didnt give any light there anyway... >:(",2023-01-20
"This movie had a lot of potential. The beginning was very good and well made. All the way up to the las 30 minutes the movie had me really loving it. The end felt rushed, corny and not so well made. It was liked they switched directors... the movie had a particular ambiance that it lost. Even though the movies ending is disappointing I still gave it a 6. If the movie would have kept the same direction it would definitely be a 7 or even an 7.5 for me.I also felt like they had a lot of room to add a plot twist or at least a little more thought to the plot.The movie is a good watch for someone that is searching for a kind of relaxing horror movie with not a lot of scares but intense moments and even some comedic parts too.",2023-08-20
"What a boring movie.What about this was good/ what did people like about it? I found it terribly predictable. Sure the kills weee great, but there weee like, two. Other than that you could see everything coming right away. It's like the hills have eyes but in a basement.... The basement has eyes. I haven't been this disappointed since Nicholas Cage's Wickerman. What a waste of damn time. I'm surprised I made it all the way with out turning it off. I think it would've done better as a short. Like, keep the first act and end it there. Justin Long was beyond terrible and so cringey. It was just really dumb.",2022-10-27
"All things considered before I get into the problems of this movie.. I'm glad they didn't reveal much in the trailer. This is a lost art and it considerably made this movie more suspenseful.That being said, this movie is a disaster. I'll go so far to say that the first twenty minutes of this film is INCREDIBLE. It has a clever Psycho vibe without trying to blatantly rip it off. The movie then proceeds to blatantly rip off every terrible horror movie ever made in the second half. My positive note about the movie being unpredictable and not revealing much? Yeah, kind of its downfall too. Unpredictable being that it felt like 20 different writers worked on this and nobody thought of establishing a back story or rules. It's just atrocious.A 3 seems VERY high but the first twenty minutes is so good that I'm willing to bump it from being a 1. That's a tribute to the actors involved. Should have just stuck with that concept.",2022-11-15
"I went to the cinema not knowing much about the film having seen just the beginning of the trailer on youtube. One of the youtube comments talked about how great the trailer was made because it did not give too much away - I wanted to know even less than the trailer reveals so I didn't finish it. It turned out to be a good decision. I didn't even know that one of my favourite actors (JT) was in it!The film doesn't follow the classic formula of a scary film which is refreshing. It gives you the scares and the laughs despite a low budget (you don't perceive the low budget when watching it, I only found out how low it was afterwards). There's even some romance there.At one point, I was so scared I wanted to leave the cinema but the film had hooked me in so much that I stayed. It was also a good laugh; I laughed out loud several times (when JT's character starts googling and when GC's character says ""Nope"" were hillarious).Loved the film, loved the ending, gives us more like this!",2022-11-24
"...Tiddy... horror...?This movie did scare me, but after a day or so of thinking about it, I had more questions than answers. It was quite long. It kept you guessing. A lot of tropes were used and it felt like when writing the film they went down the list of ""Ok what do people find scary...""
basement? Check! The dark? Check! Abduction? Check! Breastfeeding? Chec- wait, huh?I just have so many questions that I don't think I'll get the answer to. So with that I tried to just suspend disbelief and get scared and like I said, I did find it scary.I thought the acting was good. I would suggest not to think too much during this film.",2022-11-01
"O. M. G. What in the watered down, copy driven, material is this?! The suspense is incredible the first 40 minutes but the story drifts off in a unbelievable story. A movie directed by a GenZ-er who became inspired by other movies...notably, Don't Breathe.It's hard to find a lot of what the characters do, believeable or make sense in reality; think too much of the story is based on reality, with characters that we aren't supposed to like. This movie isn't even about an Air BnB rental...instead it focuses on social commentary about people in modern day America.This movie is originally bad and weak.",2022-10-26
"We still do not know who is responsible for double booking that listing! I appreciate the misdirect but I think it is only right to see who is behind setting things off! Maybe some parts were not meant to make sense, but there was a lot happening that could have been prevented with a simple call to customer service because AirBNB will find you another listing! And why did Keith go so far? Did he have something to prove?Pretty solid film though. I actually think it was pretty clever. But the double booking has really set in my psyche and I think it is integral information that the viewer should be made aware of. 😆",2022-11-23
"The homeless man said she was a copy of a copy of a copy, and she was 40 years old. The ""dad"" looked to be 45 when he started this whole thing. Let's say his daughters were 16 when he gets them pregnant. That's 45+16. First daughter would be normal. Now he's 61. So he'll have another daughter, 61+16 is 77 years old. This daughter might be a little messed up, but nothing like that really deformed woman. So he'll have to have another daughter, 77+16 is 93 years old. Maybe this is the deformed lady and she has to age 40 years. So we're supposed to believe this man 133 years old? Even if the first incested daughter was that deformed he'd have to be 77+40 is 117 years old. Either way you look at it the math doesn't add up. I guess the writers didn't think about what they writing. The dad shouldn't have been in the basement, more deformed women should have been because he would have died of old age before the last daughter turned 40.I did think the acting was really good. I didn't like the way it ended, but it wasn't a terrible movie. I could tell they tried to make it an interesting storyline without it being as disturbing as, say, the hills have eyes.",2022-10-11
"The first act was promising, but after the introduction of the third main character, the entire movie becomes a disgraceful mess. Many of the aspects the film contains in the latter half of the film just don't make sense. The main antagonist, this horribly disfigured ""woman"" is keeping prisoners to baby them. Really, this thing is supposed to be an inbred human, but it hardly resembles anything human at all. Somehow this woman has all this strength and height, sprinting at it's targets and bashing them or dragging them off. It just doesn't make sense. The main highlights of this film are the set design, and the uncertainty presented with Bill Skarsgard's character, ""Keith"". The beginning of the movie works well with the confusion of the two people renting the same house as they find hidden doors and discover a system of tunnels and dungeons. It is to guess whether Keith is responsible for what occurs through the first section of the movie, and with his connections to Georgina Campbell's ""Tess"", there is a pheasable suspicion of the character. However, after Keith dies, the movie comes to a screeching halt only to being in this character, ""AJ"". His entire backstory not only takes up enough time to make you think it matters, only to do absolutely nothing with. The entire point of his character was to die, and preserve the cliche of the final girl as with many other subpar horror films. At one point in this film the Detroit neighborhood is shown in the era in which it was populated and well lit. The man shown to own the house later seen as an Airbnb, it is implied that he created this tunnel system to carry out his serial offences and live there for the rest of his life. How this was done, I couldn't say. The entire premise of renting that property is bizarre. Who rented the house in the first place? And why would anyone rent it? Let alone two people, on the same night. This movie is ultimately uncomfortable and unrealistic, by it's own standard. If the film had ended after the death of Keith and before the introduction of AJ, it would have been a decent short horror film. AJ, and everything succeeding his introduction, is a bloody mess.",2022-09-21
"I'm truly puzzled by some of the terrible ratings that other reviewers have given this movie. I'm a big fan of horror movies and am always searching for genuinely good horror movies because let's face it, there aren't that many out there.I saw Smile at the cinema recently and even though I thought it was fantastic it didn't make me jump as much as I did during my viewing of Barbarian. And I'm really not easily scared by any horror movies. I've seen many terrible horror movies, the number of which far outweighs the ones I'd give high praise to. However, this one does a great job of building suspense and genuine fear for the main characters. It always keeps you guessing and I never knew what was going to happen from one minute to the next. Also, the acting was really great.Yes the main characters do make some silly decisions at times but for goodness sake it's a horror film, what do you expect? Why are some people so hung up on films not being ""realistic"" enough? Is this film supposed to be based on true events?Tess, the main character, does have the opportunity to leave the house on a few occasions but chooses not to, for reasons I understood, I wouldn't say it was stupid or dumb (like many many other horror films I've seen). If she had simply left at the first opportunity well then that would be a pretty pointless film.I'm the type of viewer who can forgive small plot holes or main characters making poor decisions, especially when it comes to horror as so rarely is it done as well as this. I appreciate a movie for what it is - a movie - not real life. If you're a big horror fan like me and don't get overly fixated on the finer details then give this a go, I'm sure you won't regret it.",2022-10-28
"The acting was very good..starts out calm and moves into a mystery of what is going on, different peices are put in -without any spoilers. I will say. Not a ton of gore, so if you dont like gore, this will totally be fine. While there are uncomfortable moments, and definite jump scares that make it entertaining for us horror fans. I gave it a 6 for a reason i cannot say or would be a spoiler. I did see it in the theater , and after watching felt that i could have waited for it on streaming and would have been more satisfied.

"I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I went into this film expecting a slasher film. I was mistaken. I don't understand the bad reviews. But I guess this is not for people who don't appreciate a good build up. It starts slow and also quite misleading...but it's all worth it, because it's utterly disturbing and creepy. Something I won't easily forget.As a horror fan who enjoys anything from mainstream jump scare films, to posession films, to slasher films, I absolutely am grateful to watch a film that is unique and different to the norm. This is just brilliant! I loved it so much. One of my favourite horror films.",2023-01-21
"Without spoiling anything, this movies changes pace dramatically about halfway through. The first half was brilliant. Slow, tense, and had just enough guessing to keep you constantly trying to figure out who/what/when/where and how. That is why the latter portion let's itself down so significantly.Once the premise has been established, the characters laid out, and the plot more or less explained, the thrills seems lacklustre at best. I will credit the acting though. Brilliantly well developed and thoughtful cast that brought the scenes to life.Ultimately, would I recommend this film? Yes. It is good. It has some memorable moments, but definitely wouldn't be a film I would go out of my way to see again. If you're looking for something different within the horror genre, this movie is for you, and I doubt you will be too disappointed.",2022-11-11
"I read a bunch of reviews for Barbarian before watching it. It definitely was not what I was expecting at all. This was not your typical horror movie, or even thriller. It obviously had some elements, but I was left guessing throughout. The beginning of the movie was a little slow. I wish the writer/director could have developed the history of the father a little more. There's just not enough in the film and it does leave plot holes. You are left wondering what happened to the first man, as well. This seems like a very short scene could have been done, but I am not a director so I could be way off.",2022-11-14
"What a waste of time. I'm still trying to figure out who the ""barbarian"" was! The concept had the makings of a good horror movie but they ruined it! No one in their right mind would be measuring square footage for a basement that looked like that and even the most courageous woman would escape and not go back in to save someone she doesnt know! I still can't believe the man who rented the Airbnb didn't understand what a dirty mattress, video camera and a bucket in a hidden room meant! And if that's not enough, 3/4's into the movie they introduce a creepy character who has nothing to do with the plot. I guess he was supposed to be some sort of red herring but no one was fooled.",2022-10-30
I went into this movie blind and it didn't disappoint . The only thing I am disappointed in is that it wasn't as scary as I thought. The movie was just about to get super scary when it switched to Justin long character and it took away the whole horror feel . But don't get me wrong Justin long was hilarious!! His character and the rest of the actors did a amazing job . The writing was awesome and covered all plot holes. The ending was a bit underwhelming but I get it . It felt a bit rushed . It's deff worth another watch for me I just wish it went full hills shave eyes and it didn't . Solid 8.5/10 compared to most movie that have been coming out lately.,2022-09-19
"This movie was pretty boring. Usually, most horror movies would have an opening prologue or such to set the tone and mood of the film, inviting the audience to what they're in for (Scream, It Follows, It). While it's good to break away from formula like The Thing or The Shining did, that doesn't give much of an excuse to make your horror movie boring. Nothing happened for the first half hour, and when something did happen, it was still pretty boring. Its one movie where I felt like I have seen this a million times. The only good part of this movie was Justin Long's character and his subplot. The cinematography and music were one great factor out of this film though.",2022-09-17
"Good characters, good acting, i liked the innovative entity that's out there trying to kill you. But everything is let down by half-baked back story. It could have been a great movie with an emotional ending, but the lack of backstory is a huge huge let down. Tess was shown as a very cautious women but later in the movie, i cant imagine what the hell happened, i mean did her brain drop off somewhere or that she was just stupid all along ?, gawd ! The choices she made were soo dimwitted for the character that was portrayed in the start. 3 star for the cast and acting, Bill was just too perfect, loved his acting.",2022-11-16
"It immediately reminded me of Parasite with what lives downstairs. I would identify it more as a thriller because it has some plausibility. No supernatural horror but a horrific character sequestered in the below-basement. It also had some comic moments that made me laugh from one self-centered character.What I liked about the plot was the three levels to the story with several inter-related characters over time. Tess arrives at her rental to find another renter already there...is he the Barbarian? Then the owner arrives to find both of them held by the occupant from the basement. Is he?. Then we are introduced to the past and the previous occupant who as a predator is responsible for the current status. Then it unfolds. Thrilling but maybe not enough egregious attacks and scares for some. As an add on it is in an African-American area in Detroit and when the police arrive from the call of Tess, who is aBlack woman, they do not take her seriously. If White, would they have? Well written and acted...best thriller-horror I have seen since ""Mother!"".",2022-11-05
"I actually really like this movie. This movie had a really interesting an original story where I wish they would've went into more detail. I was very entertained and I think this movie was really well-made. The acting was amazing. It was definitely spooky, and there were a few jump scares the story hasn't been done before so that was really refreshing. I wish it was a bit longer because it was such an interesting horror film. They could have built up the back story on the house and the original owner a bit more but that would be my only critique. I would definitely recommend if you need a good scare.",2023-04-07
"I have seen almost 500+ horror movies and I would say even Alien movie was 1000 times better than this movie.It was more of a comedy than horror.Not at all horror, just too bad a movie. Maybe the reviewers are related to director or producer but trust me you only watch this if you are sad and want some gigglesWe have seen many such air bnb type movies or thriller and slasher movies but this was mere comedySave money and wait for Prime or Netflix watch.Save money and wait for Prime or Netflix watch.Save money and wait for Prime or Netflix watch.You will believe me when you see it yourself.",2022-09-14
"The Protogonist arrives at an Airbnb only to discover that somebody else is already staying there. Filmm@ker Cregger, working from his own screenplay, delivers a somewhat erratic yet mostly rewarding endeavor that fares best in its tense and periodically riveting opening stretch, as the writer/director kicks the proceedings off with an engrossing first act that seems to be laying the groundwork for a very specific type of thriller - with the promising vibe certainly enhanced by the strong performances and smattering of suspenseful interludes.The story goes in a slow pace but engaging to an extent. Although the picture's overall impact is dampened by Tess, Barbarian progresses into a wildly unpredictable midsection that's enh@nced by several engrossing encounters and a raft of appealingly over-the-top plot developments - with Cregger's stylish visuals certainly proving effective at perpetuating the compulsively watchable atmosphere.Zach Cregger, direction wise is good , if he removes the slow pace ride it would be worth go to flick.",2022-10-11
"This film is incredible. It slowly creeps up on you and its perfect. They had the balls to switch the main character after the second act which feels so crazy but is executed perfectly. The camra work makes this film. It constantly reinvents itself with all of the subversion it pulls. I was hooked and was so invested with what was happening. I'd call it pulp fiction but horror if that makes sense. It turns to what feels like new stories that then relate back to the main plot. I would highly recommend this film, it genuinely made me scares and (for me) that's incredibly tuff as I'm hardly ever scared at horror. I really liked trying to figure out all of the lore. Had so much fun with this, PLEASE WATCH!!!!",2022-10-25
"So I was another viewer who went in blind. All I knew was the main girl (played fabulously by Georgina Campbell- soooo likeable!) arrives at a double booked air bnb and then her new ""roomie"" Bill Skarsgard disappears. Then the ""fun"" begins.It's definitely a movie that can be appreciated by diehard horror fans as well as the more casual horror movie goer. And it's a lot of fun watching with people.That's as far as I got. And I think that's all you need! Go watch it!****Now if you want a few extra details with minor spoilers read ahead:******the film will at times make you feel like it's about to go into familiar horror movie trope territory and then it just throws the rule book out the window. Which makes it unpredictable and very fun.the movie is basically divided into 3 little character backstories showing how they end up at the house- our main girl Tess, our comic relief *ssh*le AJ (played very very well by Justin Long, a lot of laugh out loud moments), and a 3rd shadier character.Bill skarsgard is PERFECTLY cast as the ""stranger"" Keith. Because he usually plays creepo characters, it made me super suspicious of him from the get-go. Which is exactly the point. As is Justin Long who *usually* plays the silly nice guy.finally the movie's title is a play on words and by the end has you questioning who truly is the barbarian?Overall fab movie! Pitfalls were a few insanely stupid decisions by a character at the start, but generally this is forgiven because it's just a blast. Also there's one little scene at the end involving a fall from a height which was a bit on the ridiculous side for me personally.Just minor gripes though!",2022-11-09
"So boring.90mins of my life just gone watching a film which is so dull. Its not scary at all
. It has no story to say and it seems u have to be brainless to find it at lest nice.They did try hard to make u feel its scary or it has some sort of a mystery but that failed.I don't understand why people wanna watch a film that doesn't even look goon on a trailer. Unfortunately i watched with friends who did find the trailer good so they wanted to watch the film. I did warn them from the begging tho. At the end they agreed that it doesn't worth the time.It is so annoying wasting time watching films like this one.",2022-10-29
Starts off predictable and changes completely after the opening and wraps up with perfect song. Every time you hear that song you will remember this film. I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I can usually predict how a film like this will end. It also is a nice little commentary on the decline of big cities in America. Justin Long played his part very well. I also enjoyed the clever title of the film. I have plans to see it again with friends. I highly recommend it and can't wait to see the director and writer other works. Counting down the days to the retail release hopefully with lots of extras and commentary.,2022-10-01
"Barbarian... the plot you can read for yourself so not gonna talk about that! This film had a lot of opportunities to be better. The uncomfortable beginning sets a solid basis for the film. The storyline was good although would have been nice to be explained somehow how the double booking happens. The actors do a solid job allaround. On first viewing camera work seems good,had good intensity in parts where it needed.Theres a good question about finding certain people safe and others a threat. If at least some of the plotholes would have been cleared,this could have been a 7. Maybe explaining the owners story would have helped.",2022-10-27
"The premise is what sucked me in. No way, as a woman, I would share a rental with a strange man. I knew the moment it was revealed the heroine was in Detroit this movie was going to be scary as hell. So many dumb decisions made throughout by several characters, but I was genuinely surprised by the big twist. Parts after the reveal were laughable. Some just made me cringe. If I hadn't been pleased by the ending, I would've probably have given it 4 stars instead of 6. Since there aren't a lot of good movies out at the moment, I'd say this isn't a total waste of your time. Entertaining for the most part.",2022-10-29
"I'm always excited to see a rating of 7.0 or greater on IMDB. This has been the threshold for a decent movie. I'm not sure if I saw the right Barbarian movie, but it was so shallow. I love a bit of Character development..some flashback was good, and necessary; however, way too many unanswered questions. If you make a horror movie and decide not to yell the full story, it had better be really scary. It was not and failed on all levels.The best part of the movie was the gasps from the audience when a certain someone is pushed off a platform stair for self preservation of himself.Don't bother seeing it in the theater.Blah.",2022-09-23
"Well this was an unexpected journey. I found it high in camp and laughs, but low in suspense and scares (despite the anticipation created by a creeptastic set and a delightfully eerie score). I was entertained and found it well done, but i didn't find it terrifying. Many of us left the theater laughing and saying ""wtf did i just watch?"" the more i think about it the more questions i have. Is the killer the barbarian, or does the film point a cryptic finger elsewhere? Is this a brilliant social commentary hidden within a seemingly so-so plot? Could bill skarsgard be any hotter? Is anyone else craving milk?",2022-09-19
I enjoyed this movie to me it was something different it started off slow but it definitely picked up walking down those dark stairs with the flash light was freaky and suspenseful I didn't really get why it was and 18 rated movie though because it wasn't that violent the actor that played the man at the start who was staying in the house he wasn't in it much as he got killed off and I actually thought he was the barbarian so that was a nice plot twist finding out that it was this deformed monster and this monster was freaky I found the movie scary and suspenseful Justin long I found did a good job. But that deformed monster was freaky and scary.,2022-12-15
"Horrifying, this movie is bonkers. My very studious friend and I were indulging in this movie in theater and almost went clinically insane after it was over. So much to think about in so little time it was truly shocking. The mama just wanted some #love. Tess is one of the stupidest people ever written into a movie, why did she go back down into the basement not once not twice but three times? Awfully odd decision. Mama just wants love Fr it's not fair. The ending is aswell very confusing and odd to me it simply doesn't add up. Also how did Tess not die after falling from that building??? Also in the scene where mama squirrel jumped off the building I died laughing.",2022-09-25
"On the plus side: strong acting, effective photography, pretty well paced. A film that explores various consequences of (particularly) male presumption, insensitivity and evil. Very good job of keeping the audience wondering what the gun will serve to accomplish.The lead's a good woman with levels of courage, resourcefulness and decency that inspire admiration while straining credulity. This is a problem because 'Well, she just is' results in a walking-talking symbol instead of a more engaging character.So, on the not-so-hot side: the film's so lacking in realism as to slide right into metaphor, and thus there's a story that soon evolves into a sort of ambivalent lecture on wimpy to grubby to horrid men. There's some very lazy dialog (""What the f---?"" said over and over.)
Question: is there irony in the gender of the actor who plays the appliance wearing monster?",2022-10-20
"So I'm going to go right out and say it: the 'social satire' that Zach Cregger is shooting for here is ridiculous. This movie is ridiculous. With the exception of the first fifteen minutes, the entire film is so egregiously absurd that it's hard for me to even attempt to take it seriously in writing this review. The only thing this movie has going for itself is, maybe, the novelty of the execution, albeit the ideas that inspire the story are certainly not original, and what is original just simply doesn't work. In my opinion, that is.So we are introduced to Jess, an intelligent, cautious, strong woman who, as Bill Skarsgård's character (Keith) astutely observes, seems to have it 'figured out for herself'. Her character, at least within this strange grace-period that briefly exists for the opening fifteen minutes of the movie, is completely believable. Well, except for the fact that she is forced to commit herself to a situation where she accepts the integrity of a stranger, a MALE stranger, that is, a dynamic which the director asserts only exists because she is a woman, as if it's not likely anybody with a brain would be cautious to share a double-booked Airbnb with a stranger in Detroit at 1:00am in the middle of a storm.Then we have Keith, who is obviously meant to diverge audience-expectations with his outward gentleman-like attitude, which ironically is his glaring flaw that Cregger thinks he is brilliantly fostering. ""Let me get your bags"", he says. ""You have a pretty name"", he says. No, he's not being nice, he's being misogynistic! Right? You're not allowed to take a woman's bags inside anymore, right?Oh yeah, that is right. In fact, Tess is the only victim in the story with half a brain, because all the other victims are ignorant men that don't know how hard it is to be a woman in a 2022 horror movie. ""KEITH THERE'S SOMETHING TERRIBLE DOWN THERE WE NEED TO LEAVE!"", says Tess. Nah, don't listen to her, because you're a misogynistic POS right? This is totally a completely accurate, nuanced depiction of what the average man would do in this situation, right? Oh, whoops, he's dead! Didn't see that one coming!Oh now we have AJ, another POS that can't come to terms with the fact that he's also a poopy man that does bad stuff because he's stupid and poopy! Oh what's that, he's super greedy and self-absorbed?? Oh, it's going to end up getting him trapped in the basement with Tess? No, let me guess: Tess is going to make a suggestion again, and he's not going to listen because he's a poopy man. BINGO. Didn't see that one coming!Oh, what's that? Tess escapes and goes to the police? Two MALE police officers? Didn't see that one coming!They don't listen to her despite her clearly being a sane, intelligent, beautiful woman? Of course not, they're poopy men that are self-absorbed! Didn't see that one coming!Oh and this miserable movie is finally coming to a 'conclusion'. Tess comes back to the house! Of course, she has to save the dumb POS that didn't listen to her, because, well ... erm, reasons. She just has to save him, okay??! Just go with it.Wait, she saves him but then the monster Mother isn't really dead? Let's go hide out with the bum that was trying to save your life earlier but you ignored because he was a scary poopy man! Surely one of the nine male characters has some redeemable quality! Right? Wrong! He also 'mansplains' that his hobo abode is completely safe, and, well, the monster claps his cheeks immediately after! Didn't see that one coming!Don't watch this movie. Reading the reviews that praise the commentary on 'womanhood' and 'misogyny' are outright cringey and make me question what kind of ridiculously low standards we have developed for modern horror movies.",2022-10-27
"Don't be fooled by the trailer. This movie sucks. It was a ""bargain"" movie at $5 at my local theater for a prime time evening flick. That should have been warning enough. There was laughter throughout this ""scary"" movie...It was so bad. At the end one woman (not with me) commented the movie was so horrible that she wanted her $5 back.The movie was filled with holes like two people falling off a building, one several dozen feet behind the other, yet the person who fell off second somehow landed on the bottom.It's not even worth watch if it was a freebie on Netflix. Please don't waste your time on this movie.",2022-10-12
"An original concept executed really well. It has a little bit for everyone; some extremely tense scenes, gore and comedy. It enjoyed how it regularly subverted my expectations and flipped gender roles. Perfect for a Friday night Halloween flick!When I saw this film I did not know anything about the plot and I would recommend that you also do the same. The less you know, the better. Essentially, the film weaves together 2 different stories very effectively and does not play out in the manner you would expect.My only criticism is that the film could have given away less in the first sequence. I prefer to never really know what 'it' is or just to be given mere glimpses.",2022-10-31
"So stupid it's good is different from a ""so bad"" it's good movie.The premise of Barbarian is just stupid beyond belief. No way. No how. Not in any version of any multiverse, not even where stupid people have hot dogs for fingers.Throw away the premise of a woman showing up to an Air BnB in the most rundown post-apocalyptic version of Detroit you could possibly imagine and deciding to spend the night with a stranger, and you can enjoy yourself.Put this in suburbia and it would be a much better premise. Without spoiling, most of the terror takes place deep underground anyway.With that, premise aside, the movie is fun. It's suspenseful. The characters are interesting and the secondary premise, while stil unbelievable, is unbelievably fun.",2023-01-27
"I went into this movie blind -- no trailer, no description or reviews, not even seeing a movie poster. This is the best way to experience a film, and this film in particular! If you haven't watched this yet, stop reading reviews and just watch it.For those of you that have watched it or were involved in the production, congratulations! This is fantastic storytelling and a rich experience.The camera work, the lighting, the sets, the music and foley, the acting, the story and vision -- they all work together in perfect timing to make a masterpiece. It perfectly implies the question, ""Who is the barbarian?""I loved the subversion of the actor typecasts, Scarsgard and Long particularly. I was constantly wrenched between empathy vs. Disgust. Each action, every reveal and all the implications expertly rachets up the tension until your stomach is tied in knots and you feel like you might explode or faint. Then, most impressively, the film avoids cheap scares and instead forces each climactic moment to be full minutes that feel like hours of sheer terror and dread, like drowning.I've never been so delightfully manipulated. Thank you!",2022-10-29
"All these reviews are dumb. If you enjoy horror and suspense movies then you'll defiantly enjoy this one!!! Although if that's not your genre then maybe it's not for you. As far as horror suspense movies go this is definitely on the top list. It keeps you engaged, surprised, and the plot twists just kept coming! Perfect mix of suspense, jump scares and humor. Most horror movies you are mad at the characters for being so dumb and annoying, but with this one you root for the characters and actually have time to grow a connection to them! The antagonist is different than you think it will be and the mix of characters makes you think about how the real bad guy is. The ending also does NOT disappoint.",2022-12-07
"*Spoiler Free*I genuinely find myself asking if we've seen the same movie after reading some of these other reviews. In a time where very few horror movies are daring to break the mold and try something different, this one succeeds in just that. Barbarian is an unexpected treat, and absolutely worth watching.I'm not one for spoilers, and this is one of those films where the less you know about it the better. I think the best way to watch any movie is to go into it with no expectations, and just experience it for what it is.Bill Skarsgard, Georgina Campbell and Justin Long all provide top-notch performances in an eerie setting that genuinely disturbed and creeped me out. The script is pretty solid and believable. The character's feel real and I found myself rooting for them. The score is solid and some of the cinematography is also a little 'break off the mold' which I always appreciate. Very very mild interwoven comedy in addition to the ''story within a story'' aspect wraps this film into a truly unique experience that I wish people would just give a chance. It doesn't ever try to be anything that it isn't, and I loved every minute of it.All in all the movie is definitely worth your time. Some of the cuts in the movie unfortunately break the momentum of it's horror ambience, thus the 9/10, however I recommend it very very highly to people who enjoy more unique horror stories.",2022-11-07
"Enjoyable as a silly horror/thriller movie - but lazy writing and directingPros:
-minimal startling jumps that many horrors rely on
Truly creepy when you see footage of the mothergood acting from Justin Longreally cool idea for a horroroverall it's an entertaining 90 minutesCons
lazy horror tropes - stupid cops that don't believe the victim, a girl descending down into a basement she should clearly avoid, 911 operators choosing to not do their job lol all things that do not happen in real liferandom scenes with no tie to the movie. The guy with the nightmare ? Why put that in? In fact why include them double booked at the Airbnb anyway?plot holes - if the mother comes out at night why did she not get the renters the first night?main character had no resolution- they spent so much time on his rape accusations it seemed like they might have him grow or have a change of heart from his experience with the mother - but ... the.man he just almost kills a girl and dies.",2022-10-27
"This movie gets it. Watching Barbarian was surprisingly fun, I always love movies that keeps me guessing and makes me guess wrong. I thought I had it figured out about 4 times and was wrong each time, the story is so well written and the editing is exceptional. I don't know what it is about Justin Long that makes him so perfect for the role he plays but he gives his best performance since Tusk. Georgia Campbell flat out shows off her acting chops and Richard Brake combined sick, creepy and insane flawlessly. Barbarian is one of the rare movies that goes on longer than seems necessary, not because it could but because it should by justifying its eventual ending with an exclamation point.",2022-11-10
"This may be a find for fans of horror films, but it's not particularly noteworthy. The movie was edited in such a way that a few times I had to be sure I was still viewing the same thing. There was a man and a narrative behind it in one of those perplexing sections, but it wasn't further explored or explained. Although it wasn't made obvious to the spectator, one could infer that it was retrospective. It appeared like post production was running on a very tight timeline. Aside from that, the plot is intriguing, unique, and contains some really powerful horror elements. Would I watch it again? No.",2022-11-04
"I worry about people who thought this was a good movie. This movie sucks after the first 20 minutes. There is not a single rational person in this dumpster fire. Why does the woman who wouldn't drink tea go looking for the man she didn't trust in the creepy basement? Why does AJ not care that there is a room with a bloody hand print, bucket and video camera in the basement of his house? His character is dumb as, but he is aware that there is someone staying in the house and then goes in the under ground tunnels. Even with the extra square footage, I'm that neighborhood what is he going to get, an extra $60? I didn't finish. How old are the tunnel people. What happened to the neighborhood? Why doesn't the rental company investigate all the missing people or did the old lady who comes out every night not get them. She took a few weeks off I guess. Justin Long is the worst, obviously he would sign on to make a paycheck regardless of how terrible the movie is. Didn't even finish it. 0 stars. All thumbs down. Probably the worst movie ever made. The only realistic part was that her Jeep patriot would not start after a minor fender bender.",2023-08-11
"The movie has enough tense moments and twists to keep you riveted, but as it progresses the turn of events become increasingly improbable. (That first half though, chef's kiss.)The ending could more or less be solved with the following change:The monster and protagonist do NOT survive the fall, and Justin Long hobbles off to his car and drives away safe.Cut to his rape trial, where he is convinced and sentenced to 10 years.Last shot is him getting locked into a cell with a rough-looking cellmate... So the kicker is that he escaped one prison filled with monsters only to find himself locked in another.",2023-01-03
"I actually enjoyed the first act quite a lot. It was very well done, the suspense was there and as each scene became more and more mysterious it really kept me at the edge of my seat (not literally, I watched this movie on my phone laying on my bed). The scene where bill skarsgard's character was crawling forward in that underground tunnel is nothing short of terrifying.Now don't get me wrong, I did also enjoyed the 2nd and 3rd act. I think it was smart and refreshing (not a lot of movie has done this, the flahsback thingy). However, i do agree with some of the reviews that think the latter half of the movie is rushed. I think a lot of things are left unanswered, like what that creature really is, why is it living down there, why does it have superhuman strength, etc. The movie ended in sort of a cliffhanger, which was probably intentional but very annoying for the audience.Hoping there'd be a sequel to this movie.",2022-12-30
"Wow this film was amazing. Went to see it on opening night in UK cinemas and have already booked tickets to see it again. A great story line, it's not at all what I expected it to be and it shocked me in a good way! Bill and Georgina were utterly amazing, great acting from them both (To be expected).The story / writing itself was brilliant. There was a great mix of horror / funny parts. It's definitely not your cheesy run of the mill horror, it had me at stages hiding behind my friends arm which I can say Iv never visibly been scared at a cinema until now!I recommend everyone gives this film a go as I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't like it.I hope there's a lost more movies like these coming from these particular writers / directors and even the actors as i thought they were great!P.",2022-10-29
"I know I enjoyed a movie if it leaves me thinking about it hours and days after it ended. That already happens in the end of Act 1 when there was still an hour left and I had no idea what direction the movie was taking. It gives the audience a few surprises -it plays with people's expectations of horror films and people- and you just need to let go and entertain these ideas, which to me totally pay off.Along the ride, the tension, direction, camera work and acting are excellent. We're introduced to a not-so-smart female lead and a couple of really afwul male characters (in case you're wondering who the barbarian is) and there are a couple of dialogues that are triggering if you've ever been gaslighted, manipulated or downright abused -so consider yourself warned. And btw Justin Long's character is the absolute worst but he's great at it.The film did remind me of Red State by Kevin Smith in the sense that it seems like many stories in one, but here I think the director doesn't experiment with the storylines so the end result is believable for a horror movie.",2022-11-14
"Let me start off by saying, this is one of the best films of the year. My manager at work actually recommended it to me. I'd never heard of it but as soon as I put it on, I was hooked.It's a brilliant film, well acted and the suspense is some of the best I've seen for ages in a film.If you rated this below 7/10, then you need to watch more films.It was different and the whole Air B&B idea was good, the secret room and the whole plot was good. I mean some but we're far fetched but that's the idea of a film. Justin Long's character was creepier than the women lol.So basically is amazing and definitely go and see it!",2022-11-03
"This film had me on the edge of my seat through the first act. A suspicious man or trustworthy? I loved that I kept questioning if I should trust him or not. The suspense was fantastic!This film also had jump scares that actually made me jump!! I enjoyed that so much because it's rare for me.The second act gives you time to breathe.Overall great acting, scary, gross, suspenseful. The previews for this were so vague and I wasn't sure what it was about and then was actually surprised at what it was. I really like that, and I think more films need to have vague previews.I thought the acting was great, the story was something I haven't seen but I wish there was more of the backstory. I felt they could have added more and taken out the intro to Justin long's character. I like a little more gore but the gore they did have was good.Overall, it was a great film. I enjoyed being scared for once.",2022-09-19
"I saw an article today in which Zach Cregger stated that he wanted to make something which he's never seen before.I'm not totally sure this is wholey original. But its just original enough to not be the same old thing. It's an interesting story, with some tense momments, but there are also a couple of ""really?"" momments which kinda took me out of the movie just because they were things that just wouldn't happen in the real world.I'm glad I didnt watch a trailer, and went in blind, as horror movies are always better the less you know about them going in. I feel like watching a trailer would have spoiled the suprises for me, as they usually do. I Gave this a 6 out of 10, because it was a fun movie, don't take it too seriously.",2022-10-31
"I'm so glad I went into this film blind. I knew nothing about it except a few names on the cast list, and that saved me from the burden of expectation. Without spoiling anything, I'll just say that the movie starts with a somewhat familiar introduction - tense, eerie, filled with anticipation - and then evolves in totally unexpected ways. It doesn't feel like the writer/director was deliberately misleading the audience, but by employing some horror tropes while subverting expectations of where that will lead, he has the viewer in the palm of his hand as any guesswork would be fruitless. That's masterful storytelling. There is a flashback sequence where the camera work is distinctly different from the rest of the film in away that is effective at building anxiety (so much better than your typical sepia filtered flashback scenes). I was along for the ride and was thrilled to see the tonally disparate elements of the film all come together at the end. Favorite release of 2022, by far.",2022-11-28
"Half the fun of this horror film is not knowing much about it or where it's going to take you, so I'll keep it vague. Well crafted, shot, and edited, it's been weeks since I saw this movie, but it keeps popping into my head. If you go back after the movie is over and start scraping for what some might consider plot holes, sure you can think up a few, but honestly.... I just didn't care because I had so much fun watching it. Does it deserve a 9/10 in the context of ""greatest horror movies ever""? Probably not, but a 9/10 in terms of it satisfying what I think encompasses a great horror movie. Definitely worth a watch if you like a scare, but do yourself a favor and don't watch any trailers. If you're reading this review, you're probably already doing too much digging.",2022-11-15
"Film begins interesting, maybe best kinda slow build since ""The Strangers"" but somehow everybody wakes up and leaves the house that you are not suppose to be able to leave! The film makers left a lot of things unanswered and instead choose to throw in a Hollywood (excuse my language) A-hole, that deserved much worse than what happened to him...The first part of this film, was interesting & eerie; made you anticipate what was going to happen... then everyone gets out of the house & the film goes to Hollywood and becomes BASIC, downhill from there.. 10 star For the first part/ 0 star For the last = 5 starFilm.",2022-11-06
"I went into this movie without any idea what it was about. Do not watch the trailer before watching the movie. I would definitely go into it blind sighted with no prior knowledge of the movie. So many plot twists and I would think one thing about the film, and the exact opposite would happen to what I was thinking. Barbarian made me think through some of the scenes as to what was actually happening. So many crazy plot twists I will NEVER stop talking about them. I saw this movie a year after it came out into theaters so I watched it at home, but it was still amazing, watching it in theater or not. Don't miss out on this movie.",2023-08-06
"First time reviewing something on this but I couldn't resist after watching the film.After a string of lacklustre horror pfilms recently, I was beyond hyped for Barbarian. The trailer didn't give much away, especially the fact that one of my favourite actors is in this film.Justin Long comes into play quite surprisingly in this film and it's done as a perfect pallet cleanser. The humour in his scenes is executed perfectly and balances so well with the underlying tension we as an audience experienced so far.Immediately from the opening frame I knew this would be a good horror. The vibe and atmosphere all get off to a great start and the film never lets up. It switches things up constantly enough that you're never bored.The script in my opinion is one of the best for horror. There is no fat on this story. We are only given crumbs of information throughout, it's up to us to figure out exactly what is happening here and I loved it.From start to finish this was a great cinema experience and I will be highly recommending this to all of my friends as the best horror film of 2022.",2022-11-17
"This was actually a very entertaining movie. It is well written for a horror film, has good pacing and is creepy throughout. I'm subtracting two points for some logical errors and the message, which is obviously ridiculous. Once again, all men are trash and all women are wonderful. Even behind the most ugly and disturbing monster of a women is a man who made her the way she is. Also, being persistent is equated with r*pe, which I find is a very wrong and dangerous portrayal. I felt so bad for Justin Long's character. Him being so selfish at the end also didn't fit in the slightest either. The most absurd scene is the one with the cops, that was just face-palm stupid and would never happen in real life. All this ideologal cheese didn't detract too much from the film though, the good parts still outweigh the bad. I would recommend it to all fans of horror movies, just ignore the silly attempt at social criticism.",2023-04-28
"Keeps you on your toes most of the movie whilst also having an element of normality to the story line with everyday things happening and backstories to most of the characters. The sad element is that backstory behind the monster (The Mother). Now you don't exactly get a direct backstory but there's pieces of the puzzle you can put together to assume she had a very traumatic life- causing her to become what she is. All she wanted was to be a mother. Needed more backstory for the mother in my opinion- or perhaps the uncertainty adds to the suspense.Maybe a sequel explaining more would be good- it just a prequel in itself. Over all it was a very moving piece, wouldn't mind watching that again.",2023-01-28
"Soooo I DO NOT get scared easily, but this movie actually made me feel kinda scared. It's pretty scary...the quality of the movie tho???? The first half was SOOOOOO good!!! I LOVED the first half! It was so good and was building up to so much! The second half was just so confusing for like 20 mins then it made sense and then it was just bad! It had too much just WEIRD stuff. It was so good and legitimately believable and realistic. And then it got so weird and I was like ""HUHHHH! "" and I am so mad at the casting director for casting Bill Skarsgård and then killing him!!!! I was HEARTBROKEN. It's okay tho. At least he wasn't a murderer. But still that man is so fine. To fine to have such a short and devastating death. It was a good realistic scary movie and then it got to some hereditary type stuff. Like whattttttt. Even weirder and more disturbing than hereditary. I loved it at the beginning and then it got bad and weird. Honestly tho, I think you should give it a watch and be prepared for some weird stuff. Love you. Safe watching (I am traumatized)",2023-03-04
This movie was scary. Like omg i saw so many people jump out of their seats due to the intense jumpscares. The movie has a perfect way of making everything so unsettling which i loved. And the ''mother'' was so disturbing and creepy espeically in the basement scenes. The main character was great and everyone else and the chase scenes were intense. This movie will make you keep guessing what is going. I would of never guessed this was the plot. I would rate this higher but some scenes kinda threw me off. I recommend this film since its really good and scary and will keep you guessing. And the kill scenes were gory!,2022-10-26
"This film starts off with a very strong atmosphere and I expected something completely different from what we find out later in the story. No spoilers but, I really liked that about halfway through the film there was a flashback where we were given some explanation as to how this creature was born down there! I liked that the camera switched to 4:3 and they didn't tell us what year it was, but we could only get some clues from the car radio. It was quite an awesome flashback despite the bright colours and the daytime scenes :)About the film, the actress Georgina Campbell and Bill Skarsgard are brilliant, great casting really! Georgina Campbell is so good in the role that it's genius. Right up to the point where she gets out of the house!Let the mistakes come!Because afterwards, when he explains to the police what happened to him, she is too calm (when the police officer tells her to take her hands off the car). I simply did not understand how she could be so traumatized and then calmly show the police the situation. The other is that the monster that chases him when he climbs out of the basement window of the house is not blinded by the sunlight ? After all, if you spend a lot of time in the dark your eyes can't stand the light! Especially not in broad daylight! Other mistakes are that when they fall into the pit while escaping they are upside down in the pit when you can see them ! Also a huge mistake is that when the monster pulls the guy out because he won't take the milk, he puts him back in the same place (same room) that you can see when Georgina Campbell climbs out :) And it popped up right away!!!! And I only saw the movie once ! It is a big mistake to have two directions leading to the same place !!! XD Probably because it was shot in an internal studio but still a huge mistake!!! Because why climb up if the corridor downstairs leads to the same place? XD How did nobody notice that during the production? Obviously it was made with little money but still.Towards the end the old man in the bed shouldn't have been there as it was completely unnecessary and it would have been better if he was a kind of monster of course because of his age it wasn't possible to make him so strong. And about the videos, how much better would it have been if one of the characters had started to play the camera footage in the room in the beginning? But say we only hear sounds but the camera doesn't show us what's on the video? It would have been good for suspense and it wouldn't have cost anything extra in production costs because then in a dialogue the character would have explained to Bill Skarsgard upstairs that look I found a room and on the video etc...
Also if the monster had been blind that would have been good!!! Because then they could have tricked him etc...Also, who made the videos of the women being raped or kidnapped?Obviously the dude we see in the flashback, but then who brought him the food etc... that monster can't just jump down to Walmart. So there should have been a scene where the food disappears from the fridge the next day or something, where the character goes shopping after the interview and takes it home and disappears the next day, or she moves into the Airbnb with food by default! There are a lot of gaps in the movie and the fact that the monster survives a car and a 30m fall at the end is just a joke. Just because it's been down in the basement for decades and a monster? It still has a spine and joints. And how can he rip a man's skull apart at the end?But what shouldn't have been in there at all is the idiotic breastfeeding scene where the dude wants to get sucked off by the monster in front of the TV.The positives:I already mentioned the acting. The atmosphere was also terrific thanks to the brilliant cinematographer!!! The guy deserves a raise! And so do the designers of the sets. It's a pity that the script is a bit of a mess in a few places, but considering that this is the director's first film, it's forgivable. The idea is great as well as the visuals and the cast, unfortunately it's the second half of the story that is full of mistakes and stupid scenes that are not needed.I love horror movies and since I was a kid I've seen a lot of movies even low budget B movies etc. I've even done extras in movies and series like DUNE part 2 , The Fear Index, etc..and where else in this movie called LEE. Over there I even met one of the actors Alexander Skarsgård who is supposedly the brother of Bill Skarsgård. Anyway, I follow both of their work and hope to see more horror films like this in the future. If you read this, I hope the filmmakers will take some of my advice.",2022-11-08
"Although I have not written many reviews, I am really tempted to review this one. The reason is that I am surprised how this movie has gotten so high grades. Those grades were the reason I was motivated to watch it.It is not a bad horror movie, but not a good either. If one wants to watch that movie, I see it like selecting between dining at a fast food store or a restaurant. If you are really hungry and there is no restaurant near you, a fast food store is not a bad choice. The stomach gets full. But if you want taste, a restaurant is the way to go: this movie is like a fast food store, for a fan of horror genre.",2022-11-08
"I've heard a lot of mixed opinions before watching this - either loving it or hating it. Went in with an open mind and was pleasantly surprised.It kinda remind me of Cabin in the Woods. First time watching it I thought the first half was good and the second half was bonkers. Leaving me with the feeling of 'wtf did I just watch'. I kinda felt the same watching Babarian. But the second time watching it, I actually really really liked it. Not that i didn't the first time. It has a lot of great elements and the story is interesting. Unless you hate it I would recommend watching it a second time.The acting was great! It's not very scary, but definitely worth a watch.",2023-01-12
I have no understanding of the negative reviews given here - this movie is phenomenal.It is 2022's Get Out.The cinematography and musical score is next level perfection with little nods here and there to pop culture.The story is fantastic. You are kept on your toes throughout and you NEED to go into this without looking into the plot whatsoever.There's not much I could critique about this film and if you appreciate cinematography and the horror genre then you should not be disappointed.10/10 easily the best film I've seen in 2022. Would recommend to anyone who's into this genre.It would have been perfection in a cinema.,2022-10-29
"Barbarian was one of those movies I didnt except much but it surely delivered more than that. In tons of horror movies today and their clicheis, Barbarian manages to rise with simple but somewhat exciting storyline merged with great suspension and jumpscares. Bill Skarsgård once again proves he is bulit for these type of movies. His solo persona and presence on the screen makes you think what shady business is hidden behind his character but I am not gonna go into spoilers. Movie has decent pacing although, there are parts of it which felt dragged a bit. The only real thing i didnt like about it is the ending which felt anti climatic for me, but hey who I am to judge? We all have different taste. Nevertheless, this is a must watch for horror movie fans, grab soda and some popcorns, sit back, you wont regret it !",2023-04-24
"I went into this movie completely blank and purposely avoided all the spoilers. So I won't be giving any as well. But it is one of the best horrors I've seen in a long time. Super suspenseful and great story telling. I was on the edge of my seat for the entire time.The director made the movie in such a way that sort of every ""chapter"" felt different. And doing it this way somehow made it innovative. There has been released a lot of great horrors this year and last year. But from. The suspense aspect this one is right on top. And I wish that directors who make movies like this get a bigger stage.",2022-11-05
Awesome movie! Kind of hills have eyes like but definitely very good and keeps you at the edge of your seat. It's long just enough and shows good vs evil sort of thing.

"I'm shocked by so many people who are negging on this movie. IDK, did they expect Gone With The Wind or something? The movie was genuinely scary and extremely suspenseful. It was very original IMO and the characters were pretty engaging. The monster was fantastic, IMO. Pretty much the most original and memorable monster I can think of in the past 20 years.Certain scenes in this movie are etched into my memory because they were so horrific...I'm talking about the feeding scene.I also had no problem with the fact that the movie changes direction towards the end moving from scary and suspenseful to full on Tarantino-style comic book horror. The last 10 minutes of the movie were extremely good, IMO.Again, it seems like too many of the reviews here are overly critical of what is essentially a comic book/80's style horror flick with some very original content that works very well.I recommend this movie to anyone who isn't a movie snob and wants to have some fun.",2023-05-09

"My initial rating was 8/10, but I've done some thinking.In my eyes the execution was ok, it wasn't mind-blowing, though definitely not bad. I had absolutely no expectations going into this and to say that the plot wasn't what I thought in the beginning, would be an understatement. Usually I'm a big fan of plot twists, although this one just didn't SHOCK (it was unexpected, sure, but in a way that's just too grotesque to imagine at first). It's like yeah, I guess this is where this movie is going now.What did shock me was the 4 acts which made up the whole piece. I had a feeling that the plot was progressing a little too fast for the length of the movie, so that was a bullet dodged.Another thing I appreciate is the lack of jumpscare-overload (especially because I've also just watched ""smile"" which was made up of just jump scares, compared to Barbarian)It surely is an interesting one, the ending left me almost touched, but it just lacked the shock value I need from a good plot-twisty-horror. Hence the 7/10. One of the better ones I've seen this year though.",2022-12-20
"Let me start of by saying... this film really was not what I expected! The first 45 minutes or so started of like any other horror movie and I was almost certain I knew where it was going, however this was proved wrong and this is what I loved the most... it kept me guessing throughout and it wasn't predictable.The movie portrays itself with the perspectives of three different individuals that all link to the same property. At first I wasn't sure where the story was going but eventually everything made sense and it all tied in perfectly with each other!Having Justin Long play AJ Gilbride was a good shout for this movie as this added a hint of dark humour and I couldn't help but laugh during some of his scenes.Overall, a very good horror movie!",2023-01-19
"The movie started out decent, the opening scene was generic, and leaned on cliches in order to allow the audience to form a completely wrong idea of what is actually happening. It seemed original enough, until the middle. The middle perhaps, was the worst part, with the supporting character rolling in an distratcing us from what's going on by trying to make him a symbol for a male manipulator. This wasn't a horrible plot device, as it makes for a mediocre ending and matches the overall theme behind the movie, but it makes the plot feel rushed. The only way we as the audience even truly realize what is going on is when we are given a crumb of context through a flashback, and this was also poorly rushed. It's not until a minor character outright has to explain to us what is going on for the movie to come together, and by then the movie was almost over, and the climax needed to happen so they ended it by using cheap camp tactics.The only redeeming quality of this movie is the cinematography and the acting. The shots through the movie were original and unique, and the actors did a great job of making you feel their anxiety along with them.",2022-11-01
"This is the best thriller i've seen since ""dont breath"" i had plan on seeing something else but it had a lot of good reviews so i took a chance I didnt know what to expect it was better, great acting great suspense and i will not give away any spoilers but it was like 3 stories in one !! They give you the end, middle then the beginning, it starts off a little slow but hang in there it does get better thought i had it all figured out but boy was I wrong, one spoiler alert its ten times better then people under the stairs ..now im afraid to rent an airbn im scheduled for a trip to new orleans lol.",2022-09-19
"Well ,as a lover of horror since 79' this really started off great. Some great scenes from a lonely traveler looking for a place to stay after an Airbnb goes awry.Then it descends into a shlock of 'wrong turn' meets 'hills have eyes' meets 'creep' 90's English underground horror film, that was better.It's a lot of suspense but leaves little to the imagination after the first 40 minutes. It could have been 30 minutes less. It's shame as the start was brilliant and was hoping it was going into a disturbing scenario.It's a case of suspense at the start meets a poor man's weirdo's left behind in a town that died because of them.Very average.",2023-10-29
"I was kind of expecting this movie to be way more scary. At some parts it was slightly scary, but not as much as I wanted it to, given the fact that the producers of The Conjuring, The Ring and IT made it. It may be seen as scary for some people, but for me it just wasn't it in the scary way. Despite being slightly disappointed because of how little scary it was, it was definitely well-made. The actors were great at their characters and did not disappoint in that way. Definitely a movie that is worth watching, but if you're looking for something really scary, this is not it. There exists better horror movies.",2023-01-08
"I remember seeing the trailer on Tiktok and was highly excited to see it cause I'm a pretty decent fan of Bill Skarsgård, especially after It, and I thought this movie would be a more interesting watch than it actually wasNow, for some good points.-I did get scared multiple times, and I think the villain we end up seeing was incredibly frightening.-Bill Skarsgård was very charming and was quite suspicious, but it added to his charm.-Georgina Campbell was also quite charming, though her paranoia was a more interesting take that was a bit irritating.-And Justin Long was a very interesting man who definitely did well as someone who was highly frustrated due to accusations and I've always loved his performances.-Even the minor characters added some good insight and worked well with the movie's flow.-I also thought the movie, though it was a bit slow, it never dragged on or felt like it was too long for what it was going for.Despite these good aspects, it did not make up for the disappointment I felt after watching this movie. I just could not get into it and it definitely was not what I was expecting it to be.To be honest, I was fully expecting something paranormal or something out of this world rather than this weird being that turned out to be human but just changed over time. To me, this seemed very much like a cop-out and just fell short of its good ideas.Now, if you like/love this movie, I'm very happy that you found enjoyment where I couldn't; and in all honesty, my opinions are better than my dad (who I went to see this with) and he's putting it in his top 3 most hated movies he's ever seen.So yeah, I did not enjoy this movie, but it's not the worst either.",2022-09-28
"Let me start out by saying that the first twenty minutes of the film are great. The cinematography and sound design come together to create a creepy and uncomfortable first act which has the viewer wanting more. However, this all falls apart when the antagonist is revealed and the movie steadily declines on the way to an abrupt and unsatisfying conclusion. The film also falls apart with its countless plot holes. It establishes scenarios and rules for its characters that would make the antagonists actions nearly impossible to have happened, especially for a film taking place in modern day. If you've seen the movie consider this:What were the father and daughter doing for food? The father is bedridden and couldn't even reach for a bottle of water. Are we to believe they are cannibals who ate the other family members or strangers? There is no evidence or even hints of that through the film.The homeless man mentions that she comes out at night. Ok, maybe she gathers food or kidnaps people? But wait...If the door to the basement locks from outside, as we see multiple times as the protagonists get locked in, how did she get out at night? This one fact immediately makes the entire movie implausible. She can't use keys either or wouldn't be able to input the code for the lockbox so how does she get in and out?What does she do with the victims? We do not see a single body or human remains in the basement throughout the movie. What did she do with Keith or the other mothers/daughters?How was the house being listed on multiple Airbnb services without the owners or property managers knowledge? They mention it was not rented out in over a month and yet two people rented it simultaneously? Are we to believe the father made these listings from his underground hiding place to lure victims? Did he have accomplices working for him?Are we to believe that generations of inbreeding create super humans? She literally ripped a man's arm off and tore another's head in halfI could go on and on. The film falls apart if you use any rational thinking. The comedy is alright at times and ridiculous at others. Do yourself a favour and stop watching after the first 20 minutes if you want to save yourself the disappointment.",2022-09-16
"This movie is now something that makes absolute Sense. It's weird that it cuts into 2 parts, but keeping that in mind, it's a weird fun ride that can sometimes happen in movies such as this. It was giving me major People Under the Stairs vibes at first but then really proved to be something new and refreshing. Does it have a few plot holes? Yeah. But more importantly does it bring something new and stimulating to the mind? I think it does. It was edge of your seat and thought provoking. Everytime I thought ( oh well theyre gonna do this) they half the time didn't. For me, it's gonna be a yearly October month movie 🍿",2022-11-13
"The beginning of the film is good and it is the only thing good about it, as if they changed the writer right after that.The progress of the story is boring, the scenes were more disgusting than scary, it is classified as horror but it is not horror.Some scenes are not necessary and they had gone to far, didn't film others as if they were in a hurry.The back story is ""meh"", not rich, and didnt add much to the film, it might been done better.In the end, the film is a complete waste of time, was felt as unfinished, I wouldn't watch it againIf you are looking for an horror movie find something else.",2023-05-05
"Not for me, but I can see the appeal. Not a bad movie. Some really good kills. But I. I honestly don't know.1. I NEVER would have gone into the house that a man I didn't know was in there.2. I NEVER would have spent the night with him in the house
3. I would not have gone looking for him when he went down there
So all that was way to far fetched for me. Then the incest baby momma appeared and all that followed was pretty good twist. And when you realize she just wanted a baby to love it was quite sad. All in all very disturbing, but I can see why people like it. Again, I just don't think it was for me.",2022-10-28
"I feel like this was the studio's attempt to trick us into watching a Justin Long movie.I wanted so much to like Barbarian. The trailer was terrifying, but I have to say that I was disappointed. Everything you see in the trailer is the first half of the movie, which is legitimately scary. Georgina Campbell and Bill Skarsgard did a fantastic job. They built up a lot of great, Hitchcockian suspense, and then halfway through Zach Cregger just threw the entire plot away and started over with a Justin Long comedy. I have no interest in a Justin Long comedy.This really felt like two different movies to me, and I wish they would have stuck with the first plot line. The second half of the movie replaces suspense with gross-outs, the plot ceases to be believable to the point of stupidity (you can't ignore the laws of physics, dummies), and at the end you realize that the whole setup for the movie served absolutely no purpose but to be a fake-out. Surprise! You just paid to see a Justin Long movie.",2022-09-12
"I love in the beginning of this movie where there's tension and suspiciousness between Tess and Keith. When the audience put their suspiciousness on Keith. And the whole thing when Tess found the basement. They build up perfectly. But a lot of things remain unanswered. Why did the Mother wake up at night to come to Tess room and do nothing at the first time? Why do the Mother just bite Keith and not imprisoned him like she did to AJ, and why Keith insist to go back instead of running away with Tess? Why Andre lives there when he know about these things? And lastly what is that about the airbnb lessor why they don't aware of these things? Like a lot of things doesn't added up. But overall it is very enyoable, thrilling, and well directed movie.",2022-10-28
"Like you read it in the title, I'll say it again, best movie of 2022 and in my personal opinion maybe one of my favourites.This movie gives you a one in a lifetime experience. I watched it with my partner and I was clenching their arm the whole time. Now, I'm a big horror movie fan, but I don't easily get scared.This movie will have you on edge the whole time. You never really know what's going on even when you think you do. I spent hours searching online for a movie like this one and I wish I could watch it all over again.Spoil-free explanation:This story revolves around a girl who moves in to an Airbnb as you see in the trailer and things take an unexpected turn. I don't want to spoil so I won't tell you the details but I can tell you, you would've never guessed.",2022-09-12
"I went watching the movie not really knowing anything about it or seeing a trailer. My girlfriend suggested we watch it and these days horror movies tend to be pretty wack so I had low expectations.I was pleasantly surprised with this movie though. It has a combination of realistic possibilities mixed with fantasy. I actually enjoyed how he story came together and how the flashbacks to provide more back story were presented.It keeps you guessing the entire time and you wonder who the bad guy is that entire time. Right when it seems you've hit the climax it seems to reset leaving you confused but still very much invested.I think the combo of story telling, demented acts that you know happen in real life mixed with a bit of fantasy make this a worthwhile horror to watch. It won't be an 8 or 9 out of ten but absolutely worth the watch and completely enjoyable.",2022-10-31
"Watching this movie will definitely surprise you because it leads you on the wrong track. ""Barbarian"" is unpredictable and horrifying in almost every sequence !What I really liked was the camera work: The movie manages to create an eerie atmosphere just by showing a cup of tea or a room in the house. One thing I would criticize is, that the ending does not provide any further explanations. Also, some scenes are pretty disgusting to look at but are essential for the plot.Moreover, the score makes you shiver and fits in every scene by supporting the tense throughout the movie.I watched the trailer after I watched the movie and I have to say it does not reveal anything which is important for the whole plot. So if you are a horror fan looking for a decent horror movie, ""Barbarian"" will not dissapoint you !",2022-11-14
"The character, plot build, acting and special effects were great. It was fairly scary, although I thought it would be more scary in the second half and the end based on how well they built up the story. They could have gone a bit beeper into the family story. There was a bit of the classic/dumb ""of course she's going to go in the basement by herself"" vibe, but the build was good enough to overlook it. Overall it was good and kinda scary, with the potential to be on the level of Get Out. If you are claustrophobic, this will probably be even scarier. Most scary movies are absolute trash so I appreciated this and recommend it!",2022-11-19
"Absolutely brilliant horror/thriller.Keeps you on the edge of your seat from start till finish.Very time you think you know what's going to happen you very quickly realise that actually no, you don't have a clue haha.The acting from all involved is above average for this genre, and there's some big well known names and faces in this. The make up is great also.Some absolutely horrific jump scares which made this 41yr old 18stone man soul his undergarments.

"I usually don't watch horror films in theaters. I'm very selective about which horror, thriller movies I watch in theaters (""The Conjuring"", ""Susperia"", ""It"" are the few I have seen in theaters). ""Barbarian"" is something else. I'll try to keep this spoiler-free. The relatable story of two strangers who end up getting double-booked at a house rental sets up the characters really well. The movie keeps your attention, second-guessing things along the way. When we finally enter the second act, that's when we enter the horror/thriller aspects of the film. Justin Long's character was a very interesting layer to add to the film.The movie is a good mix of horror, thriller & jest. At moments when you think things couldn't get worse, they do. And when characters go through survival mode, anything goes (I'll leave it at that!). I'm intrigued by the backstory of the neighborhood & Frank (the previous owner in the 1980s), which I hope the filmmakers decide to visit in a sequel or series.I appreciate the film not being a gore fest. Just a straightforward story with horror elements.",2022-09-13

Definitely the best horror movie since IT 2. So glad I saw this as a matinee in a theater and you could hear a pin drop. This is chock full of surprises, but also has great character development that really makes it a burn at just the right pace. It is unlike any film I have seen recently and I love horror movies. The gory scenes are done so perfectly it leaves you wanting more. See this movie you won't regret it it has something for all horror fans.",2022-09-21
"Enjoyed most of it, likable characters, neat abrupt switches in the story, excellent camera work and mood setting, but ultimately the payoff just wasn't there, and the villain(s) - while initially pretty scary - were not particularly intriguing.As others have said, there are plenty ""wtf are you thinking"" moments that are not believable (think opening of ""Scary Movie"" where Carmen Electra picks up a banana rather than a gun).Most of the movie was quite suspenseful and kept me interested and wanting to know what would happen, but I was not ultimately satisfied with the way things turned out.The story was setup to be absolutely terrifying, but it never reached its initial potential.Still, pretty neat and entertaining!",2022-12-23
The movies starts of strange and continues to progress in an intriguing manner. The plot is average development is slow for good reason and that holds your attention earlier on in the movie.The questions the movie makes you ask yourself do get answered maybe not in how you would ever expect.The horror element is derived from violence and holds little substance but at times it does give you that feeling of uneasiness.Acting was good maybe average but hey I watched the whole movie and during the credits I was expecting some form of Easter egg but sadly not unfortunately.Watch this movie but don't expect anything to special it's not a one to watch it's a watch once!,2022-12-06
"Firstly, the trailer was so much scarier than the entire movie. All the best scenes from the movie was put in the trailer. It starts of really good but when we see the barbarian it went down hill. I believe they could have done it so much better. It was just so confusing. It started off as a paranormal movie but ended as a monster/killing movie. The whole movie was hyped because of the trailer but I believe they could not finish the movie in a good way, so they ended it exactly how other horror movies as finished. They also blamed the whole barbarian theme on inbreeding which does not make any sense at all because it's simply not true. It a okay movie but it does not deserve the hype it have gotten.",2023-10-29
"Barbarian is actually a really solid horror film. The plot is linear, and refreshingly unpredictable. It was absolutely terrifying and the fact that they were able to create that amount of tension and unease throughout nearly the entire film, without resorting to cheap jump-scares or an excessive amount of gore, easily makes this one of the best horror movies that has been released in a long time. I can easily see this become a modern classic. It's full of twists and turns and a very effective direction that will keep most viewers holding their breath all the way to the end. It's Alsop likely to stay in your head long after the credits.",2022-11-17
"Horror movies can be enjoyed in several ways, from the scream, the gore, and the psychological pressure. For years, unexpected twists and gimmicky soundtracks have been a trend in horror, but Barbarian is not guilty of that. From an original premise, realistic and with a powerful denunciation of the impoverishment of the city, Detroit could be a wonderful short horror film, and then opens a subplot that rides a delicate line between building and erasing. My feeling after watching the film is good, shot very A24 style but leaves me with the feeling that with that wonderful opening, something more could have been done. There are ingredients in the script that, in my opinion, would have made the terror of how we let our cities die to shine much brighter because if there is something to be afraid of right now, it is the price of housing.",2023-01-09
"I saw a trailer for this on TikTok the same day I saw it. It was one of those finds that came out of nowhere. I didn't really know what to expect when I purchased my tickets but the trailer looked really scary. In addition, they had a clip of the audiences reaction and that was what sold it for me.The movie started off very eerie. There was a red herring in there that made the twist of the movie surprisingly good. There were elements of comedy that altogether made this movie worthwhile. Bill Skarsgard, Georgina Campbell, and Justin Long gave great performances in this. I couldn't believe how good this was. Probably the best horror movie of 2022 in my opinion.",2022-10-29
"I can't fathom why this movie was titled ""Barbarian."" It evokes something far different than what it is.I heard Joseph Shepherd positively reference this movie on his podcast ""Sissy That Talk Show"" and gave it a try. I'm glad I did. I honestly had not heard of this film and easily would have missed it, based on that terribly apt title, but so glad I found it.The trailer was wonderfully misleading. I thought the movie was about one horror genre, but then surprisingly shifted to another.The less you know about this film the better.But my god that title is so incredibly wrong for this film...",2023-02-03
"First part of the movie was tense. You don't know which way it is going and then it culminates in a terrifying scene in a tunnel under the house. And then.... It switches to a scene with Justin Long's character that actually made me pause the movie to see if there was a glitch and somehow got switched to a different movie. His character is so unlikable that it tarnishes the rest of the movie. Also some ridiculous plot details. How exactly does someone jump off a tower after you but end up underneath you - and live. And if Justin Long's character owned the house and he was oblivious to it being rented as an Air BNB, who was renting it out? Had great potential and worth a look on a slow evening but be prepared to ultimately be disappointed.",2022-11-15
"I'll always back Justin Long, that dude is charismatic and brings some serious comedic chops to his characters whilst still keeping the tone of the scene uneasy and thematic for his films.This film is a fun ride from start to finish, it will make you cover your eyes, drop your jaw, lean forward to the edge of your seat and also laugh (just a little).The premise is new, although I guess you could find elements in other films of similarity, it's characters are relatable, and unlike many horrors, make decisions that seem logical and pretty on par with what I would do.Multiple backstories converge on one house and its grim secret, allowing for a well developed story.2022 delivers with this banger and I would definitely recommend you get involved ASAP.",2023-02-21
"I really enjoyed the immersion and the way the narrative is told. The construction of the film resembles an iceberg, initially showing only the tip, which is at sea level, and then sinks down showing the entire large body of ice below the water. There was a bit of confusion in a certain transition of the narrative but nothing difficult to understand.It's a good horror movie, without big scares that could give you a heart attack but enough to leave you watching some scenes between the fingers of your hand while your face is covered.I recommend it for those who are with friends on a pizza night and for couples who like to venture out and be scared together. (for those who like to venture into horror alone too :)",2023-01-03
"Unfortunately I found out about this film through a 'top ten movie twists' list so knew where it was going. Really wish I hadn't! By the time you finish it feels like the 'double booked air b and b in a very rough area of Detroit, which one's going to turn out to be crazy' part was from a movie you'd watched before this one. Well acted throughout. Skarsgård is excellent and the other 2 main characters are also good. Mother is one of the best 'monster' characters to come along in a while, horrible and creepy and, unlike a lot of these type of films, isn't ruined when you actually get a good look at her. I did find myself distracted trying to work out the maximum number of generations there could have been between the guy kidnapping the first woman and the mother, doesn't seem enough to produce something this grotesque, maybe they should have left the time line a bit more loose by having the guy already dead and in some state of decomposition when they discover him. But that's just a minor issue. They did a really good job of adding depth to the mother without her really speaking. Great movie for the genre. I'd have probably scored higher if I hadn't known about the twist. It's one of those movies, like Usual Suspects, that does something new and unexpected and sort of ruins some films that follow, because they will either imitate it (poorly) or disappoint you because you think there's a twist coming and spend half the film trying to work out when it will drop but it never arrives!",2023-10-04
"This film really caught my interest after watching the trailer and hearing all of the praise about it. The movie started off very strong, but I felt like there were some stories that never really got a proper closure. She booked the Airbnb, because she needed a place to stay for her upcoming job interview. Fast forward the next day, she goes on the interview, it goes well, and she gets the job. And although she goes through something traumatic, there is no time jump or anything to where we get to see her at the job. It makes it seem like she went through all of that for nothing. Justin Long's character was accused of something very serious. We did hear about a few things that happened to him as a result of it. But we didn't get to see much and I felt like that was due to a time crunch and them wanting to rush to the third act. I did enjoy the movie and it finally made sense once the homeless guy explained everything. However I don't see myself rewatching it.",2022-10-30
"As a 23 year old male who hasn't been scared of any movies in at least a decade, this movie had me scared, like cover my eyes with my sweater scared. And never in the way where its a jump scare type cause that's cheap and not truly scary like what i felt. I am extremely impressed by the acting of Georgina Campbell as Tessa. She played that girl so good i was on the edge of my seat at times. They really couldn't have filmed this movie in a better location, at least in the US. The beginning is slow but it's important to know and the movie was written to make you think certain things but then it's revealed and it's not something you would expect.Overall i recommend this movie & recommend to watch this with friend(s) or a partner.",2022-10-16
"This movie was terrible. It was like hills have eyes in Detroit. All the characters make stupid decisions amd Tess is just the dumbest human ever created. She lost her black card, her common sense card and her believability. Backstory made no sense to why what was happening was happening. I hoped it would get better. I prayed. My prayers were not answered.....
.........

Im.supposed to write more about this movie but I'd rather watch the home shopping network or the 700 Club than to think about this movie anymore. If there is a hell imagined, it's having to watch that movie again, which was an attack on my intelligence and patience for everyone's stupidity.",2023-10-26
What happened here? Nothing but a bunch of loose-end storylines. It's as if they ran out of money mid production and forgot to tie any of the plot points together.... What started as an enjoyable thriller quickly diverged into a near-comical story. The Justin Long backstory? What was the purpose of the lengthy exposition as it offered nothing to the overall story other than he needed to scrap together money for a defense attorney. Quick a long winded unnecessary journey. Don't expect too much other than a few nice jump screams but otherwise do t get invested in any of the backstories of the principals as these are unimportant to the story at all.,2022-10-07
"This movie feels like 3 movies. The first part (movie) is really slow and boring, but sets up the 2nd and 3rd. It is SO slow and boring, they feel the need to show her going potty... twice. The second part (movie) is humorous. I enjoyed it. The third part (movie) offers the climax to the movie, and has the opportunity to be great, to answer a lot of asked questions, and to follow through on plot points that were set up in the first 2/3 of the movie... but doesn't follow through. I was left suffering from plot holes and a slightly unsatisfying conclusion to a story that promised intrigue and monsters, but never really delivered.Overall, meh.",2022-09-25
"I love scary and while this is not 2 hours of 'true horror' it brought me along for an intense and ever-changing ride. You think this is one type of scary movie when you start watching and then half way through BAM Justin Long is there and just when you're ready to fall into his story you're like OH YEAH what about..... Very cool, very (at times) uncomfy, and ultimately awesome take on the horror genre. I oscillated between talking to my TV telling characters what to do and absolute uncomfortable but invested silence throughout the ride. I listen to a Justin Longs podcast and for a while every guest has taken a moment to tell him how interesting and incredible Barbarian was and now I understand why it's worth mentioning.",2023-02-04
"I don't agree with the comments and ratings here. I just watched the movie in a theater in LA and I have to say I can only rate it 6 and that would be my max. This definitely is not a 7.6 rating movie. In horror category its very difficult to find a movie that deserves an above 7 rating so when I saw this one is above 7, I was excited to go and see but only to be disappointed. I don't understand, how come people have rated this above 7?! The production itself is very limited in terms of location, almost all of the plot runs in an house, the characters are very limited, the budget must be very limited too..",2022-09-11
"Those of the audience who were born and raised in the United States, without a real experience of seeing this country from the outside in, may really face some difficulty in assimilating the subtexts of this fun horror movie beyond the more accessible one, related to moral issues.This movie looks like two short films linked by the same character with a small expository interlude.And the book Jane Eyre that appears right after the arrival of the character played by Justin Long in the house also gives some clues about the unfolding of the plot and that's very cool.The strengths of this film lie in the surprises of the script, the use of clichés from various horror sub-genres in an interesting and creative way. Really a great launch to enjoy this Halloween 2022.",2022-10-29
"Barbarian is a throwback to the type of horror films my friends and I would see at drive-ins back in the late seventies through the eighties (the original Evil Dead films, for example). I notice a lot of these reviewers are thrown off by the final act, which is indeed bonkers but is precisely what makes this film so much fun. I wish I would've seen it with an audience - there are a couple of scenes in that final act that I can imagine caused an uproar. Try to see it blind and prepare to apply the necessary suspension of disbelief involved in almost any horror film (serious or not) and you shall be entertained!",2022-10-30
"This movie plays with all the sterotypes of the genre in such a delightful way that it could easily turn in an instant horror classic.Great acting, great photography and music, it's really fun to watch and it makes you jump off the chair with goosebumps several times.Again, there are all the elements of the most typical horror movie (don't want to spoiler but of course there is a cellar in a cursed house..) but finally after so many years of useless plots in this genre, finally I had the same fun I could have had the first time I saw The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.I bet the screenwriters had a great time making the plot..Mission accomplished.",2022-12-03
"I see a lot of people likeing this film, but it wasn´t that much of a big deal. You get almost in the middle of the movie a change of history, that is actually interesting. But it happens again later. One time is fine, two times is boring. By other words, this film is not predictable but it lacks of that fear feeling. If you are looking for a good horror movie like You're Next, Smile... This is not the best of this decade or what you are looking for. I'm a big horror fan and i like some suspense and scary moments. This one is not scary at all, doesn't have any jump scares. You can only enjoy the mediocre history.",2022-10-26
"The pacing of the film was very interesting. At peak horrifying moments it would often cut to calm seemingly unrelated scenes to provide more context. I enjoyed how information was revealed throughout the film.The film started off strong and did a good job of subverting expectations with interesting twists and turns. However, the more you learned about what was going on, the less scary the film became. It dealt with dark concepts and themes, but most of the horror took place offscreen in the backstory of the film. I did enjoy learning the story and about the horrors and it gave the environment much more prominence and character than most horror films.Spoilers beyond this pointParticularly the main antagonist of the film is revealed to desire only to be a caretaker. I guess there is still horror in being trapped somewhere against your will, but it's established that if you know how to behave in front of the caretaker there is basically no threat to physical harm. I feel like the film would have stayed scary if they made the audience less sympathetic to the caretaker and had them be more unstable.The last quarter of the film felt less original and very stereotypical horror. Would have loved if it had a better ending.I feel like there was a missed opportunity for greatness in this film that the second half ruined. Definitely scary, compelling storytelling style, and intriguing backstory. It just fell short on horror halfway through by removing the treat of bodily harm and becoming more predictable.",2022-11-07
"Over half way into watching this and have only glimpsed a female looking Ghoul mother in the basement.Nothing else apart from hanging around watching trivia scenes. . waiting for the buckets of blood etc.Great to see Bill in this really. Great actor who gets the tension started by his unseemly presence.You never quite know which side of the fence he's on. Nice guy, awkward underlying temper type.Interesting to watch him play this mystery part.My one wonder how is why did they choose to have the Jane Eyre as a book inside the suitcase? A moment of intrigue.Quite a good second story to get running over the first abrupt end. Shall see how it goes.Hope this might be of some . . Use. So far so good...",2022-11-11
"I don't even know how to explain what i just watched. So much happened and yet so little, the multiple story lines make it slightly hard to follow and once it all clicks you feel as lost as when you began, it's got a lot of gore so if you're not into that maybe don't watch. The gore that is included is very detailed and shown in full view which made me quite disturbed at times. The characters are decent you do however find yourself screaming at them not to do something stupid just for them to do it but that is the issue with most horror movies. Just finished and now silence as words can't even describe what i feel.",2023-01-21
"I found Barbarian to be a fascinating and great addition to the horror genre. It feels fresh and original with genuine allure and intrigue. It's instantly engaging and continually engaging. From beginning to end, I found it to be absolutely thrilling and just when you think it's over, it's actually just getting starting. The movie is ultimately one of the best horror movies that I've watched in a pretty long time and I would highly recommend it to any horror fan, or even someone who's just in the mood for something to help pass the day away. I really don't think that you will walk away disappointed.",2023-04-16
"It almost felt like they ran out of money or changed production team half way through.A great start with a tense build up between the Air B&B characters. After the introduction of the ""Barbarian"" in the tunnel the scene cuts to a new chapter which I thought was intertwined with the house pretty well.The moment Richard Brake entered the room I knew it was curtains for the rest of the movie as this guy is always in a klanger.As for the ""Barbarian"" ...she / it could have been better but I've watched worse.Overall a Solid start that lost its way with a not so good ending. Having said that I still enjoyed it and it's worth a watch for sure.",2023-10-09
"The first act of this movie is suspenseful and keeps you on your toes the only problem I have is the abrupt (and very strange) second act where the story changed from the characters that you've grown to like and admire to a character who your only introduced to halfway through the film. Bill Skarsgard in particular is creepy in his role maybe because I can instantly recognise him as IT but still his unnerving yet endearing character I grew to like and halfway through the film he's gone? Quite strange but I suppose bold and inventive writing? The character of Tess was refreshing as she's not your typical final girl she was intelligent (up until she went down an unlit tunnell when she had a phone, alone). But I do appreciate the social commentary on limited police resources in an impoverished area sometimes it just felt too convenient. All in all, a solid film, a good premise but a slightly bizarre third act.",2022-11-07
"Wow.... From the previews of this movie I genuinely did not know what to expect from it, but it definitely wasn't this. I thoroughly enjoyed it though. I can see why some wouldn't like it, especially the ending which was a bit lacking. You will be saying ""WTF??"" through the entire movie for all different reasons; between the questionable choices of the characters and the utterly shocking/strange scenes throughout. There are quite a few frustrating moments as with most horror films, but the overall weirdness of this one is what I think sets it apart from others. I definitely recommend watching, and don't bother with the trailer, go in blind for an even weirder experience.",2022-11-01
"The beginning of the movie was filled with suspense and I couldn't wait for some unexpected plot twists. But the atmosphere that was built up, was ruined for me by all the horror movie cliches, cops won't come, main character puts herself in danger, nobody comes to help etc.Also I think that the scene where Keith was attacked was ruined and the question how did our main character find out her intentions after witnessing the underground mother smashing Keith's head into the wall could have been interesting. (for me at least)Yet there were some moments that I did enjoy. I think the concept of cops not trusting you because of the environment and state you are in resonates true with some parts of the real world.AJ's character had an interesting concept: A psycho who justifies his worst wrongdoings and ignores similarities between him and the old man in the basement.",2023-01-01
"Saw the trailers, talked to some friends who watched it, and being a horror fan for a few decades still was very pleasantly surprised.This is a textbook example of how to make a thrilling, exciting, funny and pretty much different movie that people will like.Sure, it starts kinda confusing, and when it switched to Justin Long in his Alfa it produced a WTF moment. But it´s so well put together and coherent in every way that I enjoyed it from start to finish. And was hungry for more.The cast is excellent. And Detroit being what it is sure as hell provided an excellent backdrop to the story.This is one of those special movies that you want to see again. And that´s just one detail that makes ""Barbarian"" special.I don´t want to reveal anything about the plot because it would just be wrong to do that.But I will give a piece of advice: see it without reading about it and except it with open heart and mind. Because in today´s cinematic world of remakes and superhero creeps, this is probably the best movie that I have seen all year. Or was it a decade?",2022-11-24
"The first 30 minutes was somewhat interesting and generated an unfulfilled ""hype"" . Unnecessarily dark in some scenes, yet it's lacking in mystery . It gets two yawns out of six which is equivalent of five stars, the overall experience was attention grabbing (until it wasn't) . The actors were professional and they presented a good overall performance. On one hand at the end it feels like they were running out of time but on the other hand they don't really have a lot of action to pack into the movie..
I would recommend it to those who doesn't have the stomach for the ""bloody&gore"" style.It's worth to give it a try, you might gonna like it.",2022-10-27
"Talk to Me is a stone cold classic of the horror genre. It feels fresh, thrilling, absorbing, and has a brilliant concept at its core.The story follows a group of friends who play around with the occult, contacting the spirit world through a mysterious ceramic hand. As you might expect, things go off the rails quickly and insidious activity ensues.The way the story is set up is superb, giving a fresh spin on a somewhat tired horror trope and bringing it into the 21st century with style.It contains a strong collection of characters with great performances behind them all and solid writing that doesn't feel cliche or tired.Stylistically I think the film is superb, with the direction on point. There are some neat creative flourishes and a brilliant use of sound, both of which really contribute to the overall atmosphere, which is one of constant suspense and unease.I don't think the film is particularly scary, relying more on body horror and disturbing imagery, but it is very unnerving and tense nonetheless.The only reason I'm not scoring this higher is that I think some of the concepts could have been taken a little further, and some of the horror dialled up a notch, but these are minor criticisms really.Talk to Me is one of the most refreshing and engaging horror films I've seen in a while, and will be sure to be a treat for any horror fans out there.",2023-07-25
"A group of youngsters discover that by taking part in a small ritual involving an embalmed, ceramic hand, that they're able to contact spirits from the other side.One of the better horror films I've seen for some time, when I compare to the other horrors I've seen in 2023, this rates as the best so far.Talk to me has a degree of originality, it's loaded with jump scares, and has some genuinely memorable moments. The writing was rather good, everything pieced together nicely, including that pretty shocking opening sequence.Quite graphic at times, it wasn't afraid to show a bit of gore, eyeball, that's all I'm saying, I had to look away. I loved that deliciously dark closing scene, it was such a strong, cohesive end to the film, it really worked.There were a couple of clichés, and there were a couple of moments where you're left scratching your head, puzzling whether people would actually do the things that happened here, but those are minor faults, the only major gripe I had, was the rebirth of The Crazy Frog music (I thought our ears had been spared that years ago.)They trailered Cobweb and Nun 2, will either of them surpass this one? Will have to wait and see.A big thumbs up.8/10.",2023-08-03
"Danny and Michael Philippou have truly made something special here and hope it gets the attention it deserves. Known by their YouTube channel ""RackaRacka"" They were able to pull off a great low budget horror film on the budget of $4.5 million Australian dollars that feels at least 20 million.The cinematography and direction were all incredible with some expertly crafted scenes and a very dark and foreboding story that does have some originality to it despite being another supernatural, hell-demon, ""other side"" story. The scenes with the hand were legitimately scary and tense with a very unpredictable nature to it, the rest of the story was surprisingly unpredictable and unconventional, that also captures the modern Australian generation very well.The acting in this movie was off the charts and really delivered every emotion these characters were feeling at any given time and their reaction to exactly what was happening, internally and externally. The movie does depict Australian Gen Zérs pretty well, me being one of them. They did use it to their advantage in this movie, with RackaRacka being Gen Z as well, they were able to nail their modern Australian characters to perfection.The movie really did have an impactful effect on me, with me starting to feel a little ill by the end of the movie and me processing what all had just happened that I won't spoil in this review. Overall, the tone didn't just feel like shallow horror, but a legitimate one that actually has a foothold in Australian society that did feel somewhat believable in certain areas. The tension was soaring and ever present, the music was great too, there weren't many jump scares in this but the scary scenes themselves were clever and hard hitting.The movie didn't just fly by either, it did feel like it did run a bit longer than just 90 minutes and I did appreciate how it held my attention the way it did. I did feel genuine dread from it, that I haven't felt from a horror movie like this in a VERY long time. If not ever. The only problem I had with it is that I wished the story was a bit more revelatory and not so secretive in a lot of areas.Go see it if you're a fan of Horror and Modern Australian Cinema. I hope this brings nothing but success for The Philippou Brothers and the film has already gotten recognition by several popular horror directors including Jordan Peele.",2023-07-27
"I watched Talk to Me early as part of Regal's Mystery Movie Monday. It's a movie I'd already planned on seeing, so I was happy with the choice while also having no idea what to expect. I came out of the movie very mixed.There are lots of positives, the biggest being some truly awesome horror moments. My jaw dropped multiple times at some of these brutal moments. And with an R-rating, it didn't have to hold back. I wish more movies had the courage to do this instead of opting for a milder PG-13 movie, pandering to the casuals and teens.The movie is mostly well-made. I love how loud the sound effects are. Sophie Wilde gives a great performance and Joe Bird has some amazing moments. It also uses the horror premise in a few unique ways, making it more like a game or a drug.Unfortunately not everything works. It doesn't seem like it knows where to go and doesn't come together all that well. A few of the scares involve grossing out the audience. I don't find gross to be scary. It's just nasty.But the worst thing, for me at least, is I was not nearly as engaged as I should have been during the climax. I wasn't on the edge of my seat. I was sort of just... there.I heard someone call this the Smile of 2023, a surprise horror flick that comes out of nowhere and blows everyone away. I don't think it comes close to Smile, my favorite movie of last year.I can see some people loving this, but I can't personally recommend it.(1 viewing, Mystery Movie Monday 7/10/2023)",2023-07-11
"The premise was what initially drew me to this film, although it's not that different from similar movies in the genre. Replacing the Ouija board with a ceramic hand was a creative and unique touch that the horror genre needs more of, and for that alone this movie deserves some recognition. Creativity and ingenuity are the two elements that the horror genre is sorely lacking, and it's great to see how the new generation is utilizing premises that have been done countless times before and giving them an unexpected spin. That being said, that's about the only thing about this movie that is worth praising.If you've ever seen a movie about demonic possession, spirit conjuring, or communicating with the dead via an Ouija board, you've already seen this film. Aside from the method being used, this has been done plenty of times before, and at times I found myself wondering if the people who made this have ever seen a movie in the genre before, because almost every idea was ripped form some other movie. There were so many ways you could have made this movie truly ingenious, but they kept it safe and did the basic ""let's gather a bunch of teens together to communicate with the dead"" that has already been done TO DEATH so many times. I wish they would have pushed the envelope, going for stuff that was more shocking instead of treading familiar ground. It's what made me ultimately not care much about what transpired in the film.The nail on the coffin was the cast, though. Filling a movie with insufferable and unlikable teenagers and young adults completely removed me from the experience. Similar to ""Bodies Bodies Bodies', the cast was a bunch of try-hard teenagers with nasty attitudes, poor behavior and partaking in degenerate behavior that always sits very poorly with me. I'm so glad I neither had friends like any of these people, and that I never had the misfortune of interacting with anyone who behaved this badly in my youth. I believe the movie would have been more effective with an adult cast, but that's just my personal taste.Overall, a novel concept with mediocre execution makes for a somewhat entertaining film that I didn't regret watching but that I really can't be bothered to recommend. Aside from one scene that was really effective in instilling fear and dread, the rest of the movie is a retread of every Ouija board film you've ever seen. Where a movie like SMILE brings something new and original to the genre, Talk To Me just brings the same old concepts in the palm of a new hand.",2023-09-13
"Quite literally - and no pun intended of course. Also you have to suspend your disbelief ... like really really suspend it. If you'd ask any of the characters how ... well not intelligent they are, they would answer ... yes. Now if that sounds like it doesn't make sense ... it is because it doesn't make sense ... which I hope makes sense to say/write. It does to me of course.If you are able to handle those things that I would call flaws and not be annoyed by them ... well the movie is every bit as good as you may have heard it is. The horror is quite frightening - the story is tight and the ending ... well that has quite the impact to it. And even if you may see it coming ... it is so well shot and done, it won't matter.A24 knows their stuff and their movies are being hailed for the right reasons most of the time. They are also not easy movies to watch. Violence (peak) and horror of every kind ... you've been warned. Be different than the characters here and heed those warnings ... and act accordingly.",2023-04-24
"Well, I actually had high expectations for this. Read a lot of positive stuff, damn my English teacher. Anyway what we have here is a good idea, ruined by a bunch of characters I hated. A bunch of whiny, self centered teens, with smarts somewhere between a Mars bar and a US President. Mustn't forget some of the stoopidist suspension of logic flaws I've seen in a horror movie for some time. After the Police arrived, and left, the whole plot collapsed. For a horror movie to really work, it has to draw you in with realistic, everyday likelihoods. The cops would have shut the house down, taken all the phone footage and confiscated the hand. They did none of the above.. Now a hand that allows you to contact the dead I'm prepared to give a pass. A bunch of Aussies finest, walking away from a blood splattered crime scene without a hint of concern.. Well your taking the p**s aren't you mate! The Cinematography however was excellent. Kudos to them.",2023-09-13
"I'll take any bet - any good old Alice Cooper show is still more horrifying as Talk to Me. The art of horror in this film boils down to a few pictures; the rest is just a generic mess with storytelling in slow mo (I was almost asleep until something happened, and I should have given in to the powers of Morpheus...). It's filled with characters that nobody but a select few will care about. On top, on the horror-o-meter, this rates very low. Maybe if you're still not in your teens, you'll get some goosebumps. Anyway, I really don't know why, even in an exciting genre like horror, where almost anything goes, I got the impression that everyone involved in making the movie (and other ""horror"" movies too) treated it like a chore. Verdict: boring, generic, heartless. On the pro side: production is solid.",2023-09-12
"I've spoken in the past about being a big fan of Australian horror movies. Some of my all time favourites have come from this country. So it's a little disappointing that the last two Australian horror movies I've watched ('Run Rabbit Run' and 'Talk to Me') have been a bit of a let down. The latter was nowhere near as big of a let down as the former to be fair. There were parts of this film I liked, but overall it didn't quite hit the right spots.I'm finding possession films less and less scary with every year that goes by. I find that as soon as you see the ghosts/demons it's just too hard to believe (even though the make-up work in 'Talk to Me' was very well done). The only time it really works for me any more is in films like 'Paranormal Activity' where you rarely actually see anything. Seeing less will always be more in this circumstance.So I didn't find the film overly scary, and then all I really have to fall back on is the characters. Sadly we've reached a point where the only way to write realistic teenage characters any more is to make them extremely unpleasant. If they were all overly nice it wouldn't feel like they were properly written, yet if they are particularly unpleasant then it isn't much fun to watch them. It's a real predicament that the horror genre has and I don't know the way around it.I will say that the ghosts/demons were done in such a way that if that is the kind of thing that scares you I could see this movie being very effective and creepy. Otherwise though, you might be fresh out of luck with this one. 6/10.",2023-07-28
"What drew my interest in this film was the high IMDb reviews, especially for the horror genre which is the most scrutinized. The plot is pretty basic.... evil and supernatural forces begin to manifest by touching an embalmed hand. I love horror films but I've always treated them like an amusement park ride. They don't need a sophisticated plot but certainly a good screenplay, creepy atmosphere, pacing, uncomfortable tension, and just plain scary. I'll get straight to the pros and cons:Pros:1. Good cinematography and quality of acting.2. Because of the lower budget, the film wasn't flooded with CGI. Some of the scenes were pretty creepy. One scene had a dark atmosphere about it that reminded me of a scene from Hereditary.Cons:1. Way too much filler. I understand and appreciate setting things up for character attachment/development but the first 25-30 min was a snooze fest.2. Screenplay was too disjointed and had a pacing problem. The scenes involving the hand were good but all the in-between segments with the characters were uninteresting for the most part. At times I was wondering with a particular character if this was horror or a drama.3. Weak final act. When it's all said and done this movie is about a few entertaining and even scary scenes and a lot of messy writing all over the place. Are they trying too hard? Should they have focused on a different angle if the goal was to make this story deeper? You be the judge. Honestly I think this would have made a really good 12-13 minute short film.Is this movie on the level of 2018's Hereditary? Heck no. Is it worth watching? Honesty yes. With great horror movies few and far between, you can get a few thrills out of it and appreciate the potential that could have been. Decent but could have been so much more...",2023-08-03
"Another week, another jumpscare demon summoning movie. This time from Australia, but aside from the accents it looks and feels entirely American. The usual ingredients are all there. A cast of annoying, loudmoth, diverse, phone addicted teenagers come across cursed artifact that allows them to contact the spirit realm and become briefly possessed. In this film it's an embalmed hand.Naturally the main characters have a traumatic backstory, with their mother having passed in an untimely manner. They end up talking to her, but stay connected to the other side for too long. Bad things happen.If you've suffered through bad music, bad acting and bad party scenes until that point in the film, you can be relieved. Things do get better, which is a rarity for the horror genre. Usually they start strong and run out of steam. This one is the opposite. It significantly improves as it goes along.There are some good ideas here, but sadly they're never fully developed or fully explained. The ending is by far the strongest part of the film, but the buildup to it remains virtually unexplained. It's a pity, because there would have been room for a good moral dilemma. Still, the last scene is great and redeems the second half of the film.On a technical level, the film is competently made. The color grading looks really nice, which is almost a rarity in films these days. The scary scenes are very well filmed and the audio editing is top notch. Audio is the most important aspect of a horror film, and they nail it here. The rotating camera gimmick is fun, but gets overused.If you can get through the horrible first half, you might get some enjoyment out of this. Overall, I couldn't enjoy it. The teens were just too annoying, and the conflict and plot too trite.",2023-08-25
"Talk to Me (not a very scary name) is about some teenagers who promote themselves on social media by having strange seances where they use a hand that can summon the dead. But one night, one of them holds onto the hand a little too long and the demons start to chase the teenagers and cause chaos in their lives.This should have been a more rewarding premise, but about midway through the film the story begins to have too many plots that it fails to develop and loses track of what made it such an interesting premise in the first place. Also, there are some really dumb things that happen in this movie. It's not a film where the main characters try to solve a problem more than it's just the character go around in circles.",2023-07-29
"A24 has a way of putting out these supposedly great arthouse horror films, but they almost all feel like the story is an afterthought once the filmmakers have come up with their premise. This film is a perfect example of that.Midway through the film, the characters actions and their motivations seem more and more unbelievable until the end when you can't help but think that the main character is either the most naive individual to walk the planet or just willfully ignorant to what is happening to her. The story gets pretty convoluted and the rules of how the hand is supposed to work is never clearly outlined, nor do we find out anything about the hand or it's origin or how these random kids in Australia have it or how the kids all way across the world at the end have it. One of the rare films where I would've like some elaboration on what was going on.Also, this film forgets the most important part of being a horror film. It's just not scary. Jumpscares only take you so far. Everybody talking about this film being brutal and shocking must be lying as well. If seeing someone hit their head on a table or a wall is gruesome to you just because blood is present, I'd have to say you're very weak stomached.Overall, a disappointing film. It is well made and the premise is a solid one. It's just a shame the filmmakers didn't do more with it.2.5 psychic hands out of 5.",2023-07-28
"I had pretty high hopes for this movie. I like A24 films usually, and the first 20 minutes had a couple freaky parts that I enjoyed.Then unfortunately it was back to extremely long and extremely boring reaction shots, and completely overblown sounds. (Pillows hitting a person sounded like a concrete block being dropped onto the sidewalk, and a girl slapping her head 15 times that made my eardrums blow out.)The ""spirits"" she first saw were pretty damn scary, but then it just devolved into typical ""dead person"" makeup and cloudy eyes. Along with just gross-out gore which isn't very scary. Really ended up disappointed overall. The concept was pretty cool and they could have done a lot with it (contacting spirits as a viral trend), but they really dropped the ball.And of course you could see the ending coming a mile away.",2023-08-01
"I feel like I am the only person that thought this movie was very average and lackluster. Being an A24 film, it's stylish, with great cinematography and overall good acting. But I thought most of the characters were unlikable and the story felt hollow. It felt like it was taking bits and pieces from other horror movies that it thought would work to formulate another good horror movie. The practical effects are excellent and I always appreciate the use of less CGI which helps ground any film in more realism. The movie also tries to have a deeper message and metaphors, but these also fall apart with the story telling. By the end it felt forgettable. I wanted to like it but sadly it's a dud for me.",2023-08-04
"The whole cast is superb. Unfortunately, the plot isn't as great and it's not ''atmospheric'' enough to pretend to not care about a plot. As much as I wanted it not to be, it remained a cliché from beginning to end. Not a terrible one and it had some innovations here and there but if it weren't for the cast carrying out the scenes so well, it would have been yet another horror movie.Spoiler : To me the plot really took a cheaper path when the mother was introduced. This is nothing more than the usual ''evil spirit passing as a loved one to trick you into letting them in'' which is 90% of possession-themed movies and nothing new seemed to have been added here.The story also feels more rushed towards the end in that the directors are trying to simultaneously commit to multiple ideas that are not fully developed and nourished.5/10 made 6/10 for the spot on acting.",2023-07-24
"I'm so impressed. I haven't been stricken with genuine horror and a deep feeling of dread watching a movie in so long. I am at that point in my life where I thought horror just wasn't going to do it any more, but this movie proved me wrong. Literally reignited my childhood paranormal phobia and made a cat in someones window jump scare me on the walk home. Totally fresh and unique concept with lore that has you hooked and wanting to know more. It's simplicity with no desire to wrap things up nicely or follow a simple horror formula really worked in its favour. Sound design was amazing and so sharp, in the cinema you're gonna flinch. The soundtrack was just so cool too. Just watch this in the cinema if you can please, you're in for a treat.I am so eager to see where the promise of this director goes.",2023-08-02

Keeps you on the edge of your seat.I will eagerly await what the directors do next, and will watch out for the cast in other things.If you like it creepy give it a go. There have been some very average horrors out in the last 12 months, this one is a cut above.",2023-07-24
"This is one of the most unique horror films I've seen in years. The plot is relatively simple: teens get their hands on a mysterious embalmed hand that allows them to see and chat with the dead. Predictably, they do not use this ability responsibly, and they end up breaking the 'rules'. Hijinks ensue. There are a couple of gruesome scenes that aren't for the faint of heart, but they are thankfully brief. I wouldn't say the level of scares is very high, but it does a good job of delivering a few jump scares, being atmospheric, and leaning into its concept. Excellent, highly recommend to any aficionado of the genre.",2023-07-30
"I really hoped the trailer had left out the best bits but sadly not. You won't see anything better in the film that wasn't in the trailer. The film was intreguing at the start but led to very little and the less said about the end the better. Nothing very original and not scary at all. As is the case with many modern horror's, there's the odd irritating character I wish had met their grizzly end but once again sadly not. The acting was what You'd expect from horror but can't see any awards going it's way. My advice is to wait for whichever streaming site picks it up and if there is nothing else to watch give it a try.",2023-08-09
"This stands out from your jump scare or just plain poor plot horror movies. I watch as much horror as I can and this was an original idea and very well written. After the movie, you will piece together more and more of how it all ties together.Scary, yet enough twists to keep you on the edge of your seat until the end. The acting was very good and really ties in with the themes in the film.This is more of the stick with you, creepy, dread, existential type horror, but also had many scary scenes.Also love to see a movie like this create a star actor and get picked up for distribution at Sundance.

What i missed in this movie: there were like almost no jumpscares, and i personally think that's one of the most important things for a horror movie. I think the performances are great.

All the main characters are unlikable and rather stupid.I found the whole thing quite boring and there was no logic in anything that happened. Yes, I know it's a horror movie, but still, it has to involve something that keeps your interest - and that part is missing. When the main character show her stupidity when finding a wounded animal by the road - You just out of reasons to care for that person at all.So why all the good reviews?

"Once again, we have a horror film that doesn't have a single new or interesting idea and yet it's praised to the heavens. It's as if the critics haven't actually seen enough horror films to recognize that everything in this film has been done before and done much better.Once again, we have a group of sarcastic partying teens (or thereabouts) who manage, through their own stupidity, to summon evil visions followed by actual evil deeds. That they each experience horrifying results from what is passed off as a party game does not deter them in the least.Two sentences are thrown in to take a stab at explaining the evil porcelain hand and then it's off to the races. Where did it come from? What might explain its effects? What's the basis for the ritual that makes it work? Who knows? Not the filmmakers, apparently.The leads are appealing actors but their efforts are wasted in this mess.Fans of mindless brutality may find something of interest here because it's nothing if not brutal. But everyone else should wait until it streams if they feel the need to see it.",2023-07-11
"A friend and I went to watch this with great anticipation after watching several stellar reviews on YouTube from folks I typically share movie taste with. We left feeling pretty letdown and confused, I must say.Thing is: this movie had lots going for it-a great concept, plenty of opportunity for character-building, brilliant performances, and it looked great. Was it ""the scariest movie in the last year or so""? Hardly. But whatever-horror fans are easily desensitized to thrills and chills.What this movie lacked was intelligent, fleshed out and compelling storytelling and characterization (a depressing trend in today's cinema). Frustratingly, the subplots and characters were all there to exploit but wound up going nowhere-totally underdeveloped. There were also lots of interesting details dropped in the first act or so of the film that were never followed up on, to the point that you left, wondering why these things were even introduced in the first place because they served no real story purpose.I can't emphasize enough the acting talent of the leads because it would have taken very little to create fully developed character arcs here and a narrative that your audience is really invested in.There's no amount of technical skill that can make up for sloppy or rushed writing. If these newcomers spent more time analyzing what makes a good story and the craft of characterization, and slightly less time on the technical aspects of filmmaking, they ultimately wind up with better films. I hope they develop their craft further and take such feedback to heart because writing as an art form is being sorely underemphasized in filmmaking, to its great detriment.",2023-08-02

Is just plain boring and the premise is stupid. At the end everyone was so dumb I could care less how it would end and the ending is just so predictable, if you think you are going to see gruesome murders or scary stuff trust me this film ain't any of that.What a waste of potential.",2023-08-12
"I have 3 very big problems with this movie.First of all this is a well tried trope and very common story. We have seen this in movies before, seen it in TV shows, and read it in books. This is immensely cliche. And as such you need to do something special with it, and you need to find some angle or extra to make it stand out, but no. This is just a cliche as you might think. No thought process whatsoever.Secondly this is amateurish. Everything is. This looks like, feels like and is acted like a middle-school project made by failing drama students. I could get behind some of that, horror does not need to have a huge cgi budget, but it cannot be amateurish on all levels, on all things.Thirdly, is this actually a horror movie? The premiss is boring and cliche, and there is nothing really scary or weird or thought-provoking about this. And the ending? Omg... so predictable that if you did not see that coming, I am sorry, but if so you need a doctor.I cannot find any redeeming traits or positives about this. I will still give it a 2/10 because however strange it may sound this is not the worst movie of the year. I do not think this movie will even make it into top 10 worse of the year... isn't that sad?",2023-09-13
"Talk To Me, the debut movie from Aussie directors Danny and Michael Philippou (the men behind popular YouTube channel RackaRacka), feels more Blumhouse than it does A24, and as far as I am concerned that's a good thing. It's far less pretentious and arthouse than I had expected, and a lot less boring.Sophie Wilde plays Mia, who attends a party where her friends dabble with the occult, using a porcelain hand that has the power to connect the living with the dead: all a person has to do is hold the hand and say 'Talk to me'. The important thing to remember is not to hold on for longer than 90 seconds. Of course, Mia does just that, leaving the door wide open for unwelcome spirits to come a-visiting.A likeable cast, plenty of creepiness, a smidge of uncomfortable brutality (the standout scenes involving some nasty self harm), and a neat ending ensure that Talk To Me is a thoroughly entertaining ride from start to finish. Sure, some characters make questionable choices in the film, but that is par for the course for a teen horror, and it doesn't detract too much from the fun. Was I scared? Not really, but then it takes a lot to scare me these days. Was I entertained? You betcha!",2023-07-25
Movie was not scary. At all. We were excited to see this considering the high reviews and people saying they fainted in the theater. It was NOT SCARY. Started off promising but it dropped off very quick. Ending was stupid. They didn't explain anything either. Should have been a movie that went straight to Hulu. Don't waste your money.The premise behind it was interesting but characters just stopped showing up that were involved. It made no sense. The only good scene was when the teen tried the hand and started slamming himself and taking out his eye ball. That was the ONLY scene in the movie worth watching.,2023-07-30
"Just returned from the cinema, what a waste of time.This movie was very much under my expectations.Poor acting, boring plot, or perhaps was not even a plot...I really had expectations from this movie but was a boring, short story with just two creepy scenes.Not worth the time...It looks like this was a movie made by some amateurs from Australia.I am a real fan of horror movies of any kind, but this was ""dust in your eyes"", a movie made in a hurry just to be there and to take the money of fools...
Somehow the high rating from imdb for this movie is misleading.In conclusion one of the most boring ""horror""movie that I saw in 2023.",2023-08-13
"The opening scene was the strongest part of the movie, it is shocking and instantly grabs your attention. However, that energy doesn't carry over to the rest of the film.This is an example of an idea outweighing its execution. The concept of the embalmed hand used to conjure spirits was unique but aside from that this film doesn't do anything special. The main character grieves the loss of her mother and wishes to connect with her so she uses the hand to do so. This film reminded me a bit of ""Insidious Chapter 3"" but it wasn't as good. There is only one other scene besides the opening scene that has any kind of tension or suspense. This film lacked atmospheric horror as well as jump scares. There wasn't even anything creepy about the spirits that were conjured.The origin of the embalmed hand wasn't concrete as some characters had different stories as to where the hand came from. It would have been nice if they just picked an idea and stuck with it.The development of every single character in this movie was bare bones. The main character was grieving her mother and didn't have a good relationship with her father. Her father was made to seem like he had an important role in the film but he didn't. She had a best friend who had a little brother and a boyfriend. The dynamics between all of those characters are very cliché and corny.This film was a waste of time and a complete let down. The only good thing about it was that it was over rather quickly.",2023-08-04
"I'll start with positives. The film was shot really well so credit to cinematographer Aaron McLisky and his team for their efforts.Both practical and special effects were top quality throughout, I never felt anything looked fake. The makeup was actually very effective with the spirits and with the whole Riley incident. Particularly when he injures himself and the scenes subsequently where he is in the hospital are well done. He does look battered and bruised in a gruesome way. Finally, I thought the acting throughout was also good, I can't knock that at all, but there are significant issues, and it's all the writing for me.The film needed so many re-writes to get it where it needed to be. I get annoyed and disappointed worst of all, when films that try to take you somewhere, can only get you there by making the actions of the characters be the most stupid they could be.I won't go into a massively detailed full story retread, but suffice it to say that the film follows Mia (Sophie Wilde). Mia is an emotionally vulnerable teenager who is still recovering alongside her father Max (Marcus Johnson) over the suicide of Mia's mother Rhea (Alexandria Steffensen) two years prior.Mia ends up going to a party hosted by friends Hayley (Zoe Terakes) and Joss (Chris Alosio) who have an embalmed hand supposedly from a psychic. It can apparently allow any individual to be taken over by a spirit if they say 'talk to me' and then give permission to let the spirit into their bodies.Mia has a best friend called Jade (Alexandra Jensen), who has a younger brother called Riley (Joe Bird). Riley winds up using the hand against Jade's wishes and ushered on by Mia. Riley seemingly gets inhabited by the spirit of Mia's dead mother Rhea. Mia at this point has herself already used the hand several times and been over exposed to its power from the first experience, apparently if you're inhabited by a spirit for more than 90 seconds, you're in trouble.The sheer implication that anyone would be as stupid as to let the spirit inside you is mind boggling. I know they're teenagers but I can't believe it. Mia just witnessed what's quite clearly a spirit on the first attempt after touching the hand and saying 'Talk to me' and she thinks to go again and then let a spirit possess her...get right out of here with that level of crazy!Nothing about this concept looks fun, getting a buzz from letting dead people inside you is just stupid for me I'm sorry. You're literally playing devils advocate with your life and soul, I'm not religious, but in the context of this film and seeing what's in front of you, why would you be so blasé about your life?You can't play the film off as serious and scary and then let us believe anyone would do any of this, if you can't bring the audience in on the realism of the entire plot device to kick start the film, then I'm sorry, you've severely messed up.Everything was so predictable too, there's no element of suspense throughout, the story hits all the numbers you expect of to, or it did for me at least.Where does the 90 second rule come from, no explanation? I'm aware Duckett (Sunny Johnson) who stabs his brother Cole (Ari McCarthy) before killing himself at the start of the film has suffered at the cost of being over exposed to the embalmed hand or that's at least the implication?Is that where the 90 second rule came from and even if Duckett was over exposed to the hand, how would you know it's 90 seconds that did cost him, and not 87 or 88 seconds etc...you then know that when Mia experiments with it, of course she'll be exposed for more than 90 seconds and suffer the ill effects for the rest of the film.The toe sucking scene for instance was stupidly predictable with it being shown as her doing it. This is followed up by more dumb writing where Daniel (Otis Dhanji) awkwardly explains his viewpoint from that night to Jade, when I think that whole scenario could have been avoided with some outright honesty to Jade. Nothing did happen and it would have appeared less weird if they spoke truthfully about what happened straight away, but the writing needed it to create tension between Mia and Jade but I do think it could have been done without too much awkwardness.Why does the little girl later in the film let Mia in, and none of the spirits prior to this seemingly consider doing the same if they're able to? I'd have thought some benefit may be attained from the spirits being able to do this, trapping the living on the other side maybe without needing to wait 90 seconds, I think there was potential there that was wasted or they should have scrapped that idea as it was too messy to integrate.I don't like the convenient information from Cole that the spirits simply still weaken and leave the bodies after a while. There's no suspense with Riley if he'll just get better, how stupid. Also, why did Cole's brother Duckett do what he did, was that a spirit or was he so damaged from the whole incident?I guess you could make a case that Riley is in hospital and monitored and prevented from successfully killing himself. Even still, how many people has Cole seen that have been over exposed and then managed to not kill themselves so he can be aware of this information?His brother killed himself before he could be freed it seems or again so it appeared, there's a real lack of clarity here. Did someone else tell Cole that information perhaps, which in turn means he wouldn't know if that was actually true or not and with his brothers death, why would he believe that! You see my frustration with the writing here.There were several other instances of poor and predictable writing such as Mia being controlled by a spirit that's so evidently not her mother, and the inevitable stabbing of her father Max with the scissors after he barges into her room to help her.Why didn't Mia kill her dad to be safe in the state she was in and how did he not bleed out anyway, or did we just need him alive for the ending so she can run after him in the hospital for the not so shocking ending...Again, Mia will obviously tell Jade to leave the hospital and Jade will discover Max before Jade then informs her mother Sue (Miranda Otto) about Mia but oh it's too late, surprise, surprise. Mia ends up dead in the middle of the road looking like the kangaroo she left to die in the road earlier, and we randomly see the kangaroo's spirit briefly it seems foreshadowing her death.I get this is about her not moving on and taking responsibility for her actions meaning she's destined to be in limbo forever feeling this same grief, fair enough. I still don't think however the kangaroo works as a form of symbolism in this film, it feels wedged in to be more evocative than what it is because it has to have a deeper meaning than the shell of a script was giving it.Sue's instant blaming of Mia just because she did weed once and her not knowing why Riley did what he did, is over the top for me. Sue knows nothing of the hand fair enough too, and I can appreciate she's grief stricken, but she just goes to flat out blaming her daughters friend before she has any further evidence, even in grief, that's not acceptable.I'd like to add that the police appeared content with whatever happened at the house and there's no real reference to them again. Was Mia's bag searched? Surely the hand might possibly have been confiscated and investigated regardless, I find it too unlikely she'd have smuggled something as random as that out successfully but maybe I can just about accept that, one of the few times I can with this script!The second Sue knows it's not drugs, she then apologies to Mia, but what if Mia did play a part in Riley's downfall that wasn't drug related? I mean that's what did happen, Mia consented to Riley using the hand for 50 seconds and then kept him in longer out of selfishness and an inability to get over her mothers death. I'm not expecting Sue to know that but it's a strange approach to take for her to flat out blame Mia, she almost attaches less blame to her own daughter even though I do appreciate the car scene shows her disappointment with Jade, and Sue needing time to heal.This belief that her son was fine and then he's attempting to rip his eyeballs out and smash his head in, again I find Sue's reaction to simply accept it must just be a 'breakdown' as bizarre. You can mask mental health difficulties but this would be something else entirely, does Sue not question what might have caused the breakdown then if it's not drugs?There was a lot of potential here, but Michael and Danny Philippou haven't succeeded in cultivating a believable and moving story.",2023-07-31
"TALK TO ME (2023) *** Sophie Wilde, Alexandra Jensen, Joe Bird, Otis Dhanji, Miranda Otto, Marcus Johnson, Zoe Terakes, Chris Alosio, Alexandria Steffensen, Ari McCarthy. ""Don't hassle the dead boy; they have eerie powers..."" - Homer Simpson to Bart. Compelling and well-acted supernatural chiller about a grieving teen (an excellent Wilde) who finds herself drawn into a parlor game with her friends involving a ceramic (and cursed) hand which draws its participant into an unearthly bond with its other-worldly hosts which lead to deadly repercussions. Written and directed by Australian sibling team Danny and Michael Philippou mixes pure dread with teen angst in a cocktail blend of THE SIXTH SENSE by way of STIR OF ECHOES with a dash of ""The Twilight Zone""'s Be Careful-What-You-Wish-For ethos masked in the trappings of 'The Monkey's Paw', yet highly original and occasionally hits the right marks of shock and awe. Wilde, who suggest the love-child of Susan Sarandon and Taraji P. Henson, with her saucer-eyes, cowed disposition, and the weight-of-the-world on her shoulders body English is a revelation conveying true poignancy and utter despair in her sudden thrust into an occult-tinged nightmare and familial closure with her departed mother. Crafty practical effects and fantastic make-up designs thanks to Josh Head and Rebecca Buratto (and her team of artists) and Aaron McLisky's spooky cinematography raise the level of expectations tenfold.",2023-08-03
"I went into this excited. What a let down. The acting was subpar at best. A lot of it didnt make sense at all. Characters were extremely unlikeable. This could have been such a good movie. Made by someone else, with a bit more of a twisted mind. This could have easily passed as a pg13 film. Storyline made absolutely no sense. Still a million unanswered questions and the ending was just a horrible as the reat of the film. Just dont waste your time. Newer 'horror' films do not hold a candle to 70s, 80, and 90s horror. Those were absolutely the golden years of the horror genre. What a flop of a good idea that could have been awesome!",2023-09-14
So no background on the hand? Ok. Well the rest of the hour was as fun as a tooth canal. Also when she fell did anyone else see the WHITE stunt double on the ground? What a lame attempt at a movie. I heard it was great but my partner and I couldn't wait for it to end. What a boring pos. I heard it was suppose to be scary well I was amused by when I went to pee and a character said oi. Trash. I honestly was confused who was who the dad getting stabbed was obvious. The ending was actually intriguing if they built up a world where I would care. I don't know what was worse Barbie or this movie. Evil Dead is 100%better than this trash.,2023-08-16
"When we think of Australia, we think of kangaroos, koalas, the Outback, the Sydney Opera House, and English rednecks (as Robin Williams defined the Aussies). But most people probably don't know that there's an entire genre of Australian cinema depicting disturbing things. About ten or so years ago I saw an Aussie neo-noir thriller called ""The Square"", about a tryst that spins out of control. More recently, the land down under gave us ""The Babadook"", about a horrific being that escapes from a child's book.Well, now we have an Aussie movie about demonic possession. This one features some teens who discover that an embalmed hand can enable them to communicate with spirits. Sure enough, the game goes too far, and the terror isn't going away for one girl. ""Talk to Me"" isn't simply a slasher movie; there are graphic scenes of self-harm. Quite the opposite of the pristine image that we have of Australia.This is the sort of movie that the fainthearted should avoid at all costs. But if you're into movies that go all out on the grotesque stuff, then this is the movie for you. I'll be eager to see the next movie from Danny and Michael Philippou.",2023-08-07
"Many American movies have tried very hard to show teens and children are being dumb, mean and dangerous, but none hold a candle to this Aussie flick.The main character is the most disgusting creature I've seen in a while: one of those people who consider themselves good and even righteous, cool and positive, while destroying everything around them. People like these are one of the most terrifying things in the world and that is why Talk to Me was extremely disturbing. And it's not just Mia. Almost all of the teen characters in the film show a level of selfishness and lack of awareness that is more scary than any ghost.Speaking of the ghosts... it's not very clear what they wanted. You get the standard dead corpse evil demon possession, but like so many other movies, they don't explain why they would be like that or what drives them. As mere McGuffins, therefore, they are uninteresting.Bottom line: after watching this film, talking to dead people was the thing least on my mind. Instead I was quickly cataloguing everybody I know, including myself, for signs of Mia-ness. This film was scary for all the wrong reasons.",2023-09-12
"I am a huge horror fan and have no problem watching even a subpar horror film, especially in October.Very rarely does a film come out that I'm legitimately excited for though.With its strong rating, I thought Talk to Me would really give me an experience to remember.As a horror fan I love the thrill of adrenaline from something truly terrifying... or it could be interesting if it has great comedic energy mixed with some sharp jump scares. I don't need to be left with nightmares for it to be enjoyable. Just give me that rush of being caught off guard. This is a subjective point of view, but, to me a scary movie should entertain through thrills over drama... and when they do I am delighted!So maybe if I expected a new experience that would make me giddy with fright I have only myself to blame. Not everyone has my taste.Sometimes a film comes that doesn't meet my standards but is otherwise not technically ""bad"" in the way that really bad horror movies are. This movie isn't cheesy, badly acted, exploitative or any other tired trope of a bad film that takes its self seriously. No glaringly offensive faults but after the first act it does become pretty predictable and poorly paced.Oh, and it's also not very scary. Or fun
It gets bogged down in drama without being engaging. It has lots of disturbing imagery, but doesn't use it to the full effect to shock the audience out of there seats.It begins with so much promise. But just when it's heating up to a climax it loses its vision and relies on a very flimsy and melodramatic plot line to carry it, rather than what it promised: horror.A lot of people enjoyed this film, and good for them.I offer this review to give a counter point to those who expect a real jolt of adrenaline from a good horror film.",2023-10-09
"Honestly, I could not get the hype surrounding this trending Australian horror flick. Despite being hailed as the best horror film of the year, I could not push myself to adore this. It felt like a teen horror whose story went wrong and as deep and complicated as it became. Existential horror films like this get good reviews from film critics for being disturbing and that ""gets under your skin"" factor. For me, the excitement around this film started to wane as soon as the first half ended. That's when it became too deep and philosophical for my taste. But I must commend the original screenplay and the actors' performances.",2023-10-16
"There is a hand that can connect you with the dead, when it takes hold you will be pumped up full of dread, as you envelope round the fingers, digits conjure souls to bring yer, they pass across, and make their way into your head. It's fair to say that this is far from armless fun, if you were there I'm pretty sure you'd make a run, palm-off the grasp to others, to avoid becoming smothered, doing everything you can to snub and shun. But there are those who when encouraged can't resist, who chose to wrestle with the demons at the wrist, like a glory hole for arms, with much regret and many qualms, if nothing else, just hold on tight, and make a fist.",2023-07-30
"I'm assuming all the good reviews are from kids, or adults so starved for fresh horror they'll give anything ""different"" high marks, since the film is definitely marketed for teens.I only watched it due to all the hype. I should've listened to my instinct. This movie is pretty damn awful on every level -- poor acting (bad direction), lame story, nonsensical hip-hop score. I WAS BORED. The only thing 'new' is the conducting of seances with an arm instead of a Ouija board. And the kids are so stupid and obnoxious, I can't tell if it's meant to be serious or satire.I've read the film is supposedly a metaphor for drug addiction, and if it is, that's not even done particularly well. The only interesting scene is the last 5 second ending.",2023-10-01
"What a waste of time. I really was expecting something big from this movie, but then I remember it's an A24 production.The movie has no plot, only random events, there's no characters development, and speaking of it, the main character was so annoying.Like, where did come from the object? Why the chant is ""I let you in""? If you wanna know, you need to talk to the director or writers, cause unfortunatelly you can't obtain these informartions from the movie.There's no use, this movie is corny, sucks for real. Thank God I didn't need to pay tô watch this terrible thing.Don't believe da hype.",2023-09-11
"Trust me. I've watched more than four decades of diverse horror films. The genre is nothing new to me. This is a supernatural horror film about an embalmed hand that is further preserved by encasing it in a ceramic material.Rumor has it that the hand belonged to a psychic and if you held on to the hand and uttered some key words it would make contact with you while you drifted into a trance. While in the trance like state, you would lose total control of your body.This then is the horror element of the film. You try watching films like The Legend Of Hell House(1973), The Changeling(1980), Fear No Evil(1981), Poltergeist(1982) and you see how mediocre this genre has turned over the years...Absolutely the worst casting I have ever seen. The film seems to me catered for a select audience and will not appeal to veteran horror buffs who grew up watching 70's, 80's and 90's horror classics.Nothing to recommend here and also don't expect a gritty climax to a movie made on a shoe-string budget I hear.",2023-09-12
"Ozzie horror gave us the ""Saw"" series. It's appropriate that A24 goes mining for the next Down Under scary guys.Here, it's the Phillipou Brothers.A little like ""Candyman"" this flick is about subtextual trauma. Mia (Sophie Wilde) and her successful father live alone in a house in which Mom had killed herself. This makes Mia hang with her bestie Jade (Alexandra Jensen) along with a tagalong brother Riley.These kids go over to a friends' house to mess with a severed hand which legend had it belong to a person who could speak with the dead (an origin story here would be fun). Things obviously go wrong as Mia starts to see her Mother, who is in the otherworld but yet has some malevolent tendencies towards her and her father.The story takes a melancholic turn about life after death and also touches on death in something like ""Flatliners"" The levels go to absurd when these kids continue to mess with seeing dead people so they can get social media clout.That said, a SOLID creepy flick. The resolution is how you would expect things to go. And, regardless of the violence and the swearing, it's rather odd when it still feels like a Canadian movie though it was made in Australia. Like, everything seems so...kind. Not sure how to explain that. I think the term is ""generic"" This is a better than average horror flick but still, it goes by the numbers which is fine. This is not a slasher film. It is released by A24, let that be your guide.",2023-07-30
"The 2022 horror movie ""Talk to Me"" from writers Danny Philippou, Bill Hinzman and Daley Pearson was one that I hadn't heard about, as I stumbled upon it here in 2023. But I have to admit that I was intrigued by the movie's cover and the synopsis for the movie sounded interesting enough. And the fact that it was a horror movie that I hadn't already seen definitely helped to make me decide to sit down and watch it.The storyline in ""Talk to Me"" was interesting and definitely had a lot of potential to it. And sure, the movie did make for an adequate enough viewing experience, though I feel that the movie was somewhat toned down. It felt like more could have been put into the narrative to make the movie stand out more. It wasn't a scary movie, but I have to say that the storyline and plot proved to be interesting.The acting performances in ""Talk to Me"" were good. I wasn't familiar with the cast ensemble in the movie, but the actors and actresses put on good performances and helped carry the movie nicely. And thus made it all the more watchable and enjoyable.Visually then I will say that ""Talk to Me"" was good. The special effects and make-up was good, and that certainly added something enjoyable to the overall impression of the movie.All in all, a watchable horror movie. But it just wasn't outstanding or overly memorable. But suitable for a single viewing if you enjoy horror movies. The ending of the movie, however, was rather cliché and you saw it coming a mile away. A shame, because that ending sort of felt like a slap in the face after having sat through 95 minutes.My rating of directors Danny Philippou and Michael Philippou's 2022 movie ""Talk to Me"" lands on a five out of ten stars.",2023-09-17

"It is a film without depth, without development, where almost everything is resolved without meaning.3The protagonists make the most absurd decisions, they contradict each other every 5 minutes. And the ghosts don't fit too much into the main story.The ending is too abrupt. Such a flat script that focuses on 2 characters.The rest of the characters follow such a flat script that they become a nuisance.I think a sequel in this same incoherent style will be a big mistake.The plaster hand fails to capture attention: since the drama and inconsistencies of the film do not allow a good development.",2023-08-16
"""Talk to Me"" is a debut from the Phillipou brothers under A24 that takes the oft-visited possession horror subgenre into some new territory whilst setting and consistently maintaining an eerie and disturbing tone. The depiction of modern Australian teenage culture felt a bit too ""down with the kids"" and drawn out at times, but generally came across well with its application of slang and contemporary cultural references that very much brought the setting into the present day. There is a blend of psychological horror, jump scares, shock horror, and gore. Meaning most dimensions of human fear are attended to, creating a robust horror ensemble. The only problem is it doesn't entirely sustain these strengths into its second half. You could say it had me in the first half.Subtle use of sound and camera work felt very much borrowed from the same vein as ""Hereditary"" which is never a bad thing. Downright bizarre and inconceivable scenes regularly caught the audience off-guard and an unforgiving atmosphere of the unexpected and uneasy meant nothing felt ""off the table"". Characters setting a sense of control and predictability were soon overturned in horrifying fashion.As said before, about halfway through the film the novelty of the ""hand"" concept wore thin, and the film ran out of momentum. This was later redeemed with a great, thought-provoking ending that leads the viewer's imagination beyond the film. You could call this, in some sense, the ""Inception"" of horror films; once you watch it you'll understand why it could be described as such.7.5/10.",2023-08-02
"IMDB reviews aren't really my thing, but after attending Talk to Me at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival, I had to come on here and sing it praise. Every year there are a few horror movies that are discovered that set the genre ablaze with excitement, 2023 is no exception. Talk to Me is masterfully layered with suspense, mystery, and high-octane horror, but this isn't your standard possession film, and thank god for that. Without delving into spoiler territory, this film also grapples with the loss of a loved one, the impact it can have on our psyche, and what lengths a person would go to silence their pain. In their directorial debut the Philippou brothers extend a hand to the viewer for an incredible ride.",2023-01-23
"Next time, a fist bump will do.Whomever denies we're living in the greatest period of Horror Movies has simply been in a coma for the past decade. This year alone, we've had some incredible horrors such as No One Will Save You, Totally Killer, Saw X and probably the #1 of 2023, Talk to Me. Just to name a few and I haven't even seen them all yet.This is a GREAT throwback to the 80s horror without at all being an homage. THAT was refreshing as homages have become too overused lately. Especially just for the sake of being an homage. Plus, it's rare to see something THIS modern. And this RAW.Talk to Me involves some delinquent to disturbed to disgusting teens/kids who stumbled upon this Ouija-Type device to connect to the other side. Oh, but they're ""smart"" about it and only allowing the connection to last for a small amount of time. Whelp, their dance with the devil is going to be killer and they may never come back.I don't personally believe in the supernatural and yet, this felt completely real. Meaning, IF this were to happen, I truly believe these actions, reactions and disconnected/ deteriorating relationships probably would play out like this. And while I normally desire my horror movies to be right at 90 minutes, as this one was, I could've seen a little more here. There was so much emotion and threads to unravel and explore. Helps I DO love Australian horror films, so they can be as long as they need to be.And as highly as I recommend this film and it may be my favorite horror of 2023, I will say, the third act is exactly how I expected it'd play out. A lot of the great horror of the past decade have endings that truly shocked me and as extremely grim and bleak as they are, they impressed me for going there. Sadly, there weren't too many surprises here.Still, I did like the ending, and especially the very ending. Just, please. No sequel.***Final Thoughts: It's a great time to not be a kid.

Not a single likeable character so I couldn't care less what happens to any of them.This movie has had a massive build up and clearly lots of fake reviews.How Miranda Otto decided to be in this I will never understand because she is the only actually talented person in this disaster and in this she also was terrible.Dismissed.,2023-09-15
"I just got out of a pre-screening event for ""Talk to Me,"" and a lady who said she was a rep for the studios and was taking notes to send to the studios and the directors ( Danny Philippou, Michael Philippou ). I was asked my thoughts and I'll share my thoughts as I said them to her: I am happy this isn't pretentious and that the average movie-goer will like it.Needless to say, she wasn't thrilled with my response and went to another person.A24 has built a brand for themselves over the years as being snooty, know-more-than-you and movies that are either too artsy for horror fans or too horror for artsy fans. Personally, I love their brand and welcome all their movies with open arms.""Talk to Me,"" is neither scary nor artsy. It's about as far out there as a ""Nightmare on Elm st."" sequel and hits all the marks: Just enough blood and make up to satisfy the horror hounds and has a likeable story line so everyone can watch this movie and not feel insulted.Mia, played by a phoning-it-in Sophie Wilde, just lost her mother and she spends her time with her best friends family: Jade (Alexandra Jensen); her brother, Riley (Joe Bird) and mom, Sue (Miranda Otto).Hayley (Zoe Terakes) and their friend Joss (Chris Alosio) throw parties where guests shake hands with a supposed real hand of a medium or satanist (both ideas are pitched, but who cares) say ""Talk to Me"" and viola! You got spirits!Do we really care about the rest of the plot? Not really. And, that's the problem: There really isn't much more of a plot. There is a side story about Mia's dead mother using the hand in order to speak with Mia and Riley, becoming severely injured, but, none of it's really entertaining.Are the spirits lying to Mia in order to get a sacrifice to come to our world? Are the spirits using Mia to do their evil bidding? Yes and no, but: you don't care.A24 served up a bland, no brains horror flick with nice blood and was a step outside their realm. There's no cool shots, there's not a lot to think about but there is a lot of music and score, which was different.Go into ""Talk to Me"" expecting nothing and you'll walk out happy.",2023-07-20

"Still mourning the loss of her mother, Mia (Sophie Wilde) has grown emotionally distant from her father, Max (Marcus Johnson), and begun spending more time with her best friend Jade (Alexandra Jensen) and her younger brother Riley (Joe Bird). After attending a party with Jade and Daniel (Otis Dhanji), Mia's former boyfriend who's now dating Jade, the two are introduced to an embalmed hand relic by Hayley (Zoe Terakes) and Joss (Chris Alosio) that allows the holder to talk to the dead and allow them to be ""allegedly"" safely possessed by up to 90 seconds. What initially starts as a party gimmick soon turns serious when Mia thinks the hand is a bridge to her dead mother and sends her on a slow descent.Talk to Me is the feature debut of twin Aussie Youtubers Danny and Michael Philippou who came to prominence with their channel RackaRacka which is known for horror comedy videos. The film is a fully Australian production which the brothers worked on with noted producer Samnatha Jennings who previously produced the breakout and influential horror film The Babadook. The movie has become a sleeper hit earning $88 million worldwide at the time of this writing against its $4.5 million budget as well as scoring substantial acclaim. Talk to Me is a promising debut from the Philippou's and shows them to be talent to keep an eye on.While on a surface level the film would seem to be your average teen oriented horror film centered around a ""cursed object"" (Well-traveled ground seen in the likes of Polaroid, Wish Upon, and even this year's All Fun and Games) but despite sporting a familiar horror template, what it does with that template is anything but ordinary. At its core, Talk to Me is a character piece about addictive tendencies and unprocessed grief with Sophie Wilde's well-played as someone who's very much withdrawn from her family and extended social life and retreated to a state where she's in a state of limbo using her friend Jade and her family as a surrogate family while doing what she can to avoid the broken remains of her own. Despite Mia not being the most likable or sympathetic of characters, the movie doesn't ask us to like Mia and instead wants us to understand what motivates her and there is underlying humanity to her such as the ""cool older sister"" dynamic she has with Riley that shows a more tender side if not one to necessarily be approved of. I really like how the filmmakers handle the plot point of the embalmed hand because while they do establish a set of rules in how it works, they purposefully leave its origins vague which is really to its benefit as that makes its presence more unnerving. The Philippou do an interesting job of showcasing the hand's effects as we not only see them from the point of view of the user, but also from the point of view of outside observers. Despite being a horror film, there are also some points of comedy and satire that do work such as Jade's mother Sue always inquiring about whether drugs or parties are happening under her nose as well as the glib way the primarily teenaged characters are treating the notion of possession and contact with the afterlife as something to post on social media for bravado or bragging rights.I really enjoyed Talk to Me and it's one of the better cursed object horror I've seen in quite some time. The Philippou Brothers do a solid job of bringing this premise to life and Sophie Wilde is fantastic as Mia and I really look forward to seeing what the Philippous do next.",2023-10-11
"This movie was horrible. The start was interesting but the rest was confusing, borderline stupid, and just boring. Honestly i wanted to walk out the theatre in the middle of the movie. I was so excited to see this movie. I read some great reviews and it seemed original, but I was let down. The premise of the story could be great, but they missed so many opportunities. The main character annoyed me and clearly made some of the dumbest decisions ever. It was almost like the ""hand"" was an extra in this movie, when it should have been the main character. They literally tell you nothing about it - we should have known EVERYTHING about it. Not a complete waste of time, but don't get your hopes up!",2023-10-28
"Talk to Me fits right along with the recent trend of moralizing horror like Hereditary, The Babadook, and Relic. The issue I had with this film (and Hereditary) is the inability of the storytellers to choose whether they want to talk about grief or scare you. The film looks good is pretty much all I can give it and the preformers are certainly committed. The film fails to emotionally mine the grief of Riley in any meaningful way. It also didnt scare me. The more I think about it this just feels like a padded out evil dead with none of the scares and humor. What makes The Evil Dead so perfect is that it knows what it wants to be. The characters aren't fleshed out, and they don't have to be. The effect ends up being you put yourself in Ash's shoes and then begin to realize how horrible the situation truly is. It wasn't trying to explore trauma and tie it up with a neat bow.",2023-08-13
"I was really looking forward to see Talk To Me, as people were calling it the scariest and most unique horror film of the year. Did I see a different movie?I'm really surprised by the other reviews. This movie was so generic. There's nothing unique about it and it's full of plot holes. It has some of the most unlikeable characters I have ever seen in a film. The ending is also really dumb. And oh god, that cringey montage with the rap song and the KSI cameo. This movie was clearly designed to cater to teenagers.The gore is quite impressive, I admit that. The opening is also really strong. Too bad the whole movie goes downhill after that. 5/10.",2023-08-02
"This movie really delivered. It has a certain Hereditary Vibe and at the same time came across with some fresh ideas and, for me, the most important aspect: a coherent atmosphere. Dang this movie triggered so many emotions and had great acting, great characters and so many good ideas. And I dont know how high the budget was, but it felt very big and i am sure it wasnt. There are so many creative ideas to raise the feeling of seeing a big budget movie but there was no time thinking about that while watching it. Can not wait to see how it does when it goes public.

"Some teenagers/young adults are partying and bring out a supernatural hand to play with. The hand puts them in touch with something supernatural, possible evil. As long as they don't stay too long with it everything is fine and it's a teenage thrill. They enjoy the daring and wild ride. However then things go too far.This is the best horror I have seen this year. Compared to. Evil Dead Rise and The Boogeyman this is much better. Sure they have jump scares and nasty things happen but you're not a invested in as much as you are in Talk To Me. It revolves around Sophie Wilde and she keeps your attention all the way through. You really want to know what happens, is anyone going to die? And can they get rid of the evil?The loud music as times also helps. I did think it was a bit slow getting going but it is worth the wait. I was tempted to give it an 8 but shied away from that. I would give it a 7.5 if I could.",2023-07-24
"A group of teens get too involved with the boogeyman again. Good photography and some telegraphed scenes of self mutilation get this to stand out a little more then a movie made on a beer budget about a group of teens being chased by a demon through the woods. There is the premise: By clutching the plastered hand of some long dead spiritualist, you will be greeted to some of those special visions usually only privy to back-ward habitués. It's fun and games for the teens, in much the same way that the marketing of Salvia Divinorum, before its demonization into illegality, became a YouTube fad: make your unsuspecting friend insanely crazy for a few minutes. Now, that drug really was some nasty evil stuff, a lot nastier then this flick. And of course this severed hand thing (Monkey's paw, Angel Heart, The Hand, The Adam's family) party amusement gets out of hand when the summoned spirits reveal their agenda. Does this sound a little familiar? Have we seen this countless times? Still, who even looks for originality anymore? Like gasoline or dope or whatever, if it does the job that's good enough I guess. This one doesn't do the job. A few jump scares, a few heavily milked body-horror, self mutilation shots, and a clump of thrill seeking kiddies getting their comeuppance, a sort or right of passage into adulthood, the awful place where you realize irresponsible stunts can have ugly consequences. And yes there is an angry mother trying to keep a lid on her wayward daughter's enthusiasms. We are supposed to root for the children though, which means that's the target audience. This is rated Sigh, Oh Well.........",2023-10-06
"When a group of kids get together under the thumb of the rather odious ""Hayley"" (Zoe Terakes) they are presented with a ceramic hand - that apparently encases a real one - that acts as a portal to a dimension in which live the dead. They have discovered that no harm can be done if they stick to a time limit, exceed that - and well they are in virgin and potentially perilous territory. Following on from her best friend ""Jade"" (Alexandra Jensen) who has a go, it falls to ""Mia"" (Sophie Wilde) and after the most bizarre of personally traumatic connections, she is soon addicted to the experience and is also soon providing a conduit that is causing havoc within their group - not least for poor young ""Riley"" (Joe Bird) who ends up needing danger money - and a soft play area! Wilde does quite well here and though the rest of the acting isn't really up to much, the story has an originality to it that genuinely creates a new avenue for a genre that has been really suffering from same old, same old storytelling of late. Bird is by far the star here - even if he is incapacitated for much of it, and the aforementioned Terakes creates a character I'd cheerfully throttle. There's too much dialogue and it's very very score-heavy which did annoy after a while, but it's at times quite scary and definitely worth a watch around Halloween on the telly.",2023-08-06
"I don't understand how anyone enjoyed this or thought it was scary. It was such a dumb movie with horrible characters. Absolute garbage. Utter drivel. Completely ridiculous premise, characters willingly doing something that no one in their right minds would do, dreadful characters. The list could go on. Really, do not bother. It seems to be aimed at. Well,I don't really know who it's aimed at. It had is creepy parts but it didn't come off to me as a terrifying film. It must be from being a big time horror fan, not much can scare me. I guess it would scare someone who hasn't seen horror films regularly. Doesn't mean it wasn't a good film. It just wasn't a big hype to me and there were several plot holes.",2023-10-28
"There is no time wasted with this one. Right out of the gate it hurls you into the action, engaging and shocking you right off the bat. It holds fast to that engagement throughout the experience and every time it felt like the pacing was starting to slow down they picked it right back up with a bang.It is few and far between now a days to come across something that feels original and fresh, especially in the vein of possession. Talk to Me managed to do just that. The concept was truly intriguing and the execution was captivating. Something about the way they manifested the possession in this was so gnarly and frightening... it was very effective and well done.What was also well done was the makeup and sfx. With the visceral nature of what was represented, the film would not have been as successful if it wasn't for the artists so masterfully exemplifying their craft in this (talk about gnarly...).The spook factor is real in this one and did not come to play. The way they made this so relatable and accessible to their audience in this down to earth way makes it even creepier. There is a fun and creepy montage I enjoyed with a very intense, awesome scene following it that is still taking up space in my mind.The acting was also excellent across the board and a big attribute of this movie's success. The main girl did and excellent job and I hope to see more from her. The dad wasn't great for me and the moms character was a little jarring and odd to me in vernacular and behavior but I'm going to chalk it up to a cultural disconnect.I do feel like the story was missing a little background and eventually a bit of closure. I wish we had gotten more on the hand, where it came from and its purpose. More about the other realm, the spirits it holds and whatever entity they so casually mentioned can essentially impersonate other people? It wasn't terribly lacking, I would've just enjoyed more. I also would have liked just a little more closure as far as the storyline went. I certainly don't need everything wrapped up in a pretty black bow, but it almost gave that feeling of setting itself up for a sequel. Which I would love to see but it should also be solid as a stand alone. Regardless, I still enjoyed the ending which is where so many horror movies fall short. It was foreseeable yet I was not expecting it and appreciated that.All in all Talk to Me is a classic possession/communing with spirits story with a fresh, innovative twist to it and a masterful execution from all involved that will satiate the deep dark thralls of horror and thrills we so enjoy. Would recommend.IG- Howlingatthemoonreviews.",2023-07-28
"Greeting from the other side. This has been done before, and done better, such as Ouija. Not that Ouija was a great film, but it was done better than this mess.The ceramic, cursed hand puts a unique spin on this type of horror movie, but they don't do much with it. It's like they had the hand idea, but didn't know what to do beyond that. There was WAY too much filler in this movie. The movie is 1 hour and 35 minutes long, and they could have cut an hour from it.Another big problem with this movie is the annoying teenage cast. They aren't likeable, in fact, I hated all of them. I just didn't believe that they would sit around partying, laughing, and filming their friends as they play with a cursed hand. I don't care how many times or how many people played with that thing and survived, this item would NEVER become a joke like they were treating it. Yeah, it's totally funny when your friend becomes possessed by Lord knows what, and it causes them to choke or do nasty things against their will. They film it and laugh as their friend flirts with death. Not likely.They wasted an interesting idea. They should have kept showing the various ghosts, demons, or whatever was summoned. They were creepy, and it would have helped the movie.They also should have used adults instead of bratty, annoying teens. This would have given the film a more serious vibe, and thus creepier.There was WAY to much filler in this movie. More time with the script was needed. It was never really explained what these creatures were, or how they were tied to the ceramic hand. Also, the hand itself wasn't explained either. The writers could have explored these things to lengthen the film, rather than the useless filler scenes used.Anyway, this movie is worth watching once, but have your finger on the ""skip ahead 1 minute"" button, or whatever you have on your remote. You will be using it quite often because of the filler scenes I mentioned earlier.",2023-10-12
"I just watched a low budget Aussie movie that made it all the way to the US Sundance Film Festival in the Egyptian Theatre...not a bad feat for twins from OZ.This 94 minute Horror, Thriller, Supernatural First Feature Film for the RackaRacka brothers, Danny & Michael Phillipou was a true family affair, even roping in their sister Helene as a possessed person in the online videos.Before making this debut movie they already had over 1.5 billion views and 6.5 million subscribers on YouTube and other social media channels for their crazy ""Jackass"" style videos they've been making since they were children...sometime featuring a facsimile of Ronald McDonald.The young acting talent in front of the camera includes Sophie Wilde.She has proven herself as a leading actress (""The Portable Door"") to carry this movie on her tiny shoulders as ""Mia"" because she is in nearly every scene and makes a brilliant transition from beginning to ending.Zoe Terakes (""Wentworth"", ""Nine Perfect Strangers"") as ""Hayley"" starts the whole ball rolling by gathering all her friends to a seance with a difference.Her friend (Chris Alosio) as ""Joss"" constantly carries with him the creepy hand in his back pack...no snacks or drinks just a mummified hand and candle kit.In this supernatural experience each person must hold the embalmed and plastered hand of a dead spiritualist and literally talk to the hand as they utter the words ""Talk To Me"" then invite the spirit they raise into them to be possessed for no more than 90 seconds.A candle is lit at the beginning of the deadly ceremony and blown out at the end to conclude the session, if not the dead remain on our side.It's a spooky premise that's not entirely original, but it works surprisingly well.The horror and jump scares will keep you awake and maybe even give you nightmares.The on screen violence will force you to navel gaze momentarily to avoid the ugliness on more than one occasion.Youngest actor on set Joe Bird as ""Riley"" plays in a coma for most of the movie.Alexandra Jensen as ""Jade"" plays his big sister.Miranda Otto, from an Aussie acting dynasty, is their mother, ""Sue"".The director's produced ""Talk To Me"" themselves by securing investors who believed in them and the project rather than letting the story get lost in the Hollywood grist mill.This meant fighting to keep Aussie actors, accents, shooting in Adelaide, South Australia and more without diluting the product and something getting lost in translation as so often happens.It was a gamble that cost them dearly, but paid off in the end after Sundance, because big production companies were crawling over themselves to get the brothers to sign on the dotted line for distribution deals.A24 won out in the end over other major players to wet the ink and put ""Talk To Me"" into 2000 screens in the US alone!""Talk To Me"" is one of the most successful debut feature horror films since ""Saw"" for our other famous Aussie horror exports James Wan & Leigh Wanell.It's also way better than anything they've created lately.It's got a distinctly Jordan Peele (""Get Out"", ""Nope"")vibe in its cinematography and I say that in a good way.This movie even caught his attention.The opening scene will shock you to your core.There is no turning back once you've seen ""Talk To Me"".It reminded me of ""The Babadook"" with good reason...Causeway Films' producers also collaborated on ""Talk To Me"".Warning: Do not try this at home kids.I""Talk To Me"" has got a fight on its hands (pardon the pun) during this period known jokingly as Barbenheimer.Thanks to the success of both ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" putting up the full house signs, but if you wanna see something scary this should satisfy that hunger.Content creators are now making feature movies...enjoy this unsettling, urban legend with a cautionary tale & allegory to drug abuse.",2023-07-28
"Its an overall good movie especially considering it is the first feature film attempt by the directors. But is far from perfect. The biggest (& possibly the only) flaw of the movie is its protaganist. She does not miss a single chance to act stupid & selfish and keeps getting everyone else into trouble. This makes watching the movie a frustrating experience at times. If there was a proper sensible character to counter her and was given as much screen time, movie would have been better. But on technical level, its a well made movie with nice effects, cinematography, acting & direction. In the end, if I was to rank this movie in comparison to other horror movies. I would rank it above any conjuring or insedious sequels but below movies like 'It Follows'.",2023-09-13
"I have been anxiously awaiting this film's release since originally seeing the trailer, so when offered a free pre-screener, I jumped at the opportunity! The theater was packed with horror fans and you could feel the excitement in the air. However, after a strong opening sequence, that excitement soon dissipated.Let's keep this short and sweet. While the scares were great, they were few and far between. For the most part, I liked the cast and their performances but I wanted more from the story. I got bored. With a total running time of 1 hour and 34 minutes, there's truly only about 10-15 minutes that are actually scary and/or exciting. I'm a huge A24 fan, but this was NOT it, y'all!",2023-07-23
"It had an original idea that I had never seen before and thought was intriguing. The hand thing was very cool and unique. And for a small budget movie they did well on there special affects. It was decent. Once possessed it was convincing but I'll give that credit to the actors for doing there jobs.As a one time watch it's OK, but I won't be able to watch it again. For me, it's the decisions. I could not truly enjoy once we got to attempts at resolving the possession issue. Perhaps it was using youths and attempting to predict actual decisions but when a family member or a good friend is in danger you do what you can. And that wasn't done here. And the how Riley made it out alive it confuses me even more.I knew Mia's end at the beginning. So perhaps that affected my perception. However, I felt it was one bad decision after another.",2023-09-27
"The director insults the intelligence of the viewer. We know that this movie is scary, but the element of imagination is very basic. It seemed that more noise was used to make it look scary than scary elements. You notice that the actors forget their mistakes in a very childish way and repeat them again. The script was very lame. Throughout the movie, you are looking for something special to surprise you, but it doesn't happen, and you are faced with repetitive and very weak scenes. The movie was not only not entertaining but also very boring and basic. I was not expecting a very special movie, but this movie was very boring.",2023-09-10
"Hello again please read this review and save yourself the HUGE let down I experienced in watching this LAME film. Once again I am totally dumbstruck by what people today call 'scary'. This film didn't even give me chills ONCE! I love all great horror from the original night of the living dead to the conjuring movies(1 & 2 at least). This film doesn't just fail at being a decent horror movie but it completely fails outright as a basic film! Firstly the characters are TERRIBLE! They all have ZERO likability and just keep on making DUMB choices throughout! The script itself seems like it was written by a 10 year old with cringey humour and just outright bad dialogue with zero logic! The story is all over the place trying to find an actual point to justify its existence. The film is so dull I actually started writing this review an hour into it and just let it continue to give me ammo to hate it! If I'm coming across a bit angry it's because I LOVE HORROR movies and I HATE keep getting my hopes up about the new films everyone raves are the ""best new horror film"" and then I am left scratching my head wondering what the heck was supposed to be good about them! Seriously there is literally nothing to like about this film, the complete lack of story, the complete lack of likeable characters, the COMPLETE LACK of scares??!! I just wish people who knew nothing about decent horror would STOP making these lame films! Seriously are we supposed to be scared about rotting dead people? Is that what the point is and that's why I don't get it? Even when the film starts to make you think it has a point(saving a child who's been possessed) it then completely forgets this and ends in a really stupid illogical way! Ok I'm gunna stop now and hope my high blood pressure has proven to you TRUE horror fans out there to pass this one by, honestly any TRUE horror fan will only enjoy how easy this film is to scoff at. A friend once said to me, ""usually when all the critics and mainstream fans rave about a new film stating ""the best new 'genre' film yet!"" it is usually a BAD sign, and oh boy is this lame film ""the worst new horror film yet!"". I SO WANTED TO LOVE THIS FILM but honestly, there is nothing to love or even remotely like about any of it. The only thing I am actually HAPPY about......I didnt have to pay to watch it thankfully and now will also be cancelling my preordered steelbook because once again I fell for the clearly bought for hype for this boring snooze fest. I will say I can't wait to hear what my mate thinks of it as he like myself is proper horror fan and again like myself he is stupidly excited to see ""the new best horror movie!"" Lol! Thanks for listening to me rant and I pray it saves you all an hour and a half of your life you will never get back! So until the next time Stay safe and may the force be with you.",2023-09-29
"Very cool premise. Original. That's rare. I appreciate that. But the movie itself was painful to get through. Hated every single character. Not one of them was reasonable for one second. Not one of them was anything but cruel to anyone else, eliminating any possible reason to care about what happened to any of them. After barely making it far enough to get to the point where things pick up, it was unfortunately very easy to tell how literally every scene would play out from then on. Just pulling teeth and waiting for the foregone conclusion. The personal loss being the motivation for doing all that bad stuff was tired and expected. I was skipping ten seconds ahead at a time towards the end because I needed it to be over. Nice premise obliterated by below average writing, bargain bin characterization, and zero reason to get invested in anyone's fate. Stick to directing, boys. Leave the writing to the writers.",2023-10-07
"""Talk to Me"" is a truly terrifying and remarkable debut from the RackaRacka twins. A twisted story told with amazing skill.The good in this movie by far is the practical effects. They are absolutely terrifying to look at and immensely detailed. It's very disturbing and quite disgusting. Along with that is amazing gore. Again it's very disturbing and isn't fun. The performances are also very good. Sophie Wilde in particular is an absolute powerhouse here along with all the other cast members. The writing too is very good. Some of the best writing I've seen in a horror film in years. That immensely helps with making nearly every character here either likable or interesting. The idea of grief in this film is not only perfectly written, but is written in such a way that truly brings everything in the story to full circle. I love the subtle idea that this film in a way is an allegory for substance abuse for young teens. It gives the audience something to think about admits the bloodshed. Along with that we get some great directing with some amazing cinematography. The scares aren't jump scares, they're tense shots that linger for far too long to leave the audience in absolute shock. And finally the ending is just...it's an absolutely amazing ending that really sticks the landing along with everything else this movie achieved so well.All in all, ""Talk to Me"" is one of the rare horror movies that truly disturbed me and really showcases a great directing talent with these two twins.",2023-07-27
"Finally, an excellent and fresh horror flick. And it comes from Australia, like one of the best shows ever: Mr Inbetween. It looks like that Australian people know how to scare people creating a simple story, but original, full of real horror, and a great conclusion.First, acting here is great. I didn't know anything about any of the cast but they do a great job. Not the usual for horror.Second, I love the original idea and the execution. Not the usual and not necessary abuse of CGI. The whole think is great, including a surprising ending.Last, I really enjoyed the whole experience. I am a big horror fan, and finally I can recommend this movie to everyone who loves real horror. Enjoy.",2023-08-30
"Intelligent horror. For once there's a horror movie with character development and a scenario they're out in that gets the audience invested in. Not since the first Elm Street movie was there ever an intelligent story about fear and loss. The movie examines the curiosity of what's on the other side of this life. Yes, it's also creepy, haunting, and with enough jump scares for the feeble folks.The movie opens dark and ends in a way that may stay with you for a while. I found it to be an intelligent movie that examines life and death. The monster is the fear itself of what lies in the other side. While it's difficult to delve into details and no spoilers here, let's just say horror movie fans will get their fill. It's scary but also a story about loss.",2023-07-27
"I had someone literally barrage me in text form about this movie, telling me how it's the most perfect film, how it has kept them up late at night and that they can't shake it. I feel badly because I hate that I knew that I'd instantly judge this movie as a result and that I didn't see the version of this movie that they did.What I did see was fine - and let me make fun of myself, if it were shot on video in 1983 or was made by an Italian special effects artist in 1985 then distributed by Filmirage, I would have probably loved it a lot more, such is my madness - but at no moment did I lose a moment's rest. That said, it does have some wild eye-related destruction and no small amount of gore. But it owes so much of itself to a computer-guided camera move that will seem as quaint as morphing in a few years. Directed by Danny and Michael Philippou (Danny also wrote the script with Daley Pearson and Bill Hinzman and no, that isn't the maker of Flesheater no matter how much I want it to be), it revolves around a severed hand that allows people to see visions. The kids think it's like drugs; as you can imagine, none of them have watched as many possession and occult movies as you or I, so they open the door to something horrible, as you do.Mia (Sophie Wilde) is struggling with the death of her mother after an overdose and her father Max doesn't help because he's never been there and he's since grown more distant. One night, she and her friend Jade (Alexandra Jensen) and Jade's little brother Riley (Joe Bird) sneak out to a party hosted by Hayley (Zoe Terakes) and Joss (Chris Alosio). There, Mia holds the hand - ninety seconds only is the rule - and is shocked by the way that it makes her feel. Yeah, it's like drugs. And you want more once you taste it.The next night, they are joined by even more people and Jade refuses to allow the younger James and her brother Riley to try the hand. Mia, however, lets them use it when Jade leaves and Riley is possessed by Mia's mother, trying to apologize to her. She disregards the time limit, which causes Riley to become overtaken and repeatedly slams his face into everything around himself, becoming so suicidal that he becomes a burden on his family, only able to survive in a coma.Mia has taken the hand and keeps using it, discovering that Riley is in limbo being tortured, but she still needs to talk to her mother, even if the spirits begin to destroy her grasp on reality. Twist ending to wrap it all up and there you go.Samantha Jennings, one of the co-founders of production company Causeway Films, produced this. She also was behind The Babadook, another movie that people tell me that I'd love. They were worse than right. Oh baby, they were wrong (sorry, I tried the hand and got possessed by the demonic form of Robert Evans).There's also a sequel - Talk 2 Me - and a prequel that is all on social media and screens coming out. Like all modern horror, this feels like a way of dealing with grief and that's fine. I'm sure for some this really worked and like I said, I wish I could enjoy it without realizing everything several beats ahead. But hey, more movies like this and maybe I'll finally see something like Hereditary as a good film.",2023-09-25
"LIKES:The Pace/time of the movie
-It's dark material and it has a lot of thought, so a compact time limit helps weather the dark storm for this reviewer.-Talk to me takes the gas and give it all with the right momentum to keep things interesting, but never dipping into the too heavy a territory to get boring or typical.-And keeping that pace helps to blunt some of the elevated thoughts that A24 sometimes gets stuck with.The Film Filters:
-A horror movie is only as good as the feeling it establishes, and in this case Talk To Me is a winner.-The film is shot in this grey filter, dreary, depressing, and haunting that works perfectly with the material they are presenting.-It helps add this ambience of the looming horror, but also contributes to the psych issues that come with it as well, really amplifying the true scare facto of this movie.-And then taking into account the cinematography, the movie just hits all the right shots to sell the story and leave you with a sense of unease when it is all done.The Makeup/Visuals:
-A good movie requires good support of costumes and makeup to make the creatures come out and memorable.-The spirits of this world are horrifying. Maybe not to the traditional Insidious like demons and maladies, but this one takes the realism and really conveys the gross state of decay that these beings are in.-Certain moments really convey that horrible mode, and I can't help but appreciate the nightmare inducing images that these ghosts are. A true A24 vision brought to life.-But even the injuries that occur have this authenticity to it, and the seizure modes are animalistic and unnatural that are realistic to a level beyond our understanding.Acting:
-It's not the best performance or most unique, but damn can these young actors act.-Talk to me takes the teenager spirit and takes it to a level that was relevant, deeper, and yet the typical fodder you find in these movies.-I won't mention most of the first billed, because their part in this movie is limited, but they play the parts well and convey the message of this story.-Sophie Wilde is the lead I'll talk about. The Australian actress has her niche in the horror world, and does it so good. She's got a vulnerability that works well, but this attitude that helps balance it, leading to an impressive character to follow.Alexandra Jensen as the best friend is that role that I thought was going to annoy me, but really meshes well with the drama aspect and handles the stupidity of the others quite well.Joe Bird is talented if not a bit quite, but once the movie gets started, the potential for some very powerful roles come out, alongside a manner that gives him range for potential roles.-The cast works together so well, and this frightened band of teenagers gives you some hopes, but some concern as they continue to solve the mystery at hand.The Story:
-It's predictable at times, but the unique aspect of the Monkey's paw so to speak works as a medium that really helps ground, but mesh the two well.-Talk to Me uses this simplistic device to elevate, and by having such a closed portal keeps the film's antagonist delivering, while also helping hit other parts of the movie quite well.-Outside of the usual specters of ghost stories, this movie does the internal antagonism well, a constant battle of struggling to determine what is going on with them.-Add some touching moments, a little character struggle, and some actual realistic approaches and mix it with the haunting element, and again you have a victory for me in this department.-The movie really makes this ghost story feel terrifying to that degree, not so much in the jumping and scaring tactics, but more so in the unsettling ease that that goes with it.The Ending:
-I won't spoil anything, but Talk to Me is one of those that does an elevated horror ending quite well at least in terms of some balance.-One level it's a metaphor with great use of theatrical elements. A piece that holds so many levels of moral battling that it leave it a bit ambiguous as to what will happen up until the decision.-Then you get the story elements and the symbology that it serves, not so lost in the art to be open ended and super vague to give you closure, and a closure that leave an imprint in your mind.-It all comes down to being a fitting ending and I like that in a movie that can handle art and storytelling and find middle ground, which I felt it did.Dislikes:Predictable:
-I had most of the movie down pretty quickly, so I anticipate others might be able to figure out where the movie is going.-A few twists help try to throw you aside, but I found that most of the foreshadowing in the first thirty minutes should give you enough to determine the ending.Perhaps a Bit Too Dark?-A24 should have a warning for most of its films in that the darkness may be too much for many people, including parts of myself.-One part is the sheer horror and realism, with vibes that go down perhaps too personal of levels, so caution if you are prone to PTSD with realistic events.-Second, A24's desire to put people in the nude that aren't the most stunning is still prevalent and that did little for me other than stir my nausea.-Third the movie has one moment that makes no sense until the end, but there was so much better use than once more sowing me an animal needlessly suffering. Dragging it out, adding little use, there were better ways to accomplish it.-And crossing my rules of boundaries, I don't enjoy that, so it loses points for me.More character development:
-Simply put, the movie starts off well, but the other characters could have worked better to help the others. Maybe add a little more attempts to discern the mental quality and finish polishing things up.-Great characters could have been more, but then that would have taken more time and more time dwelling in the dark might not have been good given how this movie might leave people feeling.The VERDICT:
Talk to me is a weird movie, but it lives to the usual caliber of A24 in elevating a movie series to a new level to help add freshness to the movie. Or something like that. The movie works in establishing creepy feelings, horror that sticks with you and a story that will certainly remain ingrained in the mind. It takes the familiar genre and helps condense the horrors to a logical plot, while exploring character traits that help mix up things while still feeling familiar. With a talented cast, characters who are a tad more developed, and elements that blend together to be a real horror movie, it certainly does stick out as one of the more unique and disturbing horror movies of the bunch. However, more time with the characters, a little more mystery and involvement to help mix things up, ad toning back some of the more disturbing elements could have helped this movie more to really be the wow factor they were shooting with this movie. Thus, my review leaves a score of:Horror/Thriller: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.",2023-07-29
"The brothers have produced their first ever film debut; I have to admit it is a really solid horror film, and at the peak: one of the best paranormal/supernatural horror films in 2023. It's hard to believe that these guys came from humble beginnings (YouTube) and managed to secure a place where they could explore their talents to the fullest reach without being held back by budget constraints and censorship.Anyone who knows RackaRacka on YouTube can expect a return-to-form here on this movie with an amazingly ridiculous amount of violence, terror, and straight up bleak comedy infused into its characters and plot. It's simple and effective- it doesn't need the audience to indulge themselves on premise but rather to just sit back and enjoy the ride- and it's a beast of its own rite.I think for what it's worth, this is going to be a really fun movie to watch over and over. It's got a stellar cast that seems to understand the material really well and has fun with it altogether, and the direction is promising for a debut from two brothers.If you enjoy supernatural horror films, or any horror film for that matter, I could definitely name Talk to Me as a strong contender for your preference. It isn't perfect by any means, but it's too unique and self-identified to be passed up as a standard cliche horror movie; it's different and it enjoys being different. There's a lot to dig in to here, and I think if you give it a shot, you'd be more than pleasantly surprised by the work performed on all fronts of this production. It's a solid horror movie and will be on my shelf soon!",2023-07-30
"This Australian horror offering centers on Mia (Sophie Wilde), a grieving teen hungry for connection in the wake of her mother's death. A wall of silence has grown between her and her father. Her best friend, Jade (Alexandra Jensen), while loyal, has been distracted by a new boyfriend (Otis Dhanji). So, when possession parties pop up promising the thrall of escape, Mia's perhaps overeager to bound into the unknown. At first, it's all fun and twisted games. But when the game goes on too long, Jade's sweet little brother Riley (Joe Bird) pays a gruesome price. While his fearsome mother (Miranda Otto) searches for easy answers, Mia and her friend must look into the abyss of limbo to pull Riley back from it.",2023-04-02
"YouTube comic horror sensations, twin brothers Danny and Michael Philippou, crash into mainstream films by way of progressive film company A24, with a half-dead kangaroo and a haunted hand opening that gains immediate attention in Talk to Me. From there the film titillates by a series of shocks as good as it gets with seasoned filmmakers like Sam Raimi.Not yet done with this tour de force opening, the camera tracks a young man to a locked door at a party that should have stopped hours ago as he breaks down the door and extricates his younger brother, who was long ago freaked out in a probable encounter with the haunted hand, which will be introduced at said party shortly.The hand at the party is a connection to the macabre past, and it won't leave if someone holds it longer than 90 seconds. Of course, a callow teen will do that, ensuring that the hand can do its dirty work for the rest of the party and beyond. As metaphor, the hand serves as a reminder that evil doings can grab hold and never let go until said dumb teen gets taken away into a spiritual realm where former corpses act like zombies only a bit uglier.For those not making the final journey but experiencing the hand, their faces transform briefly into ghouls while their dilated eyes promise hell behind. Of course, the spectators howl with delight while filming for social media. That's what bored teen do in ultra-cool horror films, especially helped by Emma Bortignon's classic horror sound designGradually Mia (Sophie Wilde) takes over the struggle against the spirits, grappling with such phantasms as her deceased mother, or is it really she? Relentlessly Mia tries to defeat the micro possessions that come for her because she has stayed overtime, and repeatedly, dealing with her mother's alleged suicide.While the mayhem winds down, the film succeeds in showing grief can terrorize lives as it gets hold of inner fears and regrets. Not bad for new filmmakers.",2023-07-29
"I expected an engaging story, a movie with a congruent plot and at least a thriller looking at such high ratings but I was met with a horror trailer, you tube short storyesque thingie with an incoherent plot, random horror scenes, good camera work but confused attempt at film making. Its alright to watch this at home I guess but spending money on it and actually watching it in a theatre is not the best idea. This lacks a story. I mean there is something akin to a story here but it goes nowhere. It starts with wasting 15 minutes in the beginning where you expect to be introduced to the characters but instead of that there's random snippets of interaction from people's lives and ends the same way. I would say skip it.",2023-07-28
"I've known for a while that A24 only releases horror films for pretentious people that don't actually like horror, but want to watch horror. I know this, yet I keep watching the garbage they release in the hopes that just once (okay twice, as Tusk is a masterpiece of horror comedy) they'll release a good horror movie. Yet here we are once again, with a ""horror film"" that's well shot, but just an abysmal excuse for a horror film. I wish nothing but the worst for A24. Actually, that's not true. I wish them nothing but they best, even though they consistently put out the absolute worst drivel in ""horror""I wish I could give this garbage a 0.But since I can't: 1/10 avoid at all costs.",2023-08-01
"Talk to me is an original horror with a concept so perfectly set for the current climate that it makes it very believable. As a child of North Adelaide I can definitely feel the characters as genuine people I'd meet at High School, Absolute props to the Hayley and Joss characters who in a horror/ thriller film still have some one-liners that'll make you laugh with just the perfect delivery.The storyline is well thought-out, and you very quickly feel for all characters involved. I loved the way we flip back and fourth in the beginning seeing the possession process from both sides when Daniel has a turn and he sees the spirits for the first time. The lighter scenes give you a chance to get comfy with the possession idea and how it's all fun and games ... until it's not.The gore and the make up - Holy hell this is done well - for the amount of close ups, and in-camera action you can tell the teams behind this put in a hell of an effort to make sure everything looked as good as it possibly could. The scenes in the bathroom at the hospital defiantly got my stomach turning. And the blood rigs paired with the sound effects and quick pace action make you want to hide behind your blanket.This film is 100% one to watch and is so far above the current horrors coming out today, its original, it's clever and its down-right scary without relying on jump-scares or gimmicks . I cannot wait to see what the boys do next !",2022-10-31
"8.5/10
Talk To Me was more of like terrifyingly brutal than terrifyingly scary, the brutality from the demon that makes it unsettling and disturbing, while Talk To Me concept wasn't the most original, the duo Danny and Michael Philippou surely just created their own original style of directing in their very impressive debut in this possibly best directorial movie debut by a Youtube Content Creator, the very unique and impressive style of filmmaking, the story, the performances were all amazingly well done, it's very well crafted, and undoubtedly intense, i almost closed my eyes not because the scare of the demon or the jumpscare but because of the very excellent yet very disturbing gore that they have in the movie, i wasn't crazy and really that satisfying about the ending unfortunately, some slow part, and to be honest i wish there is more of the brutal hardcore scary stuff in the movie because that will make the movie even more crazier, they really do pretty lacking on that even though everytime they did it it's freakin incredible, and again not so original in the story but was i still invested to the story and to the characters for like 85% of the film?, Absolutely yes, despite the flaws the rest of the movie was awesome, and i have a fun intense good time watching it in the theaters, still overall Talk To Me is a very impressive directorial debut by the Philippou brothers, it's disturbingly intense fun movie.",2023-09-02
"Don't normally watch horror but this came up in a secret screening. I'm glad I watched it.Partying teens have a new party trick, being briefly possessed by saying to talk to me whilst holding a hand status. What could go wrong?Whilst I don't think it's an original idea it definitely was very well executed and probably one of the best possession films.The acting is very well done by all characters and the story arc of the main character is done incredibly well due to Sophie Wilde's performance but also the cinematography of her story throughout the film (don't want to give spoilers as to what I mean by this)
What I also like is it doesn't do cheap jumpscares (in fact there ain't many) but more goes for the shock effect (my cinema gasped at a couple of scenes) which really works for this film. It makes it alot more impactful.I think my only criticism is some parts of the story aren't as original as the directors think and could have gone a different route for those parts.Overall I enjoyed Talk to Me and a great effort for first time directors.",2023-07-24
"Psychological horror is one of the toughest to pull off, you can easily be doing stupidity in the name of attemting this genre. But the writing and screenplay of this film never lets it backfire. The plot is interesting, the occassional disturbing scenes work towards establishing the horror. Its not a jumpscare film, mind you, its a lot mature than that. The performances by the cast, especially by sophie wilde is one of the strongest points of this film. The screenplay is able to cinfuse us thriugh the intercut of reality and illusion and hallucinatuons. The use of dream imagery is wonderful in this film. The cinematography, specially the two long shot scenes at the terminal ends is too good a piece. My only gripe being the lack of emotional connect to and for the characters.",2023-08-07
I saw this film twice at the Adelaide Her Majesty's Theatre screening and the following day at the Palace Nova.Danny and Michael are some of the most talented and driven filmmakers on the planet. What they managed to achieve with Covid restraints and smaller end budget was incredible.The young Australian cast gave incredible performances and DOP Aaron Mclisky created an incredible visual experience.The YouTubers turned filmmakers have made a huge impact online and have proven they can take that talent to the big screen. The twins have a huge future ahead and will take the film world by storm.10/10.,2023-01-23
"I really liked it.It's a really fun creepy and mean possession/supernatural movie with good uses of effects, performances, tone, and writing. The directors Danny and Michael Philippou are the RackaRacka Bros whom I grew up watching their videos on Youtube as they made ridiculous but fun gory stunt work videos that were hilarious to watch. In the past, Youtubers have gotten the chance to make movies and most of them have honestly been really bad. But here, this movie is a wild ride and I really had a fun time watching it.Most of the production, settings and sound designs were pretty good and the uses of the effects regarding stunts or practical were well-done as it helped enhance the supernatural horror and creepy elements together. The camerawork is solid as there are some pretty cool camerawork shots anytime some of the horrific moments appear on screen. Many of the performances from the cast members are pretty good, especially Sophie Wilde and Joe Bird as each performance was strong and made the characters interesting to observe. Teenage characters can be really unlikable in horror movies and it was refreshing to see teenage characters feel real without making them over exaggerated and terribly written.The narrative is the typical horror possession concept with familiar tropes but the narrative works because it explores some new territories that surprised me and ideas that were refreshing and and I appreciate them not using the typical unnecessary jump scares and cliched tropes in generic horror movies. The dialogue is pretty good although there were a few dialogue moments that could use some work. Including some writing elements and tone that felt a little too similar to Sam Raimi. However, despite some small flaws, the film still succeeds with a great pacing, direction and writing that felt creepy, mean, and entertaining.Overall, this was a really great horror movie and probably the best movie made from Youtubers so far. If the Rackaracka Bros ever make another movie, I will love to see what they can make next.",2023-07-28
"Australian horror ""Talk to me"" could have been the same old thing with possession and spooky ghosts only the main characters can see. But its proper gruesome enough to keep old school fans happy, and manages to feel modern without being cringey and avoiding lame jump scares.There's a spooky hand doing the rounds at teenage parties. One that people hold to see ghosts before allowing the spooks to briefly possess them. Off course this is all going to go wrong. But it can be a brutal shocker so you'll not be disappointed in the direction it does go. Much like the latest ""evil dead"" its truly horrific, but also has the occasional awkward laugh. But this one also knows not to stick around for too long. As there's only so much horror the audience can take.",2023-08-02
"The film opens with a gruesome murder-suicide at a large teen party with it being caught on many cell phones. Mia (Sophie Wilde) is a student whose mother committed suicide two years ago. She is being raised by her father (Marcus Johnson). Her best friend is Jade (Alexandra Jensen). They are very close as she sleeps over there and is friends with Riley (Joe Bird) Jade's 15 year-old brother. Miranda Otto plays Jade and Riley's mother. The girls go out to a party where they play a game of communicating with the dead. Instead of the overused OUIJA board they use a ceramic cover embalmed hand of a medium. One person grasps the hand and says ""Talk to me."" An ugly spirit appears. The person then says, ""I let you in"" and the spirit possess the person. They have a 90 second timer on it or else the person may get possessed. Like tracing a call. Riley insists on playing. He ends up contacting Mia's mother who lets it run for two minutes and then the fun happens.The plot is similar to other horrors but the prop is different. The film was well done. Australian made.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",2023-09-18
"I'll probably say this a thousand more times, but any chance that I have to see a new film released by A24, I'll be there. Talk to Me is their latest theatrical release and while it's not one of their best, it's a very solid horror/thriller. Horror isn't my favourite genre, but I'll admit when one impresses me. This film plays it safe in terms of the story, but definitely not when it comes to the surprises/kills. Here are my thoughts on Talk to Me.This is a premise many filmgoers have experiences hundreds of times. A Group of teenagers have a party and the popular new trend sets a series of events in motion that will have some of the characters possessed, if not killed. This time around, it's a sculpture of a hand that reacts when you say the words ""Talk to Me."" Once a character grabs the hand and utters those words, they are shown a creepy image of a human who has passed on. Without ruining anything, this film gets a little deeper than I was expecting. The main character in Mia (Sophie Wilde) was easily the best part of this film.Mia's backstory and constant involvement in the game itself is what made this film sing for me. The loneliness and grief her character feels added a layer to this film that I wasn't expecting. Although certain storylines play out as you would expect them to and the final scene is just like many other films, the overall story and uniqueness of the object itself is what had me liking it so much. It also didn't hurt that Sophie Wilde is a great actress. I haven't seen her in anything aside from this simply due to the fact that she is a newer actress with only a couple of credits so far. I can't wait to see what she does next.On top of her incredible talent showcased in this film, she also had a hand in writing the story and directors Danny Philippou and Michael Philippou have also never directed a feature film before this. For newcomers being found online, this is a pretty terrific first little film. At just over 90 minutes, Talk to Me never overstays its welcome. It can feel predictable, but the shock value throughout the movie and genuinely creepy imagery kept me engaged. A Very solid flick that I can recommend to horror/thriller fans.",2023-07-31
"There are many unpredictable forces out there, and it's not really worth risking and challenging the supernatural. If you were to define ""Talk to Me"" as a horror movie, I gotta say I'm a bit disappointed. There aren't many truly spine-chilling scenes, and for me, it's more of a film about paranormal and mental twists. From the supposed possession and strange occurrences around the protagonist to them feeling like they're possessed themselves, it seems like they didn't really emphasize the ghost's power or a revenge plot. Kinda unfortunate, in my opinion. The Meg 2 playing at the theater next door is actually more enjoyable. The sound effects alone make it much less dull.",2023-08-17
"I went to see this film with great anticipation, and I'm glad I stayed until the end because I believe the horror genre, which often produces mediocre examples, needs more films like this one. It truly satisfied me.First of all, the Philippou brothers did an incredibly good job in their first feature-length film. There were a few scene transitions that left my girlfriend and me in awe, and there were moments when we couldn't help but exclaim, 'Wow, that scene was amazing.' Two of those standout scenes were the one showing Riley being possessed by spirits and the one where Mia first goes mad in the room. These scenes are worth watching multiple times. Sophie Wilde delivers a commendable performance that completely immersed me in the film.The film's biggest strength, in my opinion, was how it concluded. They managed to avoid unnecessary details at the end and delivered the best possible ending. This made me extremely happy. The characters' behaviors were also proportionate to their ages, which surprised and pleased me. I shouldn't forget to mention that the scene transitions were well-executed.A couple of things I didn't like include the character Sue, who is portrayed as a conscious mother but leaves her child alone in the hospital. That was the most significant disconnect for me, and I wish it had been more convincing. Another thing that seemed a bit forced to me was when Riley made direct contact with Mia, and she immediately became possessed by Mia's mother's spirit. However, I got used to it as the story progressed.Overall, the use of time, the cinematography, and the performances (including the directors) were all quite good. It's quite an achievement that they were able to make this film on a modest budget of only 4.5 million when even mediocre films often have budgets exceeding 80, 90, or 100 million. This film is modestly the best horror work of the year so far.",2023-09-08
"Concept: 8
Scares:4
Atmosphere / Cinematography:4
Plot:4
Acting:7
Sound:4What a dissapointment.What are we talking about here? Are we all watching the same movie? To call this a full fledged horror movie is a crime. Seems more of a story of loss with horror elements. The term horror is thrown very loosely nowadays. If your expecting to get scared, look somewhere else. It seems like people are more impressed and supportive that a few youtubers made this movie. Although while Impressive, does not over shadow that this movie is kind of a mess. Even the sound quality does not seem finalized. The acting was fine. Pacing was messy. Very focused on 1 character and the loss of her mother. Plot and concept are there just not executed correctly. Also everyone over hyping this movie does not help either. I was not blown away in any way. Ask yourself were you truly scared at the end of this movie? I was not, like I said horror elements scattered throughout but that dark atmosphere and horror segments were just not prevalent enough. Should have focused more on that great concept that the film started with and fully dived into the horror setting and paranormal elements. Instead we get a story of a cry baby girl whining all day. That is not horror. Great start with a good concept just needed more of the horror element. All horror movies have to have an artistic direction and meaning behind it.Can we just get a straight forward horror that is actually scary?",2023-08-06
"The writing did a great job of making the main character unlikeable and I was waiting for the movie to turn to have deeper meaning. I wanted it to.Also, the main character talking in a baby voice trying to sound younger was straight up odd. Riley held his character superbly and the dog was adorable.Casting such older people as teens is just getting really odd.This movie felt like each stage was written by a new person and then directed differently.Set design was greatThe story had such great potential, but lost umph and turned slightly sloppyGreat idea, just too many non ironed details and weird casting choices without enough adhesion for me. Love a great scary movie, but love even better writing.",2023-09-04
"Listen up, horror fiends! If you're a fan of Drag Me to Hell, Flatliners or Idle Hands, you're gonna love this gritty and gruesome Australian gem.Supernatural horror film Talk To Me is the theatrical debut of directing brothers Danny Philippou and Michael Philippou, known for their YouTube channel, Racka Racka.Talk To Me's story revolves around a group of friends who stumble upon a peculiar discovery-the ability to conjure spirits using an embalmed hand. What starts as a thrill-seeking experiment (filmed and shared online, naturally) quickly spirals into a terrifying ordeal when one of them takes their curiosity too far, unleashing sinister and supernatural forces upon themselves.With its tightly woven narrative and dry wit, Talk To Me keeps us both engaged and entertained throughout its entire 94 minutes. With this tight and tidy runtime, the story holds a good pace, builds suspense and provides levity in all the right moments-refreshing in an era where unnecessarily long features have become the norm!Talk To Me's raw and gritty cinematography captures everything we've come to love about Australian film. If you enjoyed Animal Kingdom, Snowtown and The Babadook, you'll love the authentic look and feel of this film.But, be warned! Talk To Me contains some brutal, head-smashing scenes that will avert even the biggest gorehound's gaze. I personally haven't seen special effects this realistic and visceral since the Argentinian horror film Terrified.Looking around me at the youngsters in the theatre, and considering the average age of the cast (basically foetal), I wondered if Talk To Me was going to be the average, run of the mill, soft teen horror flick. But, I'm thrilled to say it got under my skin with its interesting story, relatable characters and some pretty convincing performances from lead Sophie Wilde (Mia), newcomer Joe Bird (Riley), and Miranda Otto (Sue).Overall, Talk To Me is one of the most exciting horror movies to emerge from Australia in recent years. So, go watch. Let it in. Possession has never been so much fun!",2023-07-01
"Talk to Me (2023) is an Australian movie that I caught in theaters this evening. The storyline follows a group of teenagers who discover a statue with a real hand inside. When you touch the hand it releases spirits into the body of the hand holder. A group of teens push the connection to too far and pull something into our world that will ruin their lives forever.This picture is directed by Michael and Danny Philippou, in their directorial debut, and stars Ari McCarthy (Heartbreak High), Sarah Brokensha (Wolf Creek), Miranda Otto (The Lord of the Rings) and Marcus Johnson (The Spartacus series).This has a unique concept that reminded me of ""It Follows"" when it came out where it was like nothing we had ever seen. It's always fun when something different is entered into the horror genre. The acting was pretty good and Mia was appropriately annoying. Miranda Otto delivers a strong supporting performance. The horror elements were amazing. This has my favorite all time possession scene, but all of the possession scenes are very good. The makeup, masks and special effects were elite. Riley is a trooper in this. The violence is sudden, intense, brutal and gory...all boxes checked. The ending was solid and a perfect way to conclude the movie.Overall, this was an entertaining addition to the horror genre that I would score a 7.5-8/10 and strongly recommend.",2023-07-29
"It's a well done movie, considering it's budget. Well shot, good audio, acting is good. Not scary at all though.It's an interesting concept and story, but underdeveloped by a large margin. The initial premise that random kids have such an object is ridiculous by itself.My main problem with this movie that it's first half is just boring. Most of the characters are also quite annoying, which doesn't help feel you invested in them. There was almost no feeling of tension and there were little significant scares. I don't want to spoil anything, so I can only say that there are some quite shocking scenes due to violence, but that's it.I don't get the fuss about this movie. It's watchable and very forgettable.I hope that the authors will have an opportunity to make something bigger are more ambitious. There's a lot of promise in their work but the road ahead will be long.Mediocre, 6/10.",2023-09-29
"I watched it because this movie was raised, the rating on imdb is higher than 7. To be honest, I don't understand what to praise - for the hand or for something else? The hand is the main character, but no, a teenage girl! No, still a hand! The ultimate goal justifies all this ""marginality"" that is happening. Just think, 2 directors were shooting (this is how insecure you need to be) and three wrote the script - yes, it's just brainstorming, and what did they come to? - A girl whose mother committed suicide, and a boy who is trying to commit suicide, and these two storylines make up the whole scenario. In general, the film is about suicide and about suicidal actions, about a mental disorder in the scenery of the other world. The content of the film for a lover of such stories is very simple and intelligible.",2023-08-17
"There are things to admire in this film. The cast does a great job. In fact the very fine casting work matches a slate of interesting, differentiated characters developed in the script. However, good horror/suspense films establish some ground that gives us a greater understanding of the source of terror. There's a point to the horror. Here, there's no effort to establish anything like this. At best we have a picture of unsettled spirits from beyond wanting to inflict maximum pain and suffering on living people. That's at best. Even this leaves much to be desired. Why are they unsettled? Why are they motivated to torment people? What is the nature of these spirits from beyond, and what do they really want? The filmmakers don't appear interested to offer any point behind their slick production of stomach-churning gruesomeness. That can work for some films, maybe, but other qualities - camp, humor, smart ironies, a sense of adventure and so forth - usually come into play for something elevating and positively entertaining to occur. This film, on the other hand, is half-baked in this respect. And with so much serious gruesomeness it leaves a bad taste in the mouth. But it's worse than that. It plays on themes of suicide, grief, and serious mental illness like schizophrenia. It does so without a sense of responsibility. In a world where terror happens for no reason, serious issues like these are left dangling. The result is like someone poking grotesquely at a wound because nothing else interests them. Unfortunately this film is more diminishing and gross than positively entertaining.",2023-08-04
"Overhyped, overrated.The first half of the movie is boring and dull.Even the scared aren't scary enough.Disgusting sexual suggestion.The main character is annoying and has no depth.The story itself is poor, and the way it unravel is even worse. A lot of loose ends, relies on jumpscares rather than psychological horror which what the story supposed to provide.The first half of the movie is like watching a bad teenagers drama with endless parties, and pointless conversations.I regret every minute and cent lost to this movie.True disappointment especially that the 7.5 rating gave me a lot of expectations.",2023-08-08
"I went to go watch Talk to Me at the Adelaide Film Festival and man it was one of the best films I've watched in a long time. The Riley kid was so scary and his acting was just perfecto (i think his name is something Bird is his name and he was amazing), like from just the normal scenes and the scary ones, mans has a bright future.Rackaracka really surprised us with this one. Especially because they are just a couple of you tubers, but man they really pulled this off. It is so good that Adelaide is finally getting some recognition for aspiring actors and film makers growing up here. I'm pretty sure that Riley kid and James kid are from Adelaide which is super amazing and they both did really really well with there performances. Riley stunned us all with his acting capabilities while James delivered great one liners, and was super funny. Please go watch this film!Daniel is fine af and his acting was delivered beautifully. Mia's character was so good she was amazing too. Danny and Michael Philippou 1000% percent made a perfect horror film. Miranda Otto played a perfect mum and Alexandra Jensen was amazing too. I recommend 100%Like i watched smile the other week and it was so bad, i like how the movie is scary and makes you want to know whats going to happen next.",2022-11-02
"I'll preface this review by saying that I'm not a huge fan of ""possession"" type horror movies, so I'm perhaps a bit biased.It was by no means bad, but I couldn't help but feel like they did nothing but make the wrong, rash decisions at every point. I suppose this is typical of horror movies, but still frustrating.The main character was just completely unlikeable and under-developed - they didn't motivate her relationship with her mother nearly enough to make her choices understandable.Ultimately, some good scares and a good concept. But not quite enough under the surface to do it for me.",2023-08-04
"This movie is not awful but also not the most amazing horror movie ever like some are making it out to be. The characters are insufferable and so dislike-able that it makes it hard to care. The ending was also pretty bleak and left me and my group feeling very unsatisfied because it just felt sloppy. The moments of horror are great but are few and far in-between. The movie is more unsettling than scary and is also very dark. The hype around the movie did it a bid disservice because it is nothing like was promised in all the ads and mass reviews. Overall, the movie is okay, but isnt something I would care to see again.",2023-08-04
"First of all, its not a bad movie. I gotta admit i never heard about the youtubers that made the movie, but now i found their channel and the videos seem pretty cool and with high quality effects.But sadly overall all things considered, their first film is just another ""scariest movie ever"" hype which will ultimately disappoint any horror movie enthusiast, like it happens almost every year.I don't see the reason it can appeal to the younger public, because even containing situations which could be relatable to them, the movie is overall way too dramatic and boring. I can even ignore the fact that these actors are way to old to be playing high school kids. But personally there's just not enough substance to make this a great movie.I guess the movie runtime of 95 minutes hits the ""required"" mark of a standard horror film, but the movie could be much more dense with characters and lore, so i don't know why they didn't go for more. There was a lot of room to expand to introduce the ghosts better and provide more background to them. If you remember ""13 Ghosts"", you'll know what i mean - its not a spectacular movie itself bc of its own different issues, but having an ""ensemble"" of ghosts that had some background was the best thing about it.On the other hand, this movie's trailer is everything you need to see, even though it was crafted so well to attract interest, sadly it contained all the best scenes, and the rest is just boring drama filler. Is there a director's cut containing more? I certainly hope so...Having my expectations high, i couldn't give it more than 5 out of 10.",2023-09-12
"Something about the trailers rubbed me the wrong way... but this is getting astounding hype so I had to check it out.Let me start by saying there's obviously much skill on display here. There are some very well crafted scenes and the movie as a whole is very well shot.But overall Talk to Me didn't quite win me over. The characters are very dumb and I wasn't sold on getting possessed as a fun party trick - especially how the pushback was essentially non-existent. Seemed like no one had any knowledge of the opening scene?The movie does avoid a boring middle where the characters back trace and try to find the origins of the object. But since we know nothing about the hand, I felt like I had to accept way too many premises and the rules became a bit muddy. Especially with that ending. That's a bit of a silly ending, isn't it?",2023-07-30
"Intro has limited exposition; Im not a fan of spelling everything out for the viewer but, minimal origin details of the hand are shared. This leaves us feeling lacking, possibly intentional artistic choice to increase unease. The plot even with its holes is predictable, if you have ever seen any demonic spirit movie. Rules for exchanges with spirits follow trope. The spirits channeled through the hand are disjointed. Lack of exposition leaves us wondering if the hand itself is what is collecting the souls. Are the spirits we see it's collection, or random entities? The ending gives the impression that the spirits are collected souls. The hand appears to pass blindly from owner to owner until it finds someone grief stricken, and desperate enough to allow it in permanently. The hand then imitates a lost loved one, causes delusions, and eventual murder/suicide; thus adding to its collection. Almost the entire move is set at night except the last bit causing headaches in those more sensitive to changes in lighting. Perhaps another intentional artistic choice, leaving the viewer off guard. The cast was great, special effects on point, jump scares were appropriately placed/timed. The only reason I'm not rating the movie higher is for predictability, lack of exposition, and 50% score for originality. Feels like a diluted version of an Ari Aster film.",2023-07-31
"TALK TO ME is to me the third best horror film this year because these two Australian directors did stunts with YouTube but going into A24's Australian film was exactly what I expected a horror film that was done right. 96% of the film was absolutely unexpected we get amazing cinematography, excellent characters/actors, great pratical effects and very good story & writing and so on. 4% of the film was nit picky because there was nit picky issues with while I was watching it. It's nothing like X, Pearl, The Witch, Midsommar and Hereditary which they are very good and excellent horror films from A24.",2023-08-10
"Talk to Me is a horror film that really earns that title because it is truly disturbing and uncomfortable viewing in the most effective ways. A terrifying film that pulls no punches and uses its gore to horrifying effect. It feels like the millionth horror about grief and trauma but it's also a really good exploration of the lack of real connection in the social media age.Sophie Wilde is incredible, its a performance that requires so much emotionally and she performs every moment in a way that feels so genuine. On the opposite side, she's also excellent at conveying the addictive yet uncomfortable out of body experience of being possessed. Each one feels completely different.From the brutal opening sequence Danny and Michael Philippou prove themselves to be naturals at building suspense and creating violent imagery designed to linger long after the credits. Any uncomfortable self inflicted injury is made worse by Emma Bortignon's sound design, just as painful to hear as it is to watch.",2023-07-28
"This film looks like many of its peers. The beginning scene was a great introduction to what to expect from the rest of the film.The story revolves around a group of modern teenagers who play a deadly game involving a severed hand and a willing participant. To begin, they need to hold the said hand and utter the words ""talk to me,"" followed by ""I let you in."" A spirit will then appear before the participant, and they have 90 seconds to allow the spirit to possess them and communicate with the people surrounding them. If the participant plays longer than 90 seconds, there will be dire consequences...Mia (Sophie Wilde) is a troubled teen who is more than willing to play this deadly game. She breaks the golden rule of the game and plays it longer than 90 seconds, which leads to her experiencing hallucinations among other things...The gore scenes are surprisingly more intense than what you would typically see in this genre of films. The writers have done a commendable job of keeping the viewers on the edge of their seats. The ending is particularly satisfying. Well done.",2023-08-06
"The Philippou brothers decided to bet on themselves to make their first full feature movie. From YouTubers to filmmakers. It is clear to me that they put a lot of passion and work into this project. They could easily stay in their comfort zone and make a body-horror comedy, but they actually decided to go for a darker tone, with a more serious plot. For sure their background helped them a lot for the gory scenes. Some sequences are brutal and do not shy away from graphic details. The plot departs a bit from the usual possession genre, introducing some interesting elements that are slightly different than the usual tropes. I loved the idea of the embalmed hand that opens a gate with the world of the dead, where you can even let yourself be possessed. Despite all the pros, story-wise I feel that this is just another teen horror film that does not really stand out from the rest of the pack. To be fair, this is also a genre that has been extremely inflated over the course of the past few years, so it is really hard to make something truly fresh.I really liked the editing and I think it is the strongest point of this movie. There are some sequences that make the film flow really nicely. This film from a technical standpoint just works and it can be taken as an inspiration to make horror films less boring and more stylish, using the modern tech that directors have available and using it to the fullest. Sophia Wilde and Joe Bird gave the best performances, the rest of the cast was pretty average, but they managed to pull out a decent job. The group of teens was central and actively contributed to develop the story. I feel that no one was left behind, or added just to fill a few minutes. I congratulate to RakaRaka for doing this film and I am sure that with more experience in the film industry, they will be able to release some good flicks, but in this case my mark is 5.7.",2023-10-04
"This is the first time in a very long time that I've been truly unsettled by a horror film. I just kinda had to sit with it for a few minutes after the credit roll; this one is going to stick with me for a while. Horror is one of my favorite genres, so when I saw that this was the choice for a ""mystery"" advanced screening, I was delighted!Everything about this film was completely on point: the story, the acting, the special effects, the cinematography, the direction...all of it was just amazing.Was I horrified? Yes.Was I thrilled? Yes.Did I like it? ..... Yes?Am I going to go see it again? Absolutely.",2023-07-11
"Don't get me wrong there are some really good bits in Talk To me, however the film feels disjointed and lacking substance in parts. I don't feel that it is as fantastic as people are rating it. I feel it is 2023's Smile. (remember how people were raving about that?)
I think viewers are so desperate for a decent horror movie, that when one that is good comes along they tend to over rate it.I didn't find Talk to Me scary at all. I understand that I am desensitized to horror. I enjoyed the violent side, there were a few very intense violent scenes.But when it comes to the supernatural, sometimes I think less is better.",2023-08-13
"What is the most famous Australian horror movie of all time? ""The Babadook"", which strangely has a way lower rating on this site. If you compare that film to this one, you will invariably notice that the writing is much tighter. There is nothing excessive or unnecessary. The atmosphere keeps building throughout the entire film. And the suspense of not knowing whether or not you're watching a supernatural event or a psychological breakdown never lets up.""Talk to me"" starts with an establishing scene that gives away what is going to follow. The embalmed hand of the poster is a poorly made prop compared to the genuinely scary children's book in ""Babadook"". And what I really did not like is the resolution, which combines a psychological and supernatural explanation in a very lazy way. The last shot was completely unnecessary - in horror, less is more.The popularity of what is ultimately an average low budget psycho thriller with an illogical twist must be due to the lack of any solid horror films lately. Better re-watch or discover classics with a similar vein but better execution, like ""The Innocents"" (1961), ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968), ""Don't look now"" (1973) or ""Jacob's Ladder"" (1990).",2023-09-19
"Great representation of grief done in a respectful way. It's hard to watch at times, but so is hearing what has to be said. Just hold on and put the poor animal to sleep.Miranda Otto nailed her role as the mum. Literally mimicking every worried parent out there with kids that participate in (failed?) TikTok challenges.Would've liked a bit more story arc on Mia's dad, but was fine for his story to be left open to interpretation.Overall, solid Aussie horror film from the filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou. Congrats on their feature directorial debut. Got to 'hand' it to them. Look forward to see what grotesque ideas they come up with for their next film.",2023-07-12
"Based on 1 cool idea for a horror, built the whole script around it and pass it off as a horror film. Atrocious acting, well maybe it was the script. Really bad direction. Apart from the gory intro, the next 20mins was unbearable to watch. Nothing the characters do moves the plot forward. Most of the teens just earns a tight slap on the face, especially that butch. 32mins in, i was clutching my fists and shutting it off. Trying to be an antagonist and pissing the audience off is entirely different things. So I don't know what all these other reviews are on about. Close friends of actors? Production crew? 1 star the idea. 1 star for the intro.",2023-09-24
I give it 3 stars for the ending but all the characters are insufferable.This is another movie where there are no positive role models or father figures. Are the 'kids' suppose to be teenagers? They look too old for the roles. So instead of drugs they get high from letting an evil spirit enter their body? Where did the 90 second rule come from? Was that from trial or error?Anyone who rated this over 4 Stars is either a friend or family member of the cast or hasn't watched very many horror movies. They have this montage of everyone trying 'The Hand' and getting 'high' which is so annoying I had to turn down the volume.Overall this is a movie you watch with the volume turned way down while listening to grass grow.This scores a 1/10 on the 'Rewatchable Meter'.,2023-09-12
"That Babadook ,in my opinion ,is definitely one of the best ever psychological horrors , I was waiting with a great anticipation the release of this film...Sorry to say , but what a disappointment... Overused story , which could have been ok with a likable cast of characters , instead we get an ugly crowd of spoiled whiny brats for heroes... To say the truth , after first 15 minutes , I wanted all of them dead , preferably in a slow agonising way ) Can't take it on myself , to dare to recommend it to anyone at all , especially to real fans of the great genre of all : horrors ))) Avoid . At any cost.",2023-09-17
"I was really hoping for a good movie. But it was lame. Not exciting, not scary, not new at anything. Lead actress looks like an old(er) woman. Weird that she hangs out with young boys. She even lies in bed with a boy. Later it seems they are teens of the same age. The story is not new, not interesting and not credible. Stupid teens summon spirits and somehow know exactly how to do it, and how to time it. Yaaaawn. It never even gets a little bit scary. It just goes on and on. It started boring, and never got better, I turned the movie off after one hour. I skipped parts until the end, and I missed absolutely nothing. I wont watch this again even if I get paid for it.",2023-09-13
"I went in blind. I read about it without spoils and it started off good. First 5 mins. Then it hits you with a sob love story... your just waiting for stuff to happen..::it never happens lol. I almost fell asleep: no jump scares. Nothing creepy. Maybe only once. Honestly wish I saved money and watched it online. It drags out but I've seen low budget movies that were better. If you get to the toe sucking part it made me laugh but overall it could have been a good movie, maybe the thought of the idea with the hand and the spirits but it was literally a dump. Who ever is writing a 'horror' movie. Let's be honest???",2023-08-12
"What is all this overrated hype for this movie. It must be the worst horror I have seen since the last overhyped film, (Blair Witch). There was nothing the least bit scary in the whole movie. The only scene worth waiting for was the head banging scene. The acting was juvenile at best, made by people without any knowledge of filming scary films. And as for making a sequal, oh my god, what is the horror world coming to. I sat there towards the end expecting something gobsmacking to happen just to make my visit to the cinema worth going, but did it, no! I am presuming most of the high scoring came from 15 to 20 olds who have not seen any good horrors in the cinema before. I certainly won't be rushing back to see the follow up film unless it includes some better actors and directed and produced by people that are not just out of film school (that's what it seems like).",2023-08-17
"Talk To Me did not make ""horror movies horrifying again"".Ari Aster did that with Hereditary and Midsommar, as did Roger Eggers with The Witch.I must say that I found it suspicious when I was told by the ticket girl that we were in for a real treat and that she's had nightmares for weeks after watching this movie. I then asked her how it compared to Hereditary. ""Oh, I hated Hereditary"". Ummmm-hmm.As indicated in the title, it was well produced, acted, written and directed, but if you're looking for a groundbreaking horror movie that is going to revive the genre... see it as a teenager.All in all, it was better than average.",2023-08-09
"I'd waited quite a while to watch this film and was really looking forward to watching it seen as it's kept it's really high rating for a while now. What a complete let down!!! It's a teen horror, with a teen mentality and imagination. This could have been such a good concept / film but sadly it's not.Viewers rating this film 6+ must have watched some really bad horrors to feel it deserves anything above 4 at best.A horror should frighten you, scare you, make you jump.... All this does is make you feel depressed!!I started writing this review part way through the film but now I've gotten to the end I'm even more depressed and gutted I wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this rubbish!",2023-09-15
"Original premise, solid acting and a great ending. The actors were largely unknown here in the US, but they did an excellent job establishing the characters and progressing the story. Directing was also solid. The scenes were well developed and the shots were dark and creepy, which helped build tension and suspense as the movie progressed. This is horror that is psychological enough and creepy enough to appeal to horror junkies and drama fans alike. The ending was great and wrapped everything up perfectly. I thought the story was also very original but with parts that harkened back to the best stuff in the 70's and 80's. It is a must see but be careful, it will suck you in so enjoy.",2023-10-08
"First I gotta to say that I enjoyed this movie overall. The first half is very tense and pretty good, but the second half becomes quite predictable. A lot of parts reminded me too much of other movies like the wounded animal in the beginning of the film as a bit of foreshadowing. It has been done quite a bit already (like in Get Out, The Invitation, Wendigo etc...). Ghosts that pretend to be a loved one but have harmful intentions and possess protagonist to hurt family members is basically the premise of Ouija - Origins of Evil. The moving shape in the shadows is already a cliche and was never as scary as in the korean movie A Tale of Two sisters. The shocking first act moment involving a kid is very Hereditary. I haven't seen a trailer or read what the premise is about beforehand, but somehow I expected this to be more of a creepy experience, given the premise. Instead, it goes more for graphic violence. There was word of mouth that this was the next Hereditary, but unfortunately this isn't in the same league, although I was rooting for it. Nonetheless for a first time movie, this is quite impressive with a really good performance by the cast. I wished they would have done more with the overall premise but I would still recommend it for horror fans.",2023-08-13
"No high intense drama, no arc of trauma, not a fabulous storytelling
Great choose of characters, that they are not conventional looking making them more attractive, real, everyday, great idea to connect with the everyday audience member. Similar to an apology to drug abuse and teenage party rituals. Good stuff; the cinematography. Aaron those a great job using natural light. Good composition. Great use of the scenery. Story wise was a bit of a letdown. There's no elevation of anything. Is it better than the average Netflix millionaire productions, by a clear mile yes. I was very connected with the story the first 30 min, after started to fade. I would it had deleted many scenes and add some other ones. I guess there was a bit of over exposure in many of the plot lines but that's the issue that it really tried hard to tell a compelling story but it felt disjointed and broken, (not intended, I believe). Overall not the best scary Aussie film. Still the babadook being the best. With a very compelling and emotional story of trauma.",2023-08-06
"""Talk To Me"" a movie I was excited to see. This is my third Australian horror film I've seen behind ""Relic"" (one of my favorites), and the Babadook.This movie was complete garbage. It took scenes from ""Relic"" and is basically a less compelling version of ""Annabelle Comes Home"".The movie has very obvious foreshadowing and I found myself falling asleep while watching it. All the horror elements are structure the same and feels like an AI wrote them. The most interested part was barely in there and just teenagers saying stories they heard so you get no first hand information. There was sound mixing issues and the dialogue was clunky. There was so many useless characters and it took a good chunk of the movie to settle on a main one. Don't get me started about the ending it doesn't even make sense with the rest of the film because the film basically says nothing the whole movie. People were calling out the twists about two scenes before they were happening.This felt like someone who watched one horror movie and thought they could make there own. I loved how people complained about ""Slenderman"" but that's a masterpiece compared to this film. It feels like it was written by someone who never went to high school everything was so robotic.This movies has no redeemable qualities I was extremely disappointed. It's scarceness comes from gore as a shock factor which honestly isn't scary.Honestly 0/10 one of the worst movies I've seen and it barely counts as a story. I would skip seeing this convoluted mess. If anyone disagrees talk to the hand ✋ .",2023-07-29
"Talk to Me is a refreshing entry in the world of horror. A24 is consistently producing high quality original horror films that manage to find new niches to fill, while still maintaining the core aspects of movies in this genre.With shocking scenes of violence and scares, Talk to Me keeps you on edge with no idea of what might unfold next. From the opening scene to the final frame, I remained invested and surprised at what I was witnessing. I can see the hand becoming a classic object in the genre. Hopefully this film finds an audience, as its smart thrills manage to unnerve even the most veteran of horror watchers.",2023-10-13
"I went in to this movie expecting ""the scariest movie of the year"" and all I got was one mediocre jump scare. The concept itself had incredible potential but sadly the script didn't take it there. Instead it trodded along comfortable being a teen drama/thriller with the odd horror element thrown in here and there.On the positive side, it at least it did have a satisfying ending, even though it was also the most obvious resolve. The cinematography was also fantastic, and all the performances were solid. So while it was expertly crafted by the first-time filmmakers, any true horror fan will be sadly disappointed by this.",2023-07-31
"I always feel the need to caveat that I'm not much of a horror fan. That's not strictly true though, I'm just picky. I shy away from gore, films like the Saw franchise and the bloody awful Hostel leave me cold. I need substance. The question is, does Talk to Me have it? It's certainly attention grabbing. The opening scene at an Aussie house party with a clearly troubled man with a knife gives an inkling of where this might go, but first we need to meet some folks and find that substance. Enter Mia (Sophie Wilde), Jade (Alexandra Jensen) and her little brother Riley (Joe Bird). Mia's lost her mum, doesn't get on with her dad. Jade and Riley don't really get on with their mum and dad's no where to be seen. This isn't so much important as to highlight they're tight. Looking out for each other in a peer group that likes to apply pressure, push buttons and mess around with possessed embalmed hands. Yep you read right, that's the hook here. No shock it's on the poster. Go to a party, get strapped in a chair by the irritating Hayley (Zoe Terakes) and say ""Talk to me"". There's rules to the game, but that's not important. Mia is lost. Looking for someone, something to belong to and so excepts the challenge. Cue some freaky cuts revealing dead souls looking to return through the vessel of whoever's holding the hand. Things of course get a little out of control. Of course they do, but it's all pretty fun, to begin. Kids mucking around. Having fun. Hanging out. Messing with the underworld. Until... Riley has a go. I don't want to give any spoilers, but it's obvious who he's going to connect to and when he does, all hell breaks loose. It's creepy and gory in the right places. It hits plenty of tropes, but uses them well and I'll forgive any of them for the simple reason that it's all really well acted. Particularly Wilde, she carries this. Those around her are all good, but a lot of this is on her shoulders and she gives it real weight. The deeper we get, the further it digs. Pushing this way beyond the standard teenage rage driven horror. It ploughs its dark themes carefully and thoughtfully. Don't get too comfy though, this has layers that go darker than certainly I saw coming. If you want an inventive horror that keeps you guessing and genuinely engaged, give this a go. It's not perfect, but it's certainly got substance.",2023-10-28
"I watched Talk to Me at a mystery screening and now I'm typing this review up in the car in a state of shock.I cannot express enough how unexpected every twist in this movie was. I was seriously scared. This movie is definitely not for the faint of heart. There's some heavy stuff- the emotional conflict behind the screwed up decisions of some of the characters is very palpable. It's scary in a psychological way but also has a couple jump scares, however I wouldn't say at all that it's the jump scares that makes it so terrifying.The ending was pretty open-ended, so I'm expecting and hoping for a part two already.I'm still processing, but I can't recommend this movie enough. It was incredible.",2023-07-11
"This movie was incredibly well advertised- I will give it that. After seeing hundreds of ads for this, I had to go see it. I don't often see things in theater, but if this movie is truly what people say, I would like to experience it on the big screen.Although the plot is new and in a sense, fresh, it still leaves a lot unaccounted for. There is not a lot of explanation of what it really means or represents. And even though the sfx and acting a decent, i don't actually know how to feel for Mia as a character. People seem to dislike her at the first party, but we never figure out why. We feel bad for Riley, but that's because of the obvious. For me, after Rileys gorey scene, the film falls off. Scenes start to blend. There doesn't seem to be a lot reason, and of course lots of jumpscares in order to keep you watching. People saying that it made them ""sick"" or ""disturbed"" obviously haven't seen the real bone chilling movies that have come out in the last fifty years. Although some scenes are uncomfortable, none of it felt scary. To me, this film tried really hard to evoke It Follows, were we follow a main girl battling her own inner demons and physical demons, but the plot is unique and original. While Talk to Me hasn't been written before, it follows similar lines of sequence. A broken girl who falls upon something extremely dark. But the issue is that I don't actually know how to feel for Mia. In the end, when Mia kills herself, we are suppose to juxtapose this with the kangaroo being put out of its misery, but I'm not really seeing that.Not to be harsh, but based on seeing interviews with the director brother duo, this horror film may have been a bit too close to home. Teenagers partying with a flare of death is not really a fun nre horror idea to be frank.Wait to stream it for free. You'll thank me later.",2023-08-06
"Talk to Me follows the now mainstream trend for Horror movies that's spirits and possessions. It's become a familiar territory now, indeed, and this movie is seemingly trying to set itself apart from the crowd by introducing some new ideas to tackling the unknown, and though not really horrifying, it's officially scary and sometimes disturbing, too. I didn't exactly like the film tone, and it would've been served better had the execution and feel been Hollywoodian. I felt the ending could've been a bit clearer, and I'm still not sure as to whether the incident with kangaroo and it's reappearance towards the end indicate or mean anything. The movie overall is not that entertaining, but is fine still and not at all a bad watch.",2023-07-31
"I watched this film based on the 7.4 score which is really high for a horror film on imdb. I should've have known better..........
Hoping to see something similar to The Coniuring but ended up being very similar to The Babadook - poor acting, terrible characters and weak storyline.The only character the audience has any connection to (the innocent younger brother) is the one we have to watch suffer through the entire film.I'm writing this in the cinemas contemplating whether to walk out. This film is insufferable!! I'm going to walk out of the cinemas feeling depressed and exhausted. Waste of a Saturday :(",2023-09-02
"Talk to Me is a exceptionally strong debut from the Philippou brothers. To preface, I've known their YouTube channel and their short videos from back in the day but haven't watched them in a long while. The fact they got a official movie to come out is necessary of praise on it's own. Very skilled filmmakers. And this translated to the movie seamlessly.Now this certainly isn't a ''youtube movie'', as in, you can feel the budget or something. Not at all. It's A24 and it feels like a A24 movie.Directing is really strong. It's highlight is that it's snappy, moves fast. And uses scares effectively. It's not jumpscare-y in a cheap way either. It's done well and some scenes are played very straight and flat, letting the horror do it's thing. It feels refined.On top of this, the sound design is fantastic. Really stood out to me as really well done, sold the scenes, sold moments. Just the slaps in that one scene, it's very reminiscent of their editing style in some of their youtube videos, it's super snappy and aggressive and could almost be seen as a jumpscare but it does works so well, it sells the aggression and shock. Music was good too, sometimes a little overbearing and not super memorable as in having a tun you will remember, but it supported the movie sufficiently.Acting/characters. Good, not much to note. I wasn't blown away in particular by anyone. But the scenes that mattered never felt fake so they nailed that. Besides that totally fine. Characters and writing.. a bit weaker and the part where being a debut shows. There's just some missing logic here and there and the things they say sometimes felt somewhat far reached. None of it jarring though.Scary factor/gore/vfx. Gore/VFX really, really good. Nothing to note besides that it's very effective. Scary factor, strong opener, and it got 2 jumps out of me. But after the first talk to me scene you get the gist. Besides that it didn't thrill me much anymore. It felt like it needed to escalate a bit more to be satisfying. But it focused more on some character and drama sections of the story. Which is fine.That said, a great horror with a cool concept.",2023-09-23
"First of all, I could not find one likable character. All of the kids are obnoxious to a cartoonish degree. I immediately cared nothing for anyone presented in the first act. I was really hoping they would be humbled by their ineptitude and maybe at least one of them would have some sort of narrative development. Well, still waiting on that.And, to that point, the story really doesn't move all that much. It's very one trick. And that's the hand thingy. It causes bad things to happen. But we have seen cursed spirit channeling objects before. Like in every Ouija movie.This movie takes a decidely Jacob's Ladder/Serpent and the Rainbow turn into obscurity which I suppose might be cool for some people but it mostly dragged on. Only so much of that was needed but the film based its entire thrill factor on deceitful spirit after deceitful spirit. I got it after two or three times. That's the problem. When I don't like the ""protagonists"" of a horror film, I quickly side with the menace. And the menace in this film is just bland and played out when it really needed to wow me.Oh, plus the ending is just a riff on Skeleton Key and The Others. I wasn't really into it. People who have never seen a movie might be.At least the dog survived. I didn't feel much for anyone else so their plights meant little to me. Now my suffering on the other hand ended with the credits.",2023-09-14
"This movie was frustrating, to say the very least. I went in with already low expectations and it was actually worse than I thought it would be. The characters are all brainless. The plot is so SO bad and these things drag this movie down tremendously. While there are a few scenes that are genuinely creepy it gets bogged down by how bad everything else is. None of it makes sense. Why are teenagers completely unphased by these supernatural things that are happening around them in the beginning?? They're just totally cool with possession? Even to the point where its a humorous parlor trick? No. This makes zero sense and isn't how real life would work if all of these supernatural things were real. That in particular completely ruined this movie for me. The hype built up and the scores at the present time are not representive of how ""good"" this movie is. Don't buy into the hype. This was trash.",2023-09-16
"Talk to Me is a 2022 Australian horror film directed by Danny and Michael Philippou. The film follows a group of friends who discover how to conjure spirits using an embalmed hand. They become hooked on the new thrill, until one of them goes too far and unleashes terrifying supernatural forces.The film has been praised for its creepy atmosphere and effective jump scares. However, some critics have found the film to be derivative and overhyped. If you replace the embalmed hand with a Ouija and a seance, then you pretty much have a film that has been done before. The embalmed hand just replaces the ouija and seance.I found Talk to Me to be a watchable but not in the same level as A24's Hereditary. They aren't even the same type of horror film so I don't understand the comparison made between both films other than they were both produced by A24.The film has some good ideas, but they are not fully developed. The characters are underdeveloped and the plot is predictable. I would have liked if they developed the spirits of the great beyond better than they did.Overall, I wasn't impressed with it because of how overhyped it became. I walked in with higher expectations because of the hype and it failed to deliver. Its watchable, but maybe just once. Hereditary can be watched multiple times and analyzed because the film was significantly better developed. But I can't see both films being compared because this is more of a teen horror film.Here are some of the things I liked about the film:The creepy atmosphere. The film does a good job of creating a sense of dread and unease. The effective jump scares. The film has a few well-placed jump scares that will make you jump out of your seat. The gore. The film is not afraid to show some violent blood and gore.Here are some of the things I didn't like about the film:The underdeveloped characters. The characters are not very well-developed and it is hard to care about them. The predictable plot. The plot is very predictable and there are no real surprises.The pacing issues. The film has some pacing issues and it drags in some places.Overall, I would give Talk to Me a 6/10. It is a watchable film, but it is not a great film. If you are a fan of the horror genre, you may find some things to enjoy in this film, but I would not recommend it to someone looking for a deeper story like what you would find in Hereditary or Midsommar.In terms of the film being overhyped, I think that is a fair assessment. The film has been getting a lot of positive buzz, but I think it is being praised more for its potential than for its actual execution. The film has some good ideas, but they are not fully realized. The film also suffers from some pacing issues and underdeveloped characters.",2023-09-12
"Surprisingly impressive new Australian horror, made for practically nothing but out of nowhere has become one of the biggest financial successes of the year, making its budget back 20 times over, so far.The story is centered around a bunch of teens who have come into possession of what is said to be a dead fortune-teller's hand, and by holding it they get to commune with the dead. The fresh new take on this well-worn tale mostly revolves around the ways the teens treat the experience like a drug or content to be posted on their social media accounts, with little consideration of the weight or meaning or forces involved.The young cast are all solid, better in most cases than the majority of actors the same age you'll see on TV or in big-budget movies, and the lead actress, Sophie Wilde, is particularly good. It speaks to the amount of loving care and attention that must have gone into the film's making that they could make something that looks and feels like such a real and genuinely engaging movie with so few funds, but regardless of the budget it's rare to see a film so tightly and competently made today.",2023-10-27
"The plot of the movie is interesting. A teenage girl was invited to a group meet, where they summon spirits and actually letting the spirit possess them for a short while. They seems to be having ""fun"" by doing this. Because the spirit says and do stupid things and they laughed.But soon they let the teenager girl's younger brother play in the ritual, and that's when everything goes south. The spirit who possessed him appears to be their dead mother. The teenage girl refuse to push the spirit out, and waited for longer time, while she asks questions to her dead mom.Then, the brother seems to be forced into another possession by another spirit, who is evil in nature. The spirit was able to make the boy hurt himself badly.Then the girl kept on seeing spirits, and she couldn't differentiate which is real and not anymore and she ended up killing her own father. *facepalm*The ending is just stupid, because she committed suicide and she ended up being just another spirit who is also tied to the same ritual.Overall, good effects esp on the spirits, and wounds, but storyline could have been better.",2023-09-24

Overall, a decent horror movie that has its fair share of scares with its mysterious conflict/story and pretty good execution, but the movie is a bit too short and does not really go above and beyond in any way to usher it into a higher echelon of horror movies.Decent to Pretty Good Direction (Moves the story well as they use mystery of the conflict to help build the suspense; get a good amount of pretty inexpereinced/younger actors (does not feel like cheesy horror movie acting)), Decent to Pretty Good Acting (Pretty Good from Sophie Wilde (Holds her own well as the lead and uses fear and paranoia to help drive her perfomance into being something scary), Decent to Pretty Good from Alexandra Jensen (Plays the cautious foil best friend to the protagonist and does a decent job holding her own), Decent to Pretty Good from Joe Bird, Decent from Otis Dhanji, Decent to Pretty Good from Miranda Otto (Plays the mom trope well and instills some comedy into the movie early on), Decent to Pretty Good from Zoe Terakes, Decent from the rest of the cast (Everyone plays their role and there are no real bad performances throughout the movie)), Decent to Pretty Good Story (Interesting concept and story, and this is driven forward by keeping the conflict mysterious (which makes there be no real conflict resolution (which is fine)); the story elements are good as they really do explain the artifact in a way that it is scary and mysterious; the biggest issue is there is just not that much plot (the movie is very short so it is hard to fully develop all the characters)), Decent to Pretty Good Screenplay (Pretty tight writing for a horror movie (not really corny at all and has some allusions to the beginning of the movie to help tie things in the end); jokes are decent and help lighten the mood at points; no really symbolism or bigger message; foreshadowing is decent and helps tie elements from the beginning to the end), Pretty Good Score (Helps with building suspense), Pretty Good to Good Cinematography (Especially for how low budget it was), Good Sound (Helps with building suspense), Good Editing (Helps make the movie more polished), Pretty Good to Good Visual Effects (Pretty Smooth and seamless for a majority of the movie (but it was very obvious when they were using a Rain Machine in one of the scenes)), Pretty Good Makeup (A bit low budget, but helps with creating the grime and horror moments of the movie), Plot Structure was pretty standard for a horror movie (but the movie ends with an ambigous climax to help keep the conflict mysterious and unresolved); the runtime is pretty short so 15-20 minutes added to the rising action could help make the conflict a bit more mysterious/scary, Pacing was good (not too fast or slow), Climax (ends on the climax, which is what it should have done), Tone was typical to other supernatural horror movies.",2023-08-05
"I really wish the events of the movie were more concrete. I watched the movie carefully for hints that things weren't as they seemed, (mirrors, eyes, etc) and nothing was strange except for the foot scene. If Mia was possessed from the first session and was seeing things the whole rest of the movie I would've hoped for more hints toward that. My favorite part of horror movies is thinking back to the hints throughout the movie to the twist/explanation at the end. Those subtleties that help put the pieces together at the end while not spoiling it are the best. They show the knowledge and forethinking of the filmmaker. Maybe on a rewatch I would notice a few more but I was on the lookout for these hints and didn't see any. Seeing as the other foreshadowing in the movie was very obvious (as soon as I saw the roadkill scene I knew the 'put it out of it's misery' thing would come back up) I wouldn't be surprised if there weren't any. I think I would really enjoy this movie if this was demonstrated clearly. You can't give us one scene when the rules of the universe haven't been explained. I left the movie confused in a disappointed way. I genuinely asked the person I saw it with if they filmmakers just hadn't thought through the details enough to put the hints in. If the explanation of the movie is what I think it is, then it just feels like a film that would've been great if it wasn't missing the nuances that make me love movies like it so much. Hopefully this is just due to the fact of their inexperience as filmmakers, I'd actually really like to see their next project. If it's like this one but including the small details this one lacked, I think it will be a great film.",2023-08-21
"TTM has a very good premise and the start leads fairly well with a sense of foreboding. The introduction to the characters and their dynamics is good in setting up the premise.However I would have wanted to see more of the encounters with the spirits and less of the kids partying in the lead up to that.There are missed opportunities for scares, where the tension builds but there isn't an outlet with a scary spirit or jump moment.The film loses direction a bit before recovering in the last 15/20 minutes with a good twist.Overall it was enjoyable but felt a bit budget and didn't always his the mark.",2023-07-31
"This movie with okay-good. I don't get the big hype around it and also to everyone saying it's one of the scariest movie of the year/decade??? It was more of a suspenseful drama for me.Overall, the movie is worth the watch. A24 is just killing it! Very modern and intriguing. But the end felt flat. I also had a hard time getting attached to the characters (but the cast is great!) and for a 95 mins movie, I thought it was loooong. Too many conversations and not enough content about the hand itself. How did they learn to talk to that hand?I just think that my expectations were VERY high after reading the rave reviews. Maybe in a few years I will watch it again just confirm everything that I just said.",2023-09-16
"The teenager Mia (Sophie Wilde) misses her mother Rhea (Alexandria Steffensen), who died of pill overdose a couple of years ago. Now she is estranged of her father Max (Marcus Johnson), and lives with a family composed by her school mate and best friend Jade (Alexandra Jensen); her fifteen-year-old brother Riley (Joe Bird); and their mother Sue (Miranda Otto). One night, Mia, Jade and Riley go to a party hosted by their friends Hayley (Zoe Terakes) and Joss (Chris Alosio) to meet Jade's boyfriend and former Mia's crush Daniel (Otis Dhanji). Soon they learn that the attraction is a severed and embalmed hand of a clairvoyant that is capable to communicate with the spirits. There is a lit candle to guide the spirit, the person is tied to the chair and shall hold the hand, say ""talk to me"" and then ""I let you in"" to enable the spirit to possess his or her body. The most important is that the connection shall be interrupted before ninety seconds. Mia volunteers to the experiment and is excited with the experience and decides to repeat at Sue's home. However, this time the period of ninety seconds is exceeded, with tragic consequences to Riley, and Mia is haunted by the spirit of her mother that guides her. Or is she lured by an evil spirit?""Talk to Me"" (2022) is an effective Australian-British horror low-budget movie, with a simple but great story. The screenplay is well-written and holds the attention of the viewer to the very last scene. There are only a few special effects, only when necessary; therefore, the unknown cast succeeds to make the film work. Miranda Ottis performs only a supporting role and maybe is the most famous name in the cast. The conclusion is excellent and probably a sequel or a prequel or both will be made on the future. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Fale Comigo"" (""Talk to Me"")",2023-09-21
"Firstly this movie is great but what's more amazing is that I have watched RackaRacka for years on YT and now they are directors and nobody else more deserved !!! Well done on a FANTASTIC debut !!!The story is about a group of friends who play a game, not a game for the faint of heart, it is a clay hand that you hold and say ""Talk to me"" you then communicate with the dead and say ""I let you in"" and you have 90 seconds where the spirit takes control of the body. The main character Mia lost her mom 2 years ago and she starts seeing her and something evil happens. The rest of the movie is trying to escape the grasp of the spirits who don't want to leave.Hard to say without spoilers but a major event leads the course of the movie and my jaw DROPPED. The acting all around is AMAZING and the lead Sophie Wilde is fantastic, the supporting cast is great also, there are some moments with her dad I love especially a certain MOMENT !!!!It's a hair raising horror, not jammed with jumpscares or just scary faces but it pulls you in after something scary and jolts you again, suspense, classic RackaRacka gore, amazing practical effects makes for a great movie, definitely a cinema watch !! 8.5/10.",2023-07-31
"""Talk to Me"" follows a group of Adelaide teenagers who wind up in a supernatural vortex after playing a seance-adjacent party game; one that involves communicating with spirits via a mysterious ceramic-encased hand that allegedly belonged to a medium. Bad things happen, of course.This Australian effort is a slick and engrossing horror film from the Philippous (better known as RackaRacka), a pair of twin brother YouTubers who gained fame for their stunt and hijinx videos, but make no bones about it--both of them clearly know the genre, and perhaps more importantly, possess the skill to craft a feature that runs a slow, dread-inducing descent.The setup here is arbitrary at best, and takes heavy notes from films like ""The Evil Dead"" and ""The Exorcist"", but it uses its references wisely while still offering something different and gripping. The central protagonist, Mia, has a grim backstory that drives her interest in partaking in this paranormal parlor trick, to her own detriment. Her best friend, Jade, and Jade's younger brother, Riley, become enveloped in the mayhem that ensues after, leaving utter devastation in its wake.Unlike in a number of horror films, ""Talk to Me"" treats its teenage characters with a sense of realism rather than sketching them as pure archetypes, and its approach to the theme of grief never fully overrides the paranormal threat lurking at the center of the story. The performances here are uniformly commendable from all involved, especially from Sophie Wilde, Alexandra Jensen, Joe Bird, and Miranda Otto.Perhaps more than anything, though, ""Talk to Me"" succeeds because it is smartly plotted and maintains a constant sense of dread that is unshakeable. Even amidst its most unbelievable and oddball elements, there is just enough human gravitas to keep you entrenched in a state where it seems anything could happen--and probably for the worst. 8/10.",2023-07-28
"The ""When media overhypes a horror movie saying it's SOOO TERRIFYING, ONE OF THE SCARIEST FILMS EVER/OF THE YEAR/(ADD VARIANT), it'll most probably be mid"" rule never fails.Keeping in mind that the directors aren't professional filmmakers, just youtubers who make horror content, I guess it's a decent debut. But don't go expecting something innovative or mind blowing.It's gory, the makeup effects are cool, but in general it's kinda bland and predictable. A group of friends start fooling around with the occult, everybody laughs, things go south, nobody's laughing anymore, time to get to the bottom of this, yada yada yada.5/10.",2023-08-11
"'Talk to Me' tells the story of best friends Mia (Sophie Wilde) and Jade (Alexandra Jensen), who are dared to touch the disembodied and embalmed hand of a spiritual medium, and perform a short ritual, thereby allowing themselves to be possessed by spirits. With each turn of the hand, Mia, Jade, Hayley (Zoe Terakes), Joss (Chris Alosio), and Daniel (Otis Dhanji) experience 90 seconds of wildly varying spiritual possessions, but when Jade's brother Riley (Joe Bird) has a go at the hand, things become dark and excessively violent.Firstly, the acting is very well done, especially by the kids, Sophie Wilde and Joe Bird, who are front and center in the possession effects. The nature of Hayley and Joss being high school-ish punks and the double-dog-dare mentality of what is essentially putting ones' hands on a ouija board lends a lot of credibility and plausibility to the overall setup.The film does take a little bit to pick up after the opening scene, but once it does, the flow is good and doesn't lull anywhere for too long. The biggest win in this film is it doesn't rely on jump scares and instead, lets you sit in the fear, marinating in suspense.Definitely worth a watch!",2023-09-14
"Perhaps the surprise of the summer, ""Talk to Me"" is the best horror movie released so far in 2023 - which is somewhat of a shock for me to say. Though I had high hopes due to the A24 production label, I do have to say that most horror films nowadays have disappointed me due to their lack of originality and uninspired, formulaic structure. And while ""Talk to Me"" isn't the most original film out there, it is certainly inspired, leading to an appropriately creepy and shockingly disturbing film that is equally as scary as it is fun.From the beginning, ""Talk to Me"" brings the energy with a kinetic opening sequence taking place at a house party; music blares as a man makes his way through partygoers, pushing, shoving, and otherwise stopping at nothing to find whatever, or whoever, he is looking for. Tension builds, horror creeps in, and combined with a surprising finale to this bombastic introduction, the start is fittingly entertaining and sets the tone for what's to come. And what is to come? A really smooth combination of horror and entertainment-value.You see, ""Talk to Me"" is scary, but not in a jump-scare sort of way. In fact, I don't recall any real jump-scares in this movie besides one - and I was sober while watching this, so my recall is in tip-top shape (though I can't promise that I'm sober while writing this review). ""Talk to Me"" builds tension through its slick visual style, bursts of shocking violence, and in what it chooses to show - and not show - its viewers. For example, there are sequences where characters engage in the occult ritual that are frightening because the movie decides to depict what supernatural elements are at play; even more terrifying, however, are the ritual sequences that may not depict exactly what is going on, leaving it all up to your imagination to fill in the blanks. It's extremely effective and had me literally biting my nails. And as I mentioned, there is some violence in this film; usually blood and gore doesn't scare me, but in ""Talk to Me,"" the violence was so unexpected and graphic that at points I had to look away from the screen due to the visceral nature of what was occurring. And it's been some time since violence scared me, and it's been some time since I was forced to peek thru my fingers at a film - so I consider this a huge plus.""Talk to Me"" is also elevated by the writing, acting, and character development at play here; what I really enjoyed about this movie is just how entertaining and likable each and every one of the characters were, even if they weren't exactly the best of people, if that makes sense. Like, I recognize that some characters are jerks, and cause nothing but trouble wherever they go - however, the way they were played by the actors, and their lines of dialogue and all around development, had me smiling from ear to ear due to how much fun I had watching them interact. The writing is also really clever, with some fun party-going sequences that counteract against the horror, and characters that talk and act like real people. Both the actors in front of the camera, and the talent behind the camera, seemed to be really inspired while making this movie, and it shows - no one is not taking it seriously, and there's a lack of cringe-worthy elements that so many modern day horror movies have.I honestly really enjoyed this movie, and the more I think about it, the more I like it; in fact, I can't really think of any negatives, except that perhaps the pacing isn't quite as tight as I wanted it to be. Other than that, there's so much to enjoy here that I bumped up my original score from an 8 to a 9. ""Talk to Me"" is fun, it's scary, it's disturbing, and it's everything you could want from a horror film.",2023-07-29
"A new viral craze has begun. You and your friends at a party, phones up; you grab onto a creepy ceramic hand and speak the fateful words. It's all fun and games until the kids get careless and forget to close the door to the spirit world. Centering around a marvelous performance from Sophie Wilde as Mia, and her friends, brother and sister Jade and Riley who becomes caught up in the game; the young cast amply displays what can go wrong when kids push their friends into dangerous situations. In lesser hands (see what I did there?) this could have been a routine and sleepy feature, but I'm pleased to report first time filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou do wonders with this sharply written screenplay. Should keep viewers attention, with some truly surprising and scary moments, Talk to Me works works it's spell on a visceral level, without CG tricks, with an original idea, and is highly recommended.",2023-10-08
"No depth to it. At all.In my opinion there's one word that can sum it up and that's... 'Muh'
I should've known better than to get excited over a new horror film.I honestly can't remember the last time I actually enjoyed one.I think it might be time to 'literally' give up the ghost!!I'm quite surprised it wasn't a mobile App that they used to communicate with the dead ha!The whole story and the characters were just skimmed across the top.The first scene was the best part right before the credits, so all that does is make me feel even more cheated ha!Gutted.I've watched some wicked A24 films tho but this isn't one of them.",2023-09-17
"In all honesty, I've watched a lot of thrillers and horror movies and this hits the mark at a 6. It's nothing you haven't seen before, the movie isn't particularly scary either.It's a decent flick, suits teenagers best who haven't seen this premise in a movie before. For us older folks it's an okay watch.There are some plot holes, I feel like the movie crashed midway through when the cops arrived at the house. And the acting isn't superb either, the filming was good and the story is all right (although it's nothing new, just a different concept with the hand instead of a board.)Interested in seeing what these directors can come up with next, hopefully something a bit more scarier than this.",2023-09-14
"This one has a stupid premise and it's shown in the most unbelievable way possible. The teenagers in here are shown to be dumber than the ones who tried the tide pod challenge. At least make them be a bit more serious. They're taking videos of the eery stuff they're doing and putting it in social media. Even when they know the danger behind the creepy stuff they do, they are all being cool about it. Doesn't make sense.The main characters were kind of boring. The sorrow of that main girl wasn't really shown effectively. But the acting was good. The graphics, photography and all those stuff were good.It wasn't even scary. Just a few scenes that were kind of tense. Nothing much interesting happens by the end too.It was not just boring, it was annoying too. Almost all the characters and the premise were annoying.",2023-09-17
"I had high hopes for the movie. I was particularly drawn to the idea of connecting with the departed, similar to the use of an Ouija board. However, the film left me deeply disappointed.Firstly, the characters fell flat. They lacked depth, which made it Impossible to care what happens to them. Secondly, the plot proved disappointingly simplistic. The film failed to deliver any real scares, relying instead on tired clichés in an attempt to create tension. I believe the only scary scene is the one in the toilet. Lastly, the production quality left much to be desired. The acting felt mediocre, the special effects seemed cheesy, and the makeup left me unconvinced.On a side note, the Australian accents of some cast members occasionally made the dialogue hard to follow.In summary, ""Talk to Me"" falls short of its acclaim. It's a tedious, predictable, and poorly executed film that I would advise avoiding at all costs.",2023-09-17
"The concept had me in the first place when I saw the reviews. I was so sure this will be the horror film that I had been craving for so long. But When I saw it, it got me really disappointed. Wanted to give it 1-star due to this disappointment but kept my emotions aside to rate it 4.I am not sure why did it got so much high ratings from critics and audience. I mean has the horror standard and expectations fallen so low that people rate this 7 or 8? I was left with wanting for more in terms of story.Acting was good but the story was poorly written. It could have been a short film of 20 mins instead. I am really disappointed by the execution of such a great concept. It had a potential of being one of those rare horror films which you want to see again and again. But the efforts by directors are not made.",2023-09-13
"Talk to Me has a narrative that's a bit overstuffed and has a handful of character and plot threads that aren't developed sufficiently. But this is a complaint that can be easily overlooked in light of the plethora of things this film gets right.It's familiar theme of grief is given a unique spin (at least for the horror genre) in that what's primarily explored is the tendency we have to believe in lies and succumb to manipulation when we're burdened with grief.It's really compelling stuff when this is the movie's focus, which is more often than not.The whole cast is great, but Sophie Wilde as Mia had me hooked from scene one and only continued to impress me afterward. Sold every emotion and reservation and is easily worthy of awards consideration, though it likely won't happen, sadly.The Philippou brothers directed the hell out of this. It's a darkly atmospheric horror film that, while kind of messy, is a more than satisfying spooky flick.",2023-07-29
This is the first horror film I have watched where I haven't cried because I was too scared and didn't leave or turn it off. This balances humor and pure terror while having an amazing and original concept. The cinematography in the final scene is amazing and the detail that went into the costuming is so brilliant. Watching the progression of the main character was honestly captivating and they way it was written was outstanding. I am a personal sucker for one shot takes and the first scene and last scene was a perfect example. I don't know if it was my cinema but I found that some of the props were maybe just a little too loud but other than that it was a stellar film. Brilliant psychological horror with amazing themes while still being unique. Will definitely be trying more horror films because of this.,2023-07-24
"Talk to Me: A rather disturbing and violent Australian horror film, from the opening sequence to it's end you will encounter shock after shock.. My one quibble with it is that the accents are difficult to understand at times and it would have benefited from subtitles! Teens summon up the spirits of the dead at parties, it's more than just a game, they expect it to work. They use a porcelain hand which supposedly contains an embalmed hand. There is a ritual to be gone through and you see the face of the spirit who you must then invite in. Mistakes happen and the spirits linger. Taking possession, being seen by those who went through the ritual. Some really effective/nauseating scenes where the spirits get the teens to commit self harm, thinking that they are combating a threat. Really akin to Japanese Angry Ghosts. The shape shifting nature of the spirits and their ability to fool the teens into thinking they are dead or even living loved ones is vividly portrayed. Great performances from a mostly young cast led by Sophie Wilde with Miranda Otto as the mother of two of the teens. A remarkable dark work of horror, one you will be mulling over long after the final credits roll. Directed by Danny and Michael Philippou, Written by Danny Philippou and Bill Hinzman. 8.5/10.",2023-08-03
This movie was not that good in real horror movie terms. It could've been but it got stuck in using one victim midway through the movie and ultimately slow burned it's way to the end. It's not scary and you won't be sick as some reviewers are leading you to believe. It's just an average indie movie that could've been better. The premier is fine and the ending is clever but that was predictable. Could've been scary... Could've built in more gore... Could've worked in more victims... It just didn't. It really started off with a bang and you thought you'd get more of that but nope! I'm sure they'll be a sequel because the storyline left you incomplete. Hope it's better than this one!,2023-08-12
"I don't really post reviews but since this is a movie that has a lot of hype, lately I want to say that its definitely a bit if not for certain overrated, it's confusing at times and especially towards the end.The backstory of the hand is never really explained that's something that the movie kinda missed on and again the decision making of the characters doesn't make sense, no one seems to be worried or concerned at the slightest about the origins of the hand, they just casually decide to do it and that's where the movie lost parts of its realism.The characters are basically very stereotypical again no realism in sight and I would say that you will unfortunately have to lower your expectations about it because in my opinion it's kind of overhyped and I have seen a lot of horror movies in my time.Don't get me wrong, the movie isn't bad just not what the reviewers are depecting, it could have been much better but this is what we got so we roll with it. Worth a watch but a little tiny bit overrated.",2023-09-14
"I'm I've been so excited waiting to watch this film, tidbits and teasers all over the place! The trailer looked fantastic, had a bit of everything.However, after watching I'm just a bit.......meh. A bit disappointed really.The film definitely a good premise and I guess a semi-solid film as 'horrors' go. But I didn't particularly warm to any of the characters (apart from the young'un) so I felt it was lacking there. There was a little back story but I found that I also didn't care about that either.We didn't get any closure regarding the 'Dad' and also, the scene with the dog made my stomach turn. The film was obviously not going for 'shock value' so that was completely out of place.By the end I was just bored. And the 'twist'? Not very twisty at all.I'm definitely expecting that once this film is more widely available the 7.5 rating to dip to maybe a 4.2....at a push.",2023-09-14

Even the movie ends without any explanation.Tastes are different, but this is hardly overrated.The actors done an ok job, but the writing was more horrible than the movie itself.Depending on the rating, it must be way better than the first installment of Insidious, and Insidious wipes the floor with Talk to me.Even Dark Skies has a lower rating and its way better than this joke article of a horror movie here.Definately not the worst i have seen, but its not good.",2023-09-18
"The hype train around this movie was pretty big considering the tiny budget ($4.5m) and lack of star power in front of the camera, with the trailers promising a new take on horror from the first time Aussie directors.What was delivered however, was a lacklustre, by the numbers tale of yet another group of instantly hateable teens making contact with the other side and unable to close the door, leading to various scares and thrills as they escape peril (or not)This movie hits every checkbox along the way without adding anything new or exciting to an already bloated genre. The hand simply replaces the standard conduit (Ouija board, mirror, book etc) for spiritual activity. Even the scares themselves are poorly conceived and lacking tension and gore. (Apart from one scene with Riley)The characters are nothing more than shallow cutouts, made even harder to feel empathy with given how spiteful and truly annoying they all are. Only Miranda Otto (Mum) and. Joe Bird (Riley) rise above with solid performances from what little material they were given.When it becomes apparent that this is yet another rehash of well trodden horror territory, it then becomes all too predictable and this is where the directors lose face. They add nothing to justify the hype around them. No flourish or signs that they can handle even the most basic of movie templates with creativity or provide a new ""vision"" on something that most of us have already seen before.Where I will give the film some credit is on its sound design and mixing which was really solid.There are hints of a better, more interesting story scattered throughout that are never built upon. Themes of suicide, expression of grief, technology and the family unit are touched on but unexplored, leaving the viewer with an unsatisified conclusion come the finale.A finale which is indeed the most interesting and engaging part of the film, sadly only lasts 90 seconds and serves as a reminder of an opporrtunity missed.4.5/10.",2023-09-14

"Greetings from Lithuania.""Talk to me"" (2022) was a highly entertaining and bloody horror movie. At some points it was as funny as any movie I've seen in some time, but in a good way. It's a very bloody and kinda disturbing movie but not a gore fest, and I love it. The plot was good and involving. It's like a mash up of Exorcist and Sam Raimi - no spoilers but this movie surprised me in a good way. Performances were excellent and it's a key thing to success of this movie - it easily could have collapsed yet superb acting, amazing make up and very solid directing carried this movie beyond its otherwise silly premise.Overall, ""Talk to me"" is a very good movie, superbly paced, never boring and it does it's job superbly. Can't wait for the sequel.",2023-08-25
You can't creat a narrative around such depressing obnoxious and utterly pointless characters. The horror would have been great if I'd given a toss about a single one of them.Let me get this straight.You witness something marvellous and unique and your immediate reaction is to get hysterical with laughter.I'm an enormous horror fan. But the writing is dreadful. The concept is great. But the execution is simply foul. There wasn't one character in it that I didn't want to get eaten alive by rodents. They were all awful.Compare it to Babadook or It Follows and you're left cold.Won't be watching this again. Ever.,2023-09-12

"""Talk to Me"" has been touted as the horror movie phenomenon of the year (its premiere in its native Australia was last year) and it falls short, it's so much more, a visual delight and adrenaline rush. The script takes elements from ""Ringu"" and ""It Follows"" but adds its own refreshing originality, offering an art-house horror film without cheap jump scares. The cinematography is a visual delight, plus it creates a murky atmosphere. The performances of the entire cast are realistic and intense, mainly those of Sophie Wilde and Miranda Otto. The musical composition will become a classic for those of us who are fans of the genre. The makeup effects are gloomy, achieving an excellent old-school air. The audio design is excellent and adds to the suspense factor. The direction of the brothers Danny and Michael Philippou is majestic, together they achieve an innovative film and a great modern classic within horror cinema.

"Well, I thought: ""Australian horror, what can go wrong""? After ""Lake Mungo"" and Babadook""? But then I've watched that movie...
There is a kind of game between teens. You hold the hand and say ""Talk to me"" and it let you see the ghosts.Mia just losted her mum, and feel depressed. But she is also an annoying brat concentrated on herself. She didn't help dying animal, she let young boy to risk his life, she is flirting with her bestie's boyfriend. I understand grif, but acting like that is not normal.I couldn't feel sorry for her.About the story, idea is not so original. Difference? In US movies you have Quija board instead of plaster hand. Another movie with group of friends and during the experiment something went wrong. Ghost are not so scary, mostly repulsive. If you like CGI, you'll be disappointed. Acting is like in some B class movie.To end this review, if you want to watch it, do it only for fun. You want be scared, there's nothing to be afraid.",2023-09-09

"Just came back from cinema, and its over rated and same old formula flick. Nothing new , but this time the prop was a plastic hand Dont know how movies got these ratings , but now i believe that they hire an agency to pump up review rating. Acting was okay , this could be a short twilight zone episode which was stretched into a full length movie.Its truth or dare mixed with 13 ghosts and few other flicks and here you go with a movie.So i wont recommend you to go, spend your hard earned money and watch it in cinema, instead wait and watch at home.Its a movie you soon will forget, so even if you are not going to watch this one , there will be no impact on your life or imagination.",2023-08-20
"I really wanted to like this movie; good horror films are so hard to find. Unfortunately, this was not a good horror (or even a good film). It started out shallow and irritating, but hey - I had sunk money into watching (most readers will know what that means), so I stuck with it, hoping that the story would improve as it went on.Sadly, it was not to be. The annoying, facile leads persisted in their stupidity; the older ""authority"" figures barely registered as characters, fluctuating between awkward permissive enabling and half-hearted scolding of the protagonists, depending on the severity of the situation.In short, this is a threadbare, glib rehash of every horror trope from The Monkey's Paw to Hill House, with none of the character development, depth or humanity that defined those masterpieces. It's a cheap knockoff that ultimately culminates in a victim story; no conclusion, no satisfying payoff - just a predictable ""twist"" that the filmmakers apparently felt justifies the whole contrived mess. It doesn't.",2023-09-16
"Coming from A24, the same studio behind great indie horror like Hereditary, The Witch and Midsommar have people claiming it's just as good and just as ""scary"" as those movies. It's not.While I didn't find the jump scares to be effective, I did think the gorier bits worked well and the whole movie, predictable as it was, did have an unnerving tone especially leading up to the game going off the supernatural rails.I can see why younger horror fans would think this is a fantastic movie, as horror movies go it will definitely strike a chord with teenage audiences but like Veronica I don't think this movie is as ""brilliant"" as it's being made out to be, especially when films like It Follows carries a similar tone but a much more effective execution.",2023-08-03
"Orinality, reminded me to 70's horror films, where they didn't want to make a repeated horror film with a long black hair little girl wearing a white dirty dress, like 99% of horror films in the last 2 decades, well, THERE ISNT A long black hair little girl wearing a white dirty dress IN THIS FILM!!!!! ALLELUYAH!!!!! Also, the originality was something we haven't seen in many decades, the practical effects instead of excess of CGI makes the movie stand out above all the other horror films where CGI use makes the movies look more like a Dolce Gabanna fashion show than a horror film, the acting was also on point, the color grading fantastic, good drama, solid script, very creepy and terrifying, it has everything to become a whole franchise, I hasten to say a few names to upcoming sequels: ""Dont talk to me"" ""Talk to us"" ""Talk to them"" ""Talk""",2023-09-15
"The movie was ok. Acting was fine. But holy hell, the story was beyond stupid. You see dead people and you actually let them in you? Yup nothing can go wrong. Are people really that stupid? It made the movie very irritating to watch. And what does it matter if you are under 18. Theres rules to this hand? The kid starts banging his head and no one tried to pull the hand away? Why only one girl seeing things. They did this many times. REally stupid things. And then the stupid girl does it by herself? She just saw what happened to the other kid and she does it again? Holy hell. Stupid people. Stupid movie.",2023-09-16
"A movie not for the faint hearted, we've had the movie 'Smile' and 'Barbarian' and in 2023 we have the brutal hard to watch blood soaked horror fest, leaving you feel traumatised just like it's source material, instead of a traditional 'ouija board' we have a hand of a corpse that's been set in ceramic casing and once held, a small ritual takes place to reconnect with the dead, leaving you possessed it's a stand out movie that made me gasp in shock, a brilliant plot and with a great unknown cast... An Australian cult classic in the making, I never feel jumpy with these sort of movies but this totally gripped me and waiting for the next standout scare, brilliant!",2023-08-16
"Absolutely hated it. No idea why this is getting so many good reviews. I really wanted to give Youtubers doing their feature debut the benefit of a doubt but I am SOO tired of these same teenage trope movies in current horror movies. As soon as the Sidemen appeared in the cameo it just felt like Youtubers doing a horror movie. People calling this the best horror of 2023 just shows how poor the horror landscape in cinema is nowadays. It is no where near the level of Hereditary. I know they're trying to appeal to gen-z but it's just the same old feeling. Music choices that just takes you out of any form of tension. Why can't someone make a good ol' scary movie without any comedic tropes or witty one liners. The only good bits were just a straight rip off of Hereditary.Characters they introduced were just phased out. . Final act just ended abruptly. Payoff was unbelievably disappointing. Feel like people reviewing this are all gen-z horror babies who are all giving Oppenheimer 1 star at the moment because they didn't get it.The only form of discussion me and my brother got from it is the fear of taking too much drugs and not remembering anything from it, but that just wasn't fleshed out in any truly terrifying way, and just kind of made a mockery of it.",2023-08-11
"A creative new take on an ouija board with so much more to say !I loved the concept of the hand it was so new and original , yet the movie still holds that idea of what can happen when u don't close ""the door"" .I would highly recommend this movie to friends to see , it's majorly creepy but still entertaining and a gripping story . Everyone gives a pretty good performance but Sophie Wilde is really impressive in her role , it's role that would've required for you to have a lot of confidence and talent all of which she portrays on screen with such bold brilliance.I believe she will be cast in a lot of movies in the future.I also want to give credit to the directors.Danny Philippou, Michael Philippou .This was brilliant please make more movies !",2023-07-29
"Wow I loved this film. This horror knocked it out of the water for me and is a 10/10- I was scared. I've seen a lot of horror films and lately find I'm a fan of modern horror that embodies some elements of the times we live in: social media, going viral, cell phones ringing in a silent room, eerie pinging of a text message. The two that spring to mind are Slenderman and It Follows, where it's shallow teens not realizing the danger that awaits them. This was modern horror in all its glory. I watched this film because the hand reminded me of one of my favourite horror books, The Cipher by Kathe Koja. It did not disappoint. The Aussie actors were nothing short of incredible, there was such character and grittiness in each and every one of them, particularly in the friendship group. Props to the main girl (she was amazing) her best friend and the best friends brother. Even the mum was great. Real acting. Depth. Character. Emotion. Rawness. Even the ones that were intentionally game and shallow, they had you convinced. A real, original story and some terrifying scenes that left you stone cold. I truly loved the ending, I haven't stopped hyping up this film since I watched it.",2023-09-23
"Wow, wow, wow! As expected from A24 studio! This movie has been on my watchlist since they announced about their new horror movie, and i am so happy they delivered the movie so well!The idea is original, the storyline is good (a tiny bit cliche here and there, but understandable), the acting is top notch considering i have never seen the actors before and but they are impressive!This is the exact definition of teenagers being teenagers with scary consequences.Overall, the movie is very enjoyable, good drama, good make up, good effect, and good music. Highly recommended, something scary that you can enjoy without being stressful during and after the show.",2023-09-06
"You've watched the trailer, so you know what this movie is about. Good acting but a fantastic idea in a genre that is generally just clichéd rehashed rubbish - dont get me wrong, i love a good horror but the cliches are just boring. The only clichéd is the final scene, which seemed to me to be more of a shout out to the horror genre than a sequel generation.There has been some hype about this film amd it is deserved but the concept is what sold me. Cabin in the Woods, Haunting of Hill House and Hereditary and now this movie all used some imagination instead of the tired overused ideas... This was a breathe of fresh air.",2023-10-27
"This film is a gem, one you won't hear off till the trailer and then be shocked how good it is, the amount of Australian shows and films I've watched that have been absolute genius is astounding this is just the perfect horror.It's a film that feels like it could easily manifest into a franchise and potentially leads that way but for the first time in so long I left desperately hoping there's more of these, there are not many horrors this well thought out and acted.I don't mean to be singular focused here the cast are great but Sophie Wilde, what a performance, absolutely captivating, she's beautiful, she looks of African heritage but has beautiful features and expressions and her acting is just flawless, I love horror and I can't recall a better single performance.The story is great, it feels real, possible although ridiculous, no loose threads, everything is so perfectly wrapped up, there's one seen that was so brutal it even made me gasp.Perfection.",2023-07-29
"Not even close to a horror movie, the trailer made it seem more interesting than it actually it, it looked like,murder and terrifying activity but it's just a woke fest.Characters are unlikeable and pathetic.I would not recommend this unless you're part of the group who support this crap.I can't even go where this movie treads, I'm surprised this made it out of the editing room, I was waiting for something to happen but it just didn't, if I didn't know any better I'd say it was made by woke Disney. Just watch the trailer, it's the only part of this thing that is ok.Stuff like this should not be allowed, it's why society is crumbling.",2023-09-16
"Though the movie seemed to start on a good note it failed to keep audience enthralled throughout. Overall the real "" horror"" content was merely 20% of the entire runtime...
Felt like director wasted first 30 min just to lay the foundation as if he is saying ""well horror will just begin shortly, have patience""
I've been a big fan of english horror movies as they really bring out the eerie factor through the direction but this one lacked the punch.If you compare it with movies of the same genre, eg lights out..it stands nowhere
This movie seemed to be a B grader horror movie..
Failed to impress..",2023-08-14
"Being an avid horror fan, I always look forward to new horror movies! This one had me very intrigued with the high ratings and people commenting that they had to walk out of the theater. Wait what? Did I see the wrong movie?A lot of possession type movies where evil spirits are involved, can be creepy. But this movie didn't do it for me.Despite having ONE intense scene, this movie was far from scary.I seriously almost stopped watching it because the movie started super slow. I did continue,hoping it would be great knowing it scared so many people.The concept of this movie seems pretty cool but it did not deliver at all!",2023-09-14
"Talk to Me is a horror movie that delivers on its promise of scares, suspense and gore. The film, directed by Danny Philippou and Michael Philippou, follows a group of friends who discover how to conjure spirits using an embalmed hand. They become addicted to the thrill of contacting the dead, until one of them goes too far and unleashes a deadly curse.The film is a homage to classic horror movies like The Evil Dead, The Exorcist and Poltergeist, but with a modern twist. The film uses practical effects and makeup to create realistic and horrifying creatures, rather than relying on CGI. The film also explores the themes of obsession, addiction and peer pressure, as the characters are drawn into a dangerous game that they can't escape.The film features a talented cast of young actors, led by Sophie Wilde as Mia, the protagonist who tries to stop the curse. She is joined by Joe Bird as Riley, her boyfriend who is skeptical of the seance; Alexandra Jensen as Jade, her best friend who is obsessed with the hand; Otis Dhanji as Daniel, Jade's brother who is curious about the occult; and Marcus Johnson as Max, the prankster who initiates the ritual. Miranda Otto also stars as Sue, Mia's mother who has a dark secret.Talk to Me is a must-see for horror fans who enjoy a good scare and a gripping story. The film is distributed by A24, the studio behind acclaimed horror films like Hereditary, Midsommar and The Witch. The film has received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike, earning a 97% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes1.",2023-07-12
"What's scary about this movie is how sad it is. If you like horror movies that make you feel sad and sick and disappointed in humanity, you might like this one.The directing and acting was excellent, don't get me wrong. The lead character was brilliantly wicked and scary, but at the same time so utterly miserable, that I felt uncomfortable. I don't know who I was supposed to side with or feel for here, because as we all know, it's usually the main character. But I would never ever want to side with anyone like Mia.The story was just plain amoral and depressing. If I were gen Z, I might actually feel offended, because this film made me frustrated with them.",2023-09-03
"I almost could've seen a little sooner but had a recent birthday of 31st and glad I got to see this several days later. This hit the spot with the directing being amazing, the characters are worth watching, great vibes, and genius horror some of the best I've seen in awhile! I loved Talk to Me I'll definitely want to own when available. For something based around a game you'd think the movie wouldn't be that good like Truth or Dare but this is masterful it's unique, effed up, and keeps you interested throughout. I don't even laugh at horror like some do I get effected by it and sync into the disturbing elements I crave them which might not be healthy yet great for fans of the genre!",2023-08-09
"I really love horror movies. This had an amazing premise. I loved the ghosts. They were very well crafted and scary especially when each person initially grabs the hand. The cast and acting are phenomenal. But the violence and gore in this movie seemed highly unnecessary. I wish they had made it more psychological. The brother scene seemed way overboard and meant to just be shocking without any value.But let's cut to the scene where Mia inadvertently stabs her dad. We've scene this same cliche a million times where the ghosts make people think her father is some evil figure, and then they kill said father. I've seen this done so many times. They could have done without that, and it didn't serve much purpose except for her friend to have some sort of notification that Mia had gone off the deep end.The ending was nice, again a little cliche, more like the Ouija stuff where the protagonist eventually is trapped with the rest of the ghosts in the hand. The fact that she comes back to possess someone else at a party was interesting.Obviously, they didn't delve too deep into the history of the hand itself, because they intend sequels or a trilogy. But I can see this starting to spin out of control, where there will be more and more violence in each movie after this that tries to outdo the previous one and be more shocking. I hope they focus more on the story here next time and move away from the endless bloodletting.",2023-09-17
"Talk to Me is, in this wave of trite, standard horror stories repeated incessantly, a surprisingly refreshing story with the appropriate grisly touches. Talk To Me is different in that it does not fall into the normal trappings of a horror story involving a ghost haunting a house. The concept is intriguing, involving an embalmed hand, and lots of pretty gory and gruesome effects. These effects look quite real and practical, and are a real achievement. What is not as thrilling about Talk to Me however is that it is a pretty loose narrative strung together. It involves a main character wanting to communicate with her deceased mother, and this sub plot sometimes takes up too much screen time. The pacing of the film suffers from this- this film definitely feels longer than it's 90 minute runtime. This strength of this film is hence this- that it has an interesting premise, and impressive special effects- it is certainly more gruesome then scary, and there are no jump scares. It is the appalling, unexpected moments of graphic detail which stuns the audience rather than an atmosphere of tension and horror Culminating in a jump scare. But that does not deter its allure- for movie audiences who like to be surprised, talk to me is pretty good stuff indeed.",2023-07-28
"First of all this movie was a waste of time, it was pointless, horrendous and not enjoyable just pure bad acting and no plot. The goal for a horror movie is to be scary and this movie was not even close to an scary movie, Zoe Terakes was the worst, but he did not get it in theaters and was not a horror film at the same level of comedy that the film had in mind in its original incarnation of Star Trek and Star Wars was in its final form and it is still in its final year in the making of the film as it was in the series and is currently in the final season in its second year of its second year on Netflix.",2023-08-09
"I watch a lot of horror movies and it's rare they leave a mark on me like a drama would, but this movie is different.It sucks you in and makes you totally empathise with the characters before taking you on an insane roller coaster ride of violence and terror.The horror 'scenes' aren't run of the mill jump scares, they are methodical and well placed. And this is not a run of the mill horror movie, this is a psychological twisted film.The whole movie had me feeling uneasy throughout, so I knew it had done a good job.It doesn't just give you surface scares but gets into your head and really makes you think.And the ending... go watch this movie if you're a fan of horror. If you aren't a fan of horror I'd avoid as it is not for feint of heart, coming from a horror film buff! This is genuinely scary!",2023-07-28
"Well I was hoping for a good horror film, but yet again the hype and this modern way of making movies hit and runied it. Let's get this generation satisfied then LGBTQ let's just tick the boxes then think about doing the film. Oh no, it's just horrid, the characters are stupid and annoying. The idea is ok and should have been much better but it seems no thought went into plot story and plasability. Drags over to the left and just doesn't bother trying to be scary, it's not a touch on the horrors of the 70s and 80s, what happened why all this total rubbish instead of some good old fashioned horror films. I would give this a miss to be honest you won't be losing anything.",2023-10-26
"I've rated this movie a 7 because as others said it feels completely new and fresh for the horror genre, something that doesn't happen often in the is genre and is a nice surprise. Most horror movies are low rated even for decent flicks but this one deserves points for originality, new young cast, looks polished on a shoestring budget.Takes a while to get going but I love the buildup and mythology of the hand. It's a great idea and reminds me of the monkey paw that grants wishes... kinda.First half is much better than the second half, that hurts so many horror movies. They don't know where to go and end up showing too much which takes away the creep factor.I'll probably watch the last 20 mins again as I feel like I missed some of it. But it deserves your time if your a hard core horror lover you'll appreciate this for it's originality... and being a nice little movie out of Australia.",2023-09-17
"Generally speaking horror films tend to be derivative. There's nothing wrong with that but without keen vision and direction the film can just be lame, which is pretty much where this ended up. <-- That's my review.Modern Horror Movies: The Rise and Fall of a Genre
Abstract: The horror movie genre appears to be slowly declining, with many films being criticized as unoriginal and uninventive. But is this fair? It may be time for horror movies to evolve, as they have done throughout history.In recent years, some horror movies have been criticized as unoriginal and uninventive. This may be true to some extent, but it is also important to remember that horror is a diverse genre that has evolved throughout history.",2023-09-15
"Horror is undoubtedly one of the tougher genres to do anything new or even to get away from the usual tropes.Amd unfortunately , Talk to Me , doesn't do anything new. While it is somewhat entertaining the cast is made up of characters that the audience is never really given time to care about, the closest it came to expanding on one was with the films lead, Sophie Wilde, whom without the film would have been a lot worse off. She shines in the lead, and pretty much carries a band of ""also rans"" for the entire 1 hour 30 odd minutes.A lack lustre vision from the directors leave a feeling of what might have been , from an otherwise mediocre outing, a budget of 4.5 million is absolutely visible, contrary to many saying it looked like a much higher budget yarn. Its not. Its a low budget horror. And that's it.While it will pass an evening on a Halloween night, it's certainly nit going to be a regular Halloween go to, and I've a feeling this will soon be forgotten about.Watch it, with low expectations , and you should be fine.",2023-09-18
It was so bad we left the theater. It was slow to start. They did a horrible job introducing the characters. I know the budget was low but the effects and story line was awful.This could have been a really good movie if done right. They thought behind what could have been a good plot was there they just didn't get there with it. It's a shame it wasn't.And maybe it all tied together at the end but the opening scene has nothing to do with the movies plot.Like I said about the time the guy French kissed the dog we left because we couldn't take the insanity of it anymore.Wait for it to be on prime. Don't waste your money.,2023-07-29
"Talk To Me is a horror movie that builds itself up on a great premise but falls a bit flat on its finale. Recommendable, but could have been better. Understand why reading along.In Talk To Me, a seemingly unharmful game has serious consequences, borrowing a lot on the concept of Ouija boards. One creepy hand opens the door to talk to the dead, and a group of youngsters from the current generation is mocking the outcomes that this powerful artifact might bring, talking to the dead like some twisted game. The fun part is that I could definitely see this happening in modern times - how many times haven't we seen some sad news about some kid that got hurt or worse due to some dumb challenge?The opening seen and the setup are great. Creepy and intense, great acting by Sophie Wilde, which interprets character Mia, a girl trying to go over her mother's death. You get your fair share of what you'll get on this movie; or is it? The major problem of Talk To Me is that it builds expectations to the highest but the movie decreases in tone as it progresses, slowly fading into light horror territory. When we get to Act 2, we are stuck with a good story that lacks what Act 1 had: good horror. The middle-point scene is great, kudos to actor Jor Bird, but it's not the real middle plot point.The plot point at the middle that sets the ticking clock happens a bit late, but it's a good one, creepy in its own way. However, by this point, you start to wander if you get some answers - for questions that I can only go in depth later, on the spoiler part of this review. Bottom line, you kinda don't.Stakes are high at this point, and you want a good finale to wrap things up. And, although the ending scene is interesting to the point that opens up the path to possible sequels, too many things are left open with the main plotline, which feels unsatisfactory.Talk To Me is recommendable to horror fans, even with these flaws. Hopefully, one possible sequel might close some of the loose knots.*** From this point on, spoilers! Spoilers! Be advised...Talk To Me builds itself around Mia, mourning her mother's recent death, to which the movie tries to build suspense, but it's fair straight that her mother committed suicide. But I feel sad that, because of constraints on movies, writers couldn't build other characters from what I will call moving forward the Hand Group. The Hand Group has some interesting characters that could contribute to the story in good IT vibes, but, in the end, we focus only on Mia and her arc, a negative arc that leaves a sour taste on our mouth; the lack of some other main character with a positive arc is dissatisfactory.So, breaking into Act 2 reveals that Riley, for unexplained reasons, has caught the attention of the spirits, some mean ones that want to tear him apart. When they get their hands on Riley due to Mia's selfish act to try to connect to her mother, stakes ramp up good, but we start wondering: what's with wanting Riley so bad. No explanations.Another problem is that Mia is the only one seeing spirits. In the story, they try to explain this fact with a dialog where Mia suggests that she was the only one that touched the hand along with Riley - the movie even tries to corroborate this fact -, but it feels weird.No back info on the hand might be a trick to suggest a follow-up movie. Okay, but, if not, then there is this huge flaw too.To wrap up, the ending. So, Mia and Riley has this encounter with a dying hit-and-runned-down kangaroo on the road. Mia opts to let the agonizing kangaroo die out of his misery; ""huge mistake!?"" Well... At the end, this fact hunts Mia to the point where she realizes that she must kill Riley by throwing him at some speeding car - so dumb. Then, she actually commits suicide and that apparently saves Riley!? Why? How? We get nothing. This is a huge turndown to what could have been a great horror movie.",2023-09-24
"Having seen the RackaRacka duo work on their effects for years online, I bought advance screening tickets just to see how they improve with a budget and what an incredible step up!The effects look amazing, the character designs are genuinely haunting, and the story is incredible.Don't worry if you're not a huge fan of jump scares, this isn't one of those films that use them like it's a life support. Much of the suspense is maintained through the performance of the actors, which remains unreal throughout. You can see the fear develop through expressions, and feel the atmosphere of the scene in your seat.The story does not disappoint, going in a different direction than expectation multiple times and leaving the plot feeling fresh, rather than out of a mold.Will definitely be seeing again, so happy to have a great addition to Aussie horror. I hope they make a slasher next, those effects are made for it!",2023-07-14
"I've always been a big fan of Danny and Michael Phillippou's Youtube channel and when I heard that these guys are about to make a horror movie I was more than excited. Now that I've finally seen the movie I can say that I really liked it but all these positive reviews made the movie overall underwhelming. It basically followed the usual formula but with some nice visuals and smart directing choices. But even though I had a great experience watching this movie for me personally it didn't stand out as much as most people said it would. Like in many movies of this kind the main character had a traumatic loss in her past, we had teenagers doing some dumb ritual or game and getting in trouble because of a stupid decision and we had a character that our protagonists meet who has dealt with this kind of evil before. However the Philippou brothers managed to entertain for 95 minutes enough so that I would still give this movie 7/10. I also might be biased a little because I knew their work on YouTube before.

"This is a movie that I started to hear buzz about right as it was getting released wide. My wife saw a trailer and was freaked out by it. That made me excited to see this. I did hear in a group chat that I'm in that there were story elements they were tired of seeing used. For the rest of what I've been hearing, most people are high on this film. I've heard some go as far to say this could be a year-end contender.Synopsis: when a group of friends discover how to conjure spirits using an embalmed hand, they become hooked on the new thrill, until one of them goes too far and unleashes terrifying supernatural forces.Now I'll admit something upon writing this, I saw this in the theater on Saturday and sat down to review it on Monday morning. We start where Cole (Ari McCarthy) is looking for his brother, Duckett (Sunny Johnson) at a party. It seems the latter had a breakdown and he's been dealing with heavy stuff. This ends in tragedy, making it that much more heartbreaking.It is from here that we meet our lead, Mia (Sophie Wilde). She is dealing with heavy things. Her mother committed suicide, but she doesn't believe it. She is convinced it was an accident and they didn't get to her in time. Her father and her estranged due to it. He won't tell the truth, according to her. Mia has latched on to her best friend, Jade (Alexandra Jensen), and her family. She sees Riley (Joe Bird) as a brother and Sue (Miranda Otto) as another mother. Riley calls Mia to pick him up as Jade won't answer.These three kids sneak off to a party and Sue knows about it. She just wants them to be safe. It is at this party we meet Jade's boyfriend of Daniel (Otis Dhanji). We learn that he's straight edge and briefly was Mia's boyfriend previously. These kids play a game at these parties. Jade doesn't believe it and Mia is intrigued. Hayley (Zoe Terakes) and Joss (Chris Alosio) have the embalmed hand from the synopsis.They claim it is from a medium and set in plaster. The game is that they strap you to a chair. They light a candle to open the door and then you say, 'Talk to Me'. This makes a ghost appear to you when hold the hand. If you then allow it inside, this spirit possesses you and you function as well as look strange. You're only supposed to let the entity stay inside you for 90 seconds. Anything longer, it might like it.Mia is the first one to do this at the party. Those in attendance feel awkward around her after what she's gone through and how it affected her. She allows a spirit inside of her but something doesn't go right. It stays just longer than the time frame when Joss can't get the hand from her. She then becomes addicted to doing this. Jade even allows her, Daniel, Riley, his friend to host Hayley and Joss in doing this. It results in disaster though when Riley is hospitalized and in a coma. No matter what they do to fix it, it just seems to complicate the situation even farther.That is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. Where I want to start is that I was shocked to see that this is an A24 film. Upon completion, I'm not anymore. This does feel like they are trying to go a bit more mainstream with a darker take on something that Blumhouse would come out with. This exceeds most everything I've seen though from the latter company though.Now that I've set that up, I want to first delve into the lead of Mia. I know there are people out there that are over the trauma narrative. I can see their gripe with our lead. Her mother killed herself and it is rocked her world to the core. She is telling herself and those around her that was an accident. I'll be honest though, it made me wonder as the movie goes on if that could be the case. Looking at the evidence as an outsider, she is rationalizing and it doesn't fit. What I will say here as well is that there's a way to look at this that nothing supernatural is happening. Mia is warped and the things she is doing to help Riley are making it worse. She's finally snapped from stress. That would also mean that Riley had a mental break as well. We don't see enough of his character for that to fit. I don't fall for this camp, but I can see the logical arguments that could be made for this take on the story. Before moving away, I do think that Wilde does a good job in this role and deals with the dark things for her character. It felt believable to me. I also feel horrible for someone her age to have to come to terms with these things.Where I'll then explore the game that they play. This is something that I'll be honest about, I would never join. They look like they're having a great time, but to me it is terrifying. I'd watch people play, but that would be the extent. What works though is that we set up the rules. The candle needs to be blown out or the door is left open. If the spirit is inside your body too long, then it can latch on. What is interesting and going back to my earlier point a bit, Mia has one stay in just too long. We don't know how much longer, but it went over 90 seconds. That is the start of everything that bad happens going forward. We do know from the cold open that playing with this game has worn on that person until they snapped. Riley also was affected during the party at his house. I like that these teens have messed with forces they shouldn't and the consequences are more than just a game. That is a good message that isn't new, but effective.I'm not sure there is more that I want to go into here so over to the acting. I've already said that Wilde was good. I do like Bird, Jensen and Dhanji are good as her friends. I like as the tension mounts her relationships are strained with them. Terakes and Alosio are good as the catalysts to everything that happens. Marcus Johnson is Max who is Mia's dad. I thought he was good to help build that emotional feel along with Rhea (Alexandria Steffensen) as the mother. I should also include Otto, who I've not seen a bad performance from. Mia is our lead so everyone is pushing her to the climax and resolution. I thought they were good to do just that.All that is left then would be filmmaking. The first thing I want to go into with this is cinematography. They do interesting things with camera movement. When people become possessed, it jerks with them as the spirit enters. That was good. There are interesting shots using mirrors and windows, which was also solid. This uses the whole frame and it is effective. I'd also say that there's probably a combination of practical and CGI effects. Those worked. The look of the ghosts is terrifying at times which I liked. Editing helps here to show that reality might not be what we think as Mia descends into madness. Other than that, I like the use of soundtrack and design here as it was also effective building tension.In conclusion, I like what this movie is doing. It isn't reinventing the subgenre. Incorporating the teens of today with making a game of something they don't fully understand works for me. The supernatural elements are good or the fact that this can be looked at where they aren't happening. The acting is good. Wilde's performance works and I like that the rest of the cast pushes her character of Mia to where things end. I also think that this is well-made. The look of the ghosts and the cinematography being the bright spots there. This is a contender for my end of year list. One that I'm excited to revisit as well.My Rating: 8 out of 10.",2023-08-14
I love the film grain they used. The tone of the movie was good. I just feel like this was meant for a pg 13 audience... A few good scares. This movie pacing is not perfect. And it loose it's tension a lot. Now to the spoilers I would have like to see limbo more when they touch the hand they can talk with the dead and its a cool idea but we don't get to see this a lot . It focus on the girl I guess we can say she a little rebel. But her father tried to be there for her and she just pushes him away . It Skip around a little too much at points leaving you confused at moments. It was alright but could have been slightly better at certain points... Still confused after seeing it.,2023-08-03
"This movie deserves all of the praise it's been getting. I recently heard someone say it's the best movie so far of 2023 and I laughed, but when I looked.....I had to agree. The year's not over but this is better than anything that's come out so far. I don't usually go for horror, but this was very well done. Good writing, VERY impressive acting, and a perfect ending. I was confused by the kangaroo scene in the beginning, I wasn't sure what the purpose was, but when I really thought about it that was a brilliant bit of foreshadowing. It's a ""spirit board"" movie, where kids contact spirits and bad things happen, and even though that's been done a million times this felt very fresh. I read somewhere that they're doing a Prequel and I'm all for it, I just hope an increased budget doesn't ruin it.",2023-09-16
"Wow! What fun! How cool was that? Australians have always made incredible films. Just throw this one on the Barbie too. No, seriously, go see this instead. See what I did there?Gallipoli, the Mad Max films, Animal Kingdom, The Square (2008), Chopper and The Horseman all quickly come to mind.This strives for the same excellence and actually does so in horror.It's all things scary movies should be.Above all it's creative, fresh and new.Funny at parts. Yes!! Got to have that humor.It's beautiful in others.It's short. About an hour and a half. That's how you do it! All these bloated two to three hours American films, ugh!It's well shot, frightening and disgusting at times.The cast is amazing and due to breakout from this film for sure.The lead, Sophie Wilde as Mia is captivatingly gorgeous, commands the screen and scotches her every scene.The filmmakers, the Phillippous need to continue on their way in making excellent Australian original content.Please don't be swayed or wooed by big American studios trying to bailout their own sinking and stale franchises.I should have known these directors had a hand, ha, a hand, get it? Wow. But they did, in working on The Babadook.And Miranda Otto, whom I have loved for years now but no more so in one of the greatest films of all time, The Thin Red Line.Love her!Here she plays Sue. The mother of two of the teens and a mother figure to Mia.This is a great horror film. It will become a classic. I can see the hand being merchandised and sold as Halloween house decor already. Yikes.Terrific suspense. Believable action and dialogue.This isn't just the Best Horror Movie of 2023.It's One of the Best Movies in All of 2023.",2023-07-31
It's been a long time since I've seen a movie that made me uncomfortable from a horror perspective. Practical affects and good acting made it very intens and had me on edge during some of the scenes. Very impressed that they created a full circle immersive story with limited budget. Characters are a bit cringy (18 year olds are kinda cringy in real life). But the acting was great and choices believable most of the times. The ending makes you think about the perspective of the film and doesn't feel crowd pleasing or easy.I would definitely give this one a chance if you like well executed practical effects and a fresh view on a classic teen possession film.,2023-10-29
"A24 never disappoints with their psychological, creative, aesthetically-pleasing horror films, and Talk To Me is another masterpiece of theirs. Saw the premiere and the theater was dead silent the entire time, basically, with my friend and I on the edge of our seats.Without revealing much spoilers, this film has a great cast with talented young actors who give some frightening performances. The overall atmosphere is very dark and the concept with the embalmed hand is intriguing, unique, and A24 does a lot of creative, creepy things with it. You'll see. The overall storyline is refreshing, shocking at times, with plenty of innovative scares. Lots of unforgettable, twisted moments!Highly recommend Talk To Me if you're looking for a suspenseful, edgy, psychological, thrilling horror film. 10/10!",2023-07-27
"I had high hopes for this stinker of a film. I saw the preview a while ago and said to myself it looks interesting enough and I should go see it. Well, it stunk. The premise is different and interesting. A concrete hand that you hold onto and say ""talk to me"" and spirits are supposed to present themselves. But also, then you have to say ""I let you in"". I don't know why you have to say both. There really is no difference in what happens between the phrases. The unlikeable cast members do this and are able to see ghosts for a short time. Nothing really comes of it. No questions are asked of them. There's no good dialogue from the other side.The movie had a good start but then it was just pieces of puzzles that had nothing to do with each other. The back story of the main characters mother and her death added nothing. The relationship with her father was pointless as well. Nothing really added up and there were way too many plot holes. It felt like bits and pieces of different stories thrown together that were unrelated. The guy who was stabbed in the beginning shows up again towards the last quarter and he provided nothing to the story. They could've shown ghosts more than what they did but instead, they just followed the main character on a senseless circle that went nowhere.I have NO idea how anyone could rate this higher than a 4 or 5. There really was no middle or end in this disjointed garbage. I can't even really say story because there isn't one. I felt very stupid at the end because it was my choice for my family to see it. It was a waste of money and time. I wouldn't even rent it.",2023-09-17
"Talk To MeA24's latest supernatural horror sees a group of teenagers contacting spirits by touching an embalmed hand, albeit, without exceeding ninety seconds. Everything goes downhill when they forget the rules of the game.Talk To Me starts with a bang and ends with a brilliantly sequenced finale. The plot is fresh and progresses well and even with a slightly muddled last quarter, it doesn't falter.The practical effects are jolting and potent, and deliver dread. The sound effects and score harmoniously bring the horror elements through (with ELGRINDO's Have You Ever already a viral TikTok sound).The cast of Talk To Me is pivotal to its success. Sophie Wilde delivers a compelling lead performance, with newcomer Joe Bird giving heft to the horror sequences.With news of a prequel and sequel already in the works, Talk To Me has brought an exciting franchise to A24.8.5/10.",2023-09-16
"Talk to Me is the feature film directorial debut of popular Australian YouTubers Danny and Michael Philippou, and especially for first-time filmmakers, this is just an excellent horror movie loaded with a sense of dread that you should definitely see. It may not have the most promising title and the same budget that explosive action movies work with, but you'll probably be more towards the edge of your seat than most films can do.The storyline is very simple; a group of teenage friends begin to seek thrills by using an embalmed hand to see and communicate with unusual spirits, until one of these teens lets a spirit in for too long. The spirit doesn't want to leave his body, and it possesses him into committing horrific acts, such as extreme self-mutilation. It's violent, disturbing and there's lots of blood to see, so it's obviously not one to bring the kids along to see.It feels so rare nowadays that moviegoers and horror fans get to see a strong cinema flick that actually frightens them, and you'd never expect that kind of horror movie to come from a pair of Aussie YouTube brothers with a budget of less than $5 million. Well, this film is extremely creepy and utterly terrifying, not necessarily relying on cheap jump-scares and violence to scare you. The sense of dread picks up from the first time we see them communicating with the dead, and a twisted final scene leaves you with thoughts, wonders and goosebumps.Settling in with the characters, whose cast members each deliver incredible and convincing performances, might start off feeling like a bit of a rush if you're expecting a steady intro. But thanks to the direction, cinematography, sub-plot themes of grief and mental health, as well as some really scary imagery, you'll want to stay for the rest. The effects and depictions of violence also feel very real, which only increases how disturbing it is. At a perfect runtime of 90 minutes, it's paced perfectly, refusing to waste any time. So try to go and see Talk to me. It's definitely a horror film worth paying to go to the cinema for. Good low-budget movies like this high-class creation truly deserve our support.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",2023-08-05
"It's not everyday I hear about Horror films that were made in Australia, made by Australians and with an Australian cast. I did hear about this film a couple times. It's funny, because when I first saw the trailer one day in the previews I was like ""Oh cool. Looks not bad."" Then after hearing and seeing all these incredible reviews of this movie, I couldn't help but to go see it and well, I can say now that Talk To Me is easily the best Horror film of 2023 and the best Horror film since Smile from 2022. Talk To Me executes the Horror that we all need back in the Horror genre. Not jump scares! Horror as in a deep, engaging, horrifying story and realism that pushes its limits so far that you can't help but be completely jaw dropped and uncomfortable. Which was exactly how I felt throughout most of this movie. In simple words, the movie teaches you to just never, ever play with dark mediums of any sort. Whether people think that stuff is real or not, it's extremely dangerous. But to go into more depth of this movie, I liked everything about it. Sophia Wilde, a phenomenal actress that owns this movie and including the other cast that did a good job as well. The unsettling soundtrack that seemingly crawls up your spine. The cinematography is on another level. The incredible writing. The horrific imagery is pretty eerie. The scenes that leave you feeling so many different emotions. This movie reminded me of Get Out, Hereditary and Smile. Except Talk To Me goes even more beyond the limits of Horror than these three that I mentioned. And not that they are bad movies, they are great too. But Talk To Me, is a perfect example of a rare Horror gem. There won't be anything quite like this for awhile. Congratulations to Australia for showing us what REAL HORROR IS....",2023-08-01
"Talk To Me is an independent Australian film with an interesting premise that replaces the Ouija board with a hand that looks like an old artifact. The funny thing is that it was directed by 2 youtubers and it is a well-executed independent film, which is quite an achievement for this pair of directors as this is their first film debut. Of course, the concept of teenagers messing with something supernatural without considering the consequences may already be somewhat cliché, but it is enjoyable and shocking at times. It has a simple, but accomplished story. Of course, the matter of Mia's parents could have been delved into more, since there was still more to offer. The horror setting is well executed and doesn't bother to offer jump scares. Simply, it offers a story with a dark and terrifying atmosphere that appeals to the psychology of the protagonist. The story focuses a lot on the rupture suffered by the group of friends after playing with forces beyond their comprehension. The makeup and special effects were also praised well. So you could say that Talk To Me is a fairly conventional independent horror film that isn't very innovative, but it is a film that fulfills its purpose and is recommended as a curiosity to those who are horror fans. My final rating for this movie is 9/10.",2023-08-24
"This is an okay movie. Nothing more, nothing less. The acting is cheesy and the feel is very gen z. Is this movie worth all the stars? No. There are numerous movies which are far better, and a few are far worse. I made the mistake of renting it and now I feel I wasted the 6 bucks. It was definitely not worth all the extra hype. The acting is a bit subpar and it definitely feels like a weird Australian movie. If you live in Australia maybe this is what you are searching for, but in the rest of the world, it doesn't live up to the expectations set for it. Now I'm ranting cuz I'm forced to type so much.",2023-10-10
"The beginning in the party house, where a weird and insane murder happened, was really involving.So I was expecting something unusual in this genre, but...The offputting teenager characters (I felt sick watching them doing some silly modern stuff like being glued to cellphones, smoking weed, having boring arguments with the seniors) were a first warning sign.Ok - here comes the story plot: a ceramic hand, an original idea with a handshake to contact the dead... Of course, things MUST go wrong here :-) And to tell the truth, I was ready for that. I knew it would probably not happen right away.However, the way it went afterwards was pretty much predictable for me and... disappointing. Actually, it was a mess of actions caused by the thoughts of the obsessed protagonist.I cannot give a high score to the production design - for instance, the makeup for the evil spirits. Especially after watching another horror movie several days ago where it was really top-notch! Here it was rather funny (the look of the dead mom and others).The cinematography is pretty good, I think. But it is not enough to give this movie a high mark.",2023-09-15
"If you can lower your expectations, Talk to Me is an incredibly well done low budget scary movie.There are some scenes that are genuinely upsetting and will stick in your mind.However, the praise that it has received has been too much. But this isn't the fault of the movie makers.Overall it is a well made movie.The acting is, for the most part, good but the father is pretty wooden.The sound design really adds to the uncomfortable feel of particular scenes.The effects and make up are suitably creepy.However, there are some disappointments. The ending isn't as strong as the rest of the movie.So I think Talk to Me is overrated, but still worth watching.",2023-09-14
"Not usually into horror, but this one really impressed me! The story was solid from start to finish, and the ending left me thoroughly satisfied.Following a group of teens using a chilling ritual to summon spirits, the film delivered intense moments with gruesome displays. It wasn't scary for me personally, but the horror elements were well-balanced, allowing the actors to shine.The movie skillfully built up the story and had unexpected character twists. ""Talk to Me"" explores the eerie world of conjuring spirits, bridging the living and the dead. A terrific display of possession on both sides!If you're a horror fan, this one's a must-watch! I'm giving ""Talk to Me"" a solid four out of five stars!",2023-07-29
"Too many horror movies tend to do this these days; relying mostly on shock content and the grossest violence they can think of. And this film doesn't even do a great job of that. While some great horror films have been able to pull this off, like Event Horizon or The Fly, this film isn't one of them. Disturbing violence has to be backed up with substance in a film. You have to care about the characters and why it's happening to them. Talk to Me doesn't bother with much of that. We're just supposed to be assaulted by loud jump scares and sudden graphic self-made injuries on screen and be disturbed and upset. Very poor, lazy writing.I was disappointed with A24 here. And Australia. Hereditary and The Babadook are two of my favorite horror films of all time. So when I saw the ad for this I thought that sure the plot seems silly, its an adams family thing hand that some kids got ahold of that lets them contact spirits, but I was sure the writers had created a good complex plot with psychological horror happening to good, well written characters. They didn't. And when I learned shortly before viewing it was co-written by RuckaRucka, the guys who make youtube videos of Ronald McDonald pointlessly killing people in the most gruesome ways possible, I guess I should've known better.To each his own when it comes to what scares you in a horror movie, but I hold A24 to a much higher standard than this.",2023-08-13
"Talk to Me tells the story of a group of teenagers namely, Mia(Sophie Wilde), Jade(Alexandra Jensen), Riley(Joe Bird), Hayley(Zoe Terakes), Joss(Chris Alosio) & Daniel(Otis Dhanji). Mia, Jade & the rest of the gang find a never-seen-before method to summon the dead, using a cursed embalmed hand. However, things go awry when someone pushes the boundaries of what they should do with the malevolent hand.Talk to Me is a jaw-dropping film. Directors Danny Phillippou & Michael Phillippou have given us a movie that is terrifying right from the word go, & not because of the cliched horror tropes. This film is a psychological horror movie, with absolutely no jump scares. It's cerebral & subversive in the best way possible. However, if you hate extreme gore or horror movies in general then, you shouldn't watch this one. Right from the word go, you will be on the edge of your seat throughout & the film absolutely doesn't let up, until the credits roll. The use of only practical effects instead of the same old boring CGI, takes up the scare quotient to an extreme level. Sophie Wilde is awe-inspiring as Mia. Wilde shines in her first lead role & has a long & bright future ahead of her, in Hollywood. Alexandra Jensen is spectacular as Jade. Joe Bird is mind-blowing as Riley. Miranda Otto is spectacular as Sue. Zoe Terakes is awesome as Hayley. Chris Alosio is good as Joss. Otis Dhanji is fantastic as Daniel. The supporting cast is excellent. Talk to Me is a must watch for horror movie buffs. Watch it on the big screen & prepare to be spooked out of your mind!",2023-08-09
"This movie literally sent tingles through my spine, it's the scariest horror I've seen in a long time. It's a debut movie from young Australian filmmakers and they've hit the mark. They've left it open to a possible sequel too. I can see it getting a following. The characters are so real and the quick easy connection to them makes their suffering so close to home. Plenty of suspense and jumpy scenes. It keeps you on the edge of the seat throughout. The story is fast and terrifying. An original plot with believable dialogue.

"There always seems to be one horror movie that gets a surprising amount of hype and positive word of mouth every year, and I guess 2023's the year of Talk To Me, even if it was first screened in 2022. 2022 felt like it was the year of Barbarian. 2020 and 2021 I don't remember - I think everyone was too busy being scared by COVID. 2019 might've been Midsommar, but perhaps more so because in 2018 it was Hereditary, and both were directed by Ari Aster. 2015 was The VVitch, 2014 possibly The Babadook, and so on...Maybe it's not an exact pattern, but at the same time, maybe it's the nature of horror as a genre, and the emotional reactions it inspires, that make at least one big release of every year just take off and steal the thunder of other comparable movies, thanks to generating serious buzz. Traumatising critics and viewers alike (in a good way) also likely helps. And Talk To Me is definitely one of the more upsetting horror movies in recent years, and one that successfully gets under your skin. Horror movies unpacking intense themes regarding death, grief, and other not-very-fun things while also being traditionally scary continually proves to be a winning combination.Characters here are already grappling with various tragedies before the dead start communicating with them a little too much, and things progressively spiral out of control. Talk To Me succeeds in pulling you in quickly. It's paced fast, too, and this does result in some mild implausibilities and a few things that feel a tiny bit lacking from a writing perspective (a character has no restraints or proper security in a hospital, despite them doing incredibly dangerous things to themselves while being hospitalized, and a key character is weirdly absent from the whole climax - things like that which I barely noticed because everything thunders along very fast, but thought about more once the film was over).Shortcuts are taken, which stops it from being a perfect horror movie, but it does ensure it's a continually engaging horror movie where I never felt bored for a second. The performances are very good, the editing and visuals are both very strong, and complaints about small aspects of the writing aside, the core concept is creative and much of the dialogue is well-written. I do understand the hype around this one. I found it both unsettling and very entertaining (in a dark, sort of mortifying way).",2023-08-24
"After going to a wonderful book festival where Leigh Russell kindly signed a book for me, I decided to travel to a cinema for National Cinema Day. Having seen the fun The Invitation (2022-also reviewed) last National Cinema Day, it felt fitting to see another Horror for this years edition, which led to me getting ready to talk that talk to me.View on the film:Handing the curse to the group with superb, claustrophobic steadicam shots that close the walls in, co-writers (with Daley Pearson) / co-directors Danny and Michael Philippou make their feature film debut by closely working with cinematographer Aaron McLisky to place the audience in a vice-like grip chilling atmosphere of SnorriCam shots getting up close to the addiction of the hand, which points to close-ups displaying the detailed, gory prosthetic effects,that are paired with eerie, distorted lingering wide-shots over what is haunting Mia.Joining the Philippou's in making her feature film debut, Sophie Wilde gives a tremendous performance as Mia, whose mourning for the death of her mum is cast by Wilde across Mia's down-cast face. Finding new opportunities at hand, Wilde cleverly uses the pain from the grief Mia experienced, as the driving fear factor for Mia, who attempts to remove it from her life, at all costs.Sitting round recording and laughing at the impact that holding the hand has on people, the screenplay by the Philippou's & Pearson intelligently make the chilling effects of addiction be an underlying subtext, via each high that Mia and her friends get from the hand, leading to them each having to hold it longer and longer for a new hit, until it spirals out to leaving their friendship dead on the floor.Exploring the trouble Mia and her dad, (played with nicely understated compassion by Marcus Johnson) have in talking about their grief with each other, the writers take the curse object Horror sub-genre, and twisting into representing Mia's trying to keep her grief private, until she starts to believe she can finally express herself, with a helping hand.Wisely walking a line of ambiguity over if what Mia and her friends see is the true image of the spirits, (with the writers keeping the spirits as mysterious, frightening figures, rather then give them, long complex backgrounds) the writers draw broad outlines for Mia's pals getting wrapped in a thrilling, deadly chain reaction, as they try to find a way to stop the talk.",2023-10-13
"Talk to Me (2022) masterfully embodies the notion of ""balance"". Its narrative unfolds in a sober manner, avoiding excessive jumpscares and gore scenes, but when these elements are introduced, they do so effectively. The cast, in general, offers convincing performances, with notable emphasis on Sophie Wilde, the film's protagonist.Although the plot is not particularly innovative, following the premise of supernatural apparitions and events linked to spirits, Talk to Me differentiates itself by presenting exceptional organization and direction. The narrative maintains an engaging pace, never leaving room for boring moments throughout its acts.This film stands out as one of the most pleasant surprises of 2022/2023, as it manages to create an engaging atmosphere using resources typical of the horror genre, without resorting to excess information or artifices to which the public is commonly accustomed.",2023-10-09
"If this is meant to be horror movie for Zoomers, then I am really sorry for them.Poor story, poor actors, no humor, no horror.Family tragedy that is centered around the main character was not developed, while horror part of the movie was not scared at all. The whole story could have been developed in a much more twisted way which I expected to start till the very end. But the ending was nothing but disappointment: it was too obvious and mean. Parallel lines of the story are kept unanswered.Looks like the guys had a great idea but the result is nothing but a joke for Zoomers that were laughing and drinking beer behind me.Not a horror, but a bad joke.",2023-08-24
"As the title says i think this movie could have been way better.Absolutely loved the beginning. Its an instant shocker and you want to know what the hell is going on.After that scene we get 25 min of nothing and then the actual movie starts. All the hand scenes are pretty tense and i liked them because it was decently shocking and well acted.They basically had the blueprint for a good movie but then it just started to spiral downwards really fast.What triggered me the most is how absolutely braindead these kids are. No one and i mean NO ONE on this planet is as dumb as these kids. The little brother is slamming his head on the table multiple times but no one does anything even tho literally everyone in the room is stronger than him. Instead they just watch him. We can see the same later in the hospital when his sister watches him banging his head on the wall.Also we never get any real explanation on the history of the hand, how they knew the sentences they have to say and why no one, not even police care about multiple videos of kids completely tripping on the hand drug. They dont even bother confiscating the evidence and just let them keep the hand.Filming and acting wise it was good tho.",2023-09-21
"Regal cinema does mystery movie showings and this is what I ended up seeing. Definitely caught me off guard, I personally watch a ridiculous amount of horror movies and find myself not getting too scared anymore but this movie made me blatantly uncomfortable in a lot of different scenes, I mean this movie was better than the new Insidious movie :'). The theater was packed to the brim and this was the type of movie that had the entire crowd letting out gasps and sounds of discomfort. Very graphic movie, it makes you uncomfortable in a perfect horror movie way. I'd give it 10/10 but some of the characters were typical dumb horror movie characters that made poor decisions. I think this movie is definitely best watched knowing nothing about it and just jumping in, try to avoid spoilers!",2023-07-20
"In many ways, ""Talk to Me"" can be compared with Ari Aster's ""Hereditary"". Both movies, beside being excellent debuts for their directors, are actually more a drama than an horror. The horrific elements are there, but more to strengthen the underlying psychological suffering that some characters are undergoing.The plot is simple: a group of high-school friends comes into possession of a ""cursed"" ceramic hand. If you grip it you see the spirit of a dead person, to whom you can talk. If you want to go further, this spirit possesses you until someone breaks the grip between you and the hand. This becomes a fun party activity, with people enjoying the thrill to ""be possessed"" - and of course things go south fast.A case can be made for these horrific elements to actually be only hallucinatory. I think that there are enough hints in the movie that point for most of them to be real; however, about some of the ""supernatural"" events that follow some of the characters we just don't know - as the experience with the ""hand"" can cause serious problems to minds already the verge of a breakdown. Deciding if some horrific moments are real or just hallucinations id part of the fun of the movie.In the hands of lesser directors this could have become an also-ran movie in the ""Ouija board"" genre. Instead, it is the story of some people living through difficult periods of their lives, with recent dramatic events still lacking closure. The ""hand"" does seem to feed on this suffering until the situation goes out of control. In this, the plot reminds a lot of a Stephen King story. Be prepared for 90% drama and 10% of (genuine) horror.I liked how we are thrown into the story ""in media res"". We don't know these people, their relationships, how they got the hand and what torments them from their past. It is like meeting a group of friends for the first time, and it is upon us to piece together who they are and what's happening.The acting is strong all around and a big kudos goe to the young actors, The only disappointment is Miranda Otto, as her acting talents are wasted in the only banal character in the movie (it is always nice to see her, toh).At the end, the only weak point of this really strong debut is the plot: it is very conventional. Any horror aficionado will easily see how thing are going to develop and predict the end. The ending, to be clear, works, but I saw it coming halfway through the movie.All in all, a surprisingly good movie. I can't wait for the director's next effort - hoping that this time they will choose a stronger story to tell.",2023-10-22
"Refreshingly good. It does use some standard tropes but overall it's filled with interesting and original takes on the genre. It has some jump scares but doesn't overdo them. Uses psychology and emotions well and serves as possibly an interesting metaphor for dealing with grief and loss.Synopsis:
Talk to Me is a 2022 Australian supernatural horror film directed by Danny and Michael Philippou and written by Danny Philippou and Bill Hinzman, based on a concept by Daley Pearson. It stars Sophie Wilde, Alexandra Jensen, Joe Bird, Otis Dhanji, Miranda Otto, Zoe Terakes, Chris Alosio, Marcus Johnson, and Alexandria Steffensen. The film follows a group of teenagers who discover they are able to contact spirits using a mysterious embalmed hand, only for one of them to take things too far.",2023-08-27
Never have I seen any more by The Numbers movie that totally has only the good bits from the trailer used to add nauseam I went to see this at a secret screening and honestly all I can say it is absolutely useless as a horror movie we've still did dialogue overplayed token characters and a clock that can be seen miles away the only good part of the movie is that designs of the Ghosts themselves but if you've ever seen a cliche movie about ghost tricking a innocent human being into doing what they want then you've seen this movie it's not worth seeing I would rate it poor at best do not go and see this as you'll be highly disappointed and just laughing most of the time.,2023-07-24
"I went into Talk to Me with very high expectations, and honestly...the film exceeded them. This is one of the best horror films of 2023 and probably the best A24 horror film I've seen since...Midsommar. Yeah, it's that good.Talk to Me is an example of how to take a relatively straightforward premise and do something fresh and exciting with it. Unlike say, The Boogeyman, this movie doesn't feel like it's treading in place, hitting the exact same beats as other movies, even if we may have seen some of it before.Part of this has to do with the energy the film captures; it's hard to explain, but there's a distinct ""teenage energy"" that Talk to Me nails, and something I always like when I see it on screen. It's entirely believable to me that these people we're seeing are teenagers and they'd act the way they do (mistakes and all). There's a zippy, fun, fast-paced nature to the movie that I adore and the complete opposite of the slow, boring horror that most associate with the ""elevated"" subgenre.A lot of this wouldn't be possible without the cast. Sophie Wilde, who plays our scream queen Mia (an iconic horror heroine name), is INCREDIBLE. Her eyes alone are probably enough reason for her casting (when they black out, it's a legitimately terrifying visual), but luckily, she excels in displaying every emotion and delivering a complex performance for a complex character. Mia is likeable, she's funny, sweet, vulnerable...but there's a darkness to her that's undeniable and Wilde captures it PERFECTLY. Women really do excel in horror films, honestly.The entire cast is great, but I have to shout out Zoe Terakes and Chris Alsio, who were electric any time they were on screen. I love it when movies have great side characters and these two were so fun to watch, I honestly wish they were in the film longer. The only performance I didn't completely love was Miranda Otto, who I think overstayed her welcome at points. There's also Joe Bird, who...well, let's just say gives an extremely...physical performance.Getting this out of the way, what happens to his character is absolutely horrific. I can't stress enough how disturbing this movie can be at times and how unbelievably effective it is in the horror department. Right now, ghoulish imagery from this movie flashes in my head as I'm writing this. The make up and effects are top tier, with a wet, gross look to the creatures and oodles of extremely effective gore. I can't go on enough about the make up is; even the blacked out eyes look way scarier than I imagined they would and reminded me of...The Sadness (yes, that one - the Taiwanese movie) of all movies.In fact, there are A LOT of aspects of The Sadness that appear in this film as well, to its benefit. The film also wears the inspiration of Evil Dead (my favourite horror franchise) on its sleeve; those two franchises are not bad inspirations. Like in those films, the dead aren't just shuffling, quiet corpses...but devious, clever, evil, and perverted. Yes. (If you've seen The Sadness, you'll understand.Part of this has to do with the excellent cinematography and sound mixing, which feels violent and jarring at times. Every time the camera spins and follows a character, it feels like they're being whipped around and the sound that accompanies everything just elevates the tension. This is not a jump scare movie; it's a movie that keeps you unsettled from the jump.If I had any issues with Talk to Me, it's that I wish it was longer. I wouldn't have minded a scene or two elaborating on The Hand and where it came from or just characters hanging out, honestly. Given how good everyone is, fleshing the character's world and contexts would've been welcome.But as it stands, this is just a well put together, tight film that I'd watch again and show to as many people as possible. It's that good. And yes, even after seeing the movie, I would most definitely hold the hand, light the candle, and say ""talk to me."" (Oh and minor point, I loved how Australian this movie was).",2023-08-02
"'Talk to me' is a teeny horror movie from Australia led by young actors. The main plot deals with a group of teenagers that get hold off a mysterious hand, which, when touched, let's you speak with someone from the other side. The story is pretty straightforward. I was quite surprised by two brutal scenes that I didn't see coming, probably the answer to the age limit. The last 45 minutes are action packed, which wasn't necessary. I think the movie has definitely potential, but it gave away some great opportunities. The youngest kid is definitely the show off of the whole movie. The main plot is expandable. I didn't find the movie very scary and the two scenes I mentioned are rather unexpected and therefore hit your nerve cause it's very graphic. You will be entertained, but don't expect much from the storyline. It's very simple with a predictable ending.",2023-08-06
Crosses the line for the sake of shock value and unfortunately to the detriment of the narrative and intelligence of it's character's. Not a single character is relatable; everyone of them is spiteful and stupid. It's some drastic skewed vision of what Aussie teenagers are like (Aussies do actually have empathy like every other human being believe it or not). The biggest failure is not communicating why these teens love getting possessed. It's very hard to continue along with a POV that's unfeasible. The fact that all the characters brush past the horror elements devalues the horror. This movie is just a bunch of random gut wrenching scenarios stitched together with crude comedy and illogical characters. Would've worked better as a youtube video.,2023-10-12
"I rented this on Amazon Prime, struggled to make out much of the dialogue, lots of mumbling. To be honest, meh. This reminded me of Hereditary, so much hype and a solid IMDB score but not my type of horror. It was a drama / thriller for me. That being said, has done exceptionally well at the Box Office therefore the audience is there. Lack of tension, lack of jump scares, some very questionable acting. One of my favourite horror films is Sinister, its follow up, The Black Phone, was meh. I guess my horror tastes are changing as I get older. I agree with other reviews that the film could have benefited from another 20 minutes to explain some of the narrative.",2023-10-07
"First off, I was seeing tons of hype for this movie and so going in I was expecting a lot. One thing I will start by saying is I wish the movie had subtitles. I had a hard time hearing a lot of the dialogue with the cast having heavy Australian accents. With A24 movies you either get an extremely weird movie that you don't know if you hate it or love it or you get a holy grail film (hereditary). Talk to Me was right in the middle where it was an all-around GOOD movie. It was no holy grail but it was way better than all the garbage that I've been seeing this year (excluding evil dead and barbarian). The cast was amazing the acting was amazing from people I've never heard of or seen before this and I was astonished at how well the acting was by every actor/actress in this movie. The Music was really good as well. There was no element to what was going to happen next it was so non-predictable that it kept you gripping the seat most of the movie. There were some very offputting gory unsettling scenes with outstanding makeup. You could tell they put a lot of effort into this movie and it paid off. I will say it's not the scariest movie I've seen, but rather more of anticipation horror. My consensus is that if you want a good horror movie, go see Talk to me.",2023-08-04
"Despite the title of this review, the movie was very good. The only thing was that this was labelled a horror movie with several reviews raving that it was abrasively intense throughout. I was not scared or dreading the atmosphere at all aside from some jumps but that is to be expected. I was just really invested in the story and found it extremely creepy. On the plus side though, the movie works perfectly. A very unique idea that was well crafted and conveyed on the screen. The possession scenes were exceptional with cool details and execution. Those scenes were intense with great acting by the whole cast. I enjoyed the dark elements and thoroughly felt that each aspect of the story unfolded seamlessly with good character arcs and a solid ending. As with all A24 films it feels very indie with all the rawness one could handle but with a solid budget and it shows. Aside from Miranda Otto all the actors are essentially unknowns but brought their ""A"" game and showed off like veterans. Some other creepy elements and a very damaged lead were ideal for the story's progression and it didn't feel campy or cheesy in any way. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for something different.",2023-09-16
"Talk To MeThis was a very good horror movie that was clearly made for the team Australian market as it contained so much brutal slang that I needed to have the subtitles to make any sense of it.Upon a simple premise, of a mummified hand of a psychic, the teenagers played pranks with it, and of course, it all went terribly wrong.There was plenty of gore, And some really very good horror acting, the lead Mia, played by Sophie Wilde, did a great job, even though the role did not require a full range of acting skill.I enjoyed it very much and it a 7 outta 10 from me, meaning if you like horror this is well worth watching.",2023-09-25
"I did not much about the movie other than what I got from the trailer, like a hand that takes over people with spirits and thinking it would just be a standard possession movie; after watching the movie, I found out that it more than a simple possession movie and it had more to it than I thought. The movie Talk to Me (2023) was a chilling, disturbing, interesting, and creepy horror movie that might be my favorite horror movie of the year 2023 compared to the other horror movies I have seen this year.Actor Sophie Wilde did a fantastic job playing the main character Mia; you feel bad for her when she is dealing with the loss of her mother from something awful and when she is dealing with the many horrific stuff after interacting with the embalmed hand to conjure spirits. The group teenagers Mia was a part of dealing with the hand was interesting on how they would use it a lot when you do not want them to touch it anymore, especially when stuff goes down as the movie progresses and it starts affecting them in disturbing ways. Also, whenever they decide to group together to use the embalmed hand to conjure spirits like it is a game, it makes you wonder how the hand works and how it can connect the living to the dead whenever they use it.The embalmed hand is simple looking, but it does have some kind of disturbing look to it so you can fear it whenever it comes on screen; I mostly liked how it worked and how they used it to talk to the spirits or get taken over by them and to end the connection by following certain rules. The movie starts like a normal possession movie, but as the movie progresses it becomes unique and violent in many ways involving the possessions or from misunderstandings from certain things that happen. Also, the designs of the spirits that appear are creepy, disturbing along with cool uses of cinematography to make moments creepy.The third act climax was interesting and disturbing on how it played out, and the ending was chilling and surprising to watch. Talk to Me (2023) is a horror movie I highly recommend watching for how unique, creepy, disturbing, and interesting the movie is with how the embalmed hand is used to conjure up spirits, but also how the teenagers using the hand can get addicted to something that is not good for them. One of my favorite horror movies is to come out in the year 2023; give it watch when you can because I would like this movie to be talked about and shown to more people so we can more original horror movies like this.",2023-09-23
"A teen grieving for her mother volunteers for a spooky prank among her friends, but finds herself drawn in deeper than anyone expected.Not totally satisfying, but an impressive Australian entry in the high-school dice-with-death genre. The first half is excellent, opening with a busy shocker of a prequel scene, before launching us into a world of adolescent rebellion and angst, where the energetic characters always react with frank humour or touches of sensitivity.The performances are strong, helped by a script that balances action and dialogue just right, and the editing and direction keep the story unfolding at a good pace, with a couple of reversed plot-points to open up new areas of intrigue. The sound design has clever moments, and the lack of jump scares means it never has to go over the top. Plus the music is full of energy, including that Sia song everyone drunkenly sings along to without realizing its subject is the despair of addiction. Nice.The second half narrows its focus and, while the tension does build, we lose touch with some of the complex characterization of the group in favour of a personal journey into madness. The balance between the psychological and the supernatural isn't quite right for me, I guess because the necessary weirdness and mystery is sacrificed for the sake of bringing on the climax and resolution. Compared to another recent Australian horror, the brilliant Run, Rabbit Run, it just lacks the sophistication to leave me open-mouthed in horror. But I ain't really complaining - it's still one of the best in the past couple of years.Overall: Top of its sub-genre.",2023-09-21
"I personally like watching horror movies and I must say I enjoyed watching this one even though it's not scary at all. The story has the right premises but I personally didn't like how the story develops, especially the ending. I find the actors pretty good and their depiction of a group of teenagers works pretty well. All that said the movie is unfortunately not scary at all, it has its jumps scares which are done pretty well but the story just isn't scary. The ""detective"" horror genre it's now a trend and this one perfectly suits the type, with a curse that needs to be solved. A perfect example of this type of horror movie is ""Smile"".All that said I wouldn't hype too much for this movie but if you are looking for an easy horror movie to watch this one could be the one for you.",2023-10-12
"Coming from one who steers clear of horror films that deal with the supernatural, Talk To Me is a resounding recommend, an ode to the craft of first time filmmakers Danny & Michael Philippou. Here, the brothers known for live action Youtube horrors, step up their offerings by elevating the ever popular ouija board concept, with fresh, exciting tropes & terrific storytelling. And the result, is as breathtaking, as it is terrifying.While Talk To Me accounts for the familiar premise that sees the usual thrill-seeking teenagers, needlessly making contact with enraged supernaturals, it is Mia's storyline that takes the trope notches more significant. Her grief and trauma as emotional backdrops is genius, as it gives a personal & moving reason for the horrifying madness let loose in its wake. As predatory forces prey on Mia's silent suffering as invitations, our worst fears are then effectively resembled. Apart from Mia's perspective, Talk To Me nails its scare tactics through expertly crafted sound design, that accounts for its atmosphere of dread & out of the shadows peril. The effectiveness is furthered by outstanding camerawork that spooks without the need for annoying jump scares.Overall, Talk To Me paves its own way for appreciation from both hardcore & fair weather fans of the genre. It is genuinely tense, scary, and boasts of a fresh & exciting adaptation that adds meaning to its well executed tropes. I confirm then, Talk To Me is the first film of its kind that I actually admire.",2023-10-09
"As a lover of most all things A24, I waited and waited to see this movie. And what a disappointment it was. This is more of a comedy than a horror. Myself and most everyone else in the theater were laughing at how incredibly dumb and silly most of the ""scary"" scenes were.I have no idea how this is scoring a 7.5/10 when it's nowhere even close to being as great as Midsommar, Hereditary, Men, The Witch, Saint Maud, etc. It makes me wonder if the scariest movies most of the reviewers have seen are Dirty Dancing, The Princess Bride, and Four Weddings and a Funeral... but then again those are all actually far more terrifying than Talk to Me.",2023-08-15
"I feel quite generous giving this movie 3/10. I was expecting so much more from the reviews I'd read and seeing the trailer.Within the first few minutes of watching, I realised that it's more of a horror aimed at teens. I found it quite annoying and immature where they were using a hand to speak to spirits at a party!I had such high hopes but was let down! The idea was definitely there but it just bored me. There were no jump scares in my opinion and as the film went on, it became quite predictable what was going to happen and how it was going to play outThis film could have been made so much better but sadlyI feel it was a huge let down.",2023-09-16
"While there is lot of misconceptions about the flick,I feel it as a pure horror or the best thats A24 had produced till date...
Easily surpasses all expectations with carefully well crafted and superbly paced and all the cast out numbered our guess with their breathtaking performance...!!!Superbly debuted by youtubers Danny & Michael phillippou the way their transition to directors are inventive & sincere take on this genre is an absolute master class keeping u refreshingly spine chilling and shockingly terrific...
While most of may get perplexed with the climax and thats where the directors touch lines keeping their plot live for the sequel.Overall not to be missed.",2023-09-14
"Possession horror is one of the most popular subgenres with countless good and bad films. As a fan of anything supernatural this is certainly one of my favorite categories but to find an actual creative film that looks good, has an interesting story and a decent amount of fear factor is a true rarity. This directorial debut from the Philippou brothers has managed to do just that! The film instantly creates a sense of mystery and pins your attention until the very end through a highly interesting plot that has an idea to get your head working and your heart pumping as you are enjoying the experience.Talk To Me is about a group of friends who begin summoning spirits using an embalmed hand. Each possession is uploaded to social media and before long, teenagers all around become anxious to try it themselves because of the feeling of ecstasy that comes with the experience. Eventually, one of the sessions goes wrong and no one understands how to fix it because nobody actually knew the nature of this mysterious hand.What stands out about Talk To Me is that there is no exposition or any digestion throughout the film as it lets the audience come up with their own ideas. Instead it uses the intrigue to grab your hand and pull you into the mystery through the effective use of suspense and solid cinematography. The limited scares are well made and the hospital vision in particular has got to be one of my favorite and most terrifying scenes in years. Genuine stuff of nightmares.The idea of social media and how kids will do anything for the trend as well as the concept of constantly chasing the high and how it can doom you are well captured. However, the movie never tries to teach you like bloody elevated horror and instead prioritizes the actual escapism horror experience. The movie is never stale and constantly hands you something interesting to keep the heart pumping and the brain ticking. I do recommend seeing it in the cinema as it's an atmospheric and creative Indie horror that remains fascinating over the course of its short time.P. S. The real horror of this movie is how everyone kept putting shoes on beds and furniture.Movieswithoutshmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV reviews.",2023-08-07

"Apart from Picnic at Hanging Rock (sort of), Wolf Creek, and The Babadook, I haven't seen many Australian scary movies, I heard quite a bit and saw the trailer for this one a few times, so I was looking forward to it. Basically, at a crowded house party, Cole (Ari McCarthy) is searching for his brother Duckett (Sunny Johnson). When Cole finds Duckett and tries to take him home, Duckett stabs his brother before committing suicide by stabbing himself in the face. Meanwhile, seventeen-year-old Mia (Sophie Wilde) is struggling due to it being the second anniversary of the death of her mother Rhea (Alexandria Steffensen) who overdosed, and she has a distant relationship with her father Max (Marcus Johnson). Driving at night, she comes across a fatally injured kangaroo, but cannot bring herself to put it out of its misery. Mia, her best friend Jade (Alexandra Jensen), and Jade's little brother Riley (Joe Bird) sneak out to one of many gatherings hosted by Hayley (Zoe Terakes) and Joss (Chris Alosio). The main attraction of the evening is a severed, embalmed hand of mysterious origin. Holding the hand and saying ""Talk to me"" allows a person to see a spirit, followed by saying ""I let you in"", enabling the spirit to possess them. The connection must be severed before ninety seconds to prevent the spirits from binding themselves to that person. Mia volunteers to go first and is possessed by a spirit that displays a menacing focus on Riley. Joss and Hayley manage to break the connection, but only after the time limit is exceeded slightly. Mia says the feeling the hand brought her, along with Hayley, Joss, and Jade's boyfriend Daniel (Otis Dhanji) was amazing. The friends all gather at Jade's house the next night. Jade refuses to allow Riley to participate, but all the others indulge, enjoying the euphoria of possession. When Jade leaves the room, Mia agrees to let Riley take a turn. But Mia is shocked when Riley appears to be possessed by the spirit of her mother, who attempts to reconcile with her daughter. Mia stops the group from ending the possession to keep talking to Rhea, completely disregarding the time limit. Riley's body is overtaken by the spirits, who make him repeatedly smash his face against the table in a suicide attempt. He is taken to hospital in critical condition. Jade and her mother Sue (Miranda Otto) both blame Mia for Riley's injuries. Mia is haunted by visions of Rhea and has secretly taken the embalmed hand. She repeatedly tries to contact her mother using the hand, wanting to confirm her death was accidental and wanting to help Riley. In the hospital, Riley is still possessed, and attempts self-harming every time he wakes up. Mia, Jade, Daniel, Hayley and Joss track down Cole, who reveals where the hand came from, and it is revealed that the spirits can imitate people. Cole says that the spirits' hold on Riley will eventually weaken on its own. Fearing that Riley may not have time, Mia tries to contact him in the hospital by using the hand but is instead shown a vision of Riley being tortured in limbo. At home, Max reads Rhea's suicide note to Mia, apologising for hiding the truth from her. Soon after, Rhea's spirit tells Mia that Max is lying. Mia hallucinates that she is being violently attacked by Max, then the real Max hears the commotion, breaks down her door to check on her, and Mia inadvertently stabs him in the neck with a pair of scissors. Mia was told by Rhea that Riley needs to die to be set free from his possession and hallucinated the injured kangaroo from earlier. Intending to put him out of his misery, Mia kidnaps Riley from the hospital in a wheelchair. Jade sees her pushing Riley toward the edge of the highway. Rhea tries to convince Mia to push Riley into oncoming traffic, but when she says ""We'll have him forever"", Mia realises that ""Rhea"" is the malevolent spirit from her initial possession manipulating her all along. Mia steps back as Jade rushes to save her brother, and Mia is hit by a car and lies badly injured on the road. Mia suddenly finds herself in the hospital. She gets up and walks past Riley who is fully recovered and with his family and sees her recovered father leaving as well. But no-one can hear her speaking, and she notices her hands are disfigured. After becoming engulfed in darkness, Mia approaches a human hand and candle in the distance. She finds herself summoned at a party with a group of youngsters and the hand; she is dead, and one of the partygoers says ""I let you in."" Wilde is engaging in the leading role, Otto gets her moments, and young Bird is most memorable as the possessed boy. Directed by Australian brothers Danny and Michael Philippou who rose to fame as YouTube sensations, it is a simple story of teenagers messing with the spirit world with demonic consequences, it has sharp imagery, small over-the-top moments, and an eerie atmosphere, it could have been scarier, but it is a worthwhile supernatural horror.

"Agree with those that said 'good concept...so so execution'...
i feel it was good throughout most of the movie but didn't have any decent idea on how to end it... how to tie together the loose ends...and so...it went off the tracks...
i'd say watch it half way or a bit more and then make up the rest...do it with friends...one of you is bound to do better than the writers did with the second half... which is too bad because the first half was pretty strong...but, in the end, it seemed to turn out to be a one trick pony...which wasn't a bad movie or album.

"A very good horror movie is nowadays a seldom thing. But Talk To Me is actually great. I was entertained from start to finish. Although there are almost none jumpscares you'll be on the edge of your seat, wanting to see what happens next. The movie offers a new, original and refreshing style to the genre. It is an intense and a mysterious movie and the acting is on point. Some of the scenes are surreal, but these youngsters has a bright future in their acting careers. I honestly believe that Talk To Me could have been a bit longer. I hope they will make a second part, cause I will definitly watch that.",2023-09-13

""I dont want to be alone!""... sure words to be said to get a man to do what you want.. the protector instinct will kick in real fast..the other girl was very boring lolwhy did she never used the hand? Interesting..main girl got me annoyed when she killed her dad.. when riley started getting crazy, she also just froze and went away.. and then with her dad, she scissored his neck and then she just stays there and doesnt even try to help the guy.. really?Dude, max gets stabbed in the neck and like 20min later he is still rolling?

"This lean and mean supernatural horror isn't afraid to get nasty, with some certifiably vicious violence (most of which is, even more disturbingly, self-inflicted) and a couple of gross-out moments that trigger a very different kind of fear reflex to the usual bumps in the night associated with the genre (let's just say that they both involve dogs in their own way). Even though 'Talk To Me (2023)' never even threatens to break new ground in terms of its narrative, with its trauma as horror underpinnings and focus on a group of teens who do very silly things with very dangerous objects, the picture is just really well crafted in pretty much every way. It draws some basic but effective parallels between its central spiritual concept and teenage drug misuse, leaning into the highs and lows associated with taking illegal substances. It's also just a really grubby affair, presenting its terrors in relation not to glossy Hollywood stars but to realistic Aussie kids (even though none of the adult actors come even close to passing for someone still in school). The cinematography is dark without feeling dull, the direction is subtle yet distinct, the performances are heightened yet natural and the scares are expected yet successful. There are a handful of jump scares, but none of them feel cheap and the piece generally favours slow-burning frights than cattle-prod shocks. The plot moves in a generally predictable direction, but it gets there in an enjoyable and occasionally inspired way. It's not interested in even pretending that any of its characters are going to get a particularly happy ending, and there's a sense of dread that escalates as the piece approaches its fatalistic finale. At the same time, it isn't an overly dour experience and a lot of it actually has a chaotically comedic energy. It knows it's ridiculous and sometimes uses ever-so-slightly self-aware humour to highlight this, but it's also as sincere as possible and understands that comedy and horror are two sides of the same coin. Even the most outlandish scenario can soon become utterly terrifying if it's allowed to go on for long enough, and vice versa; the directors know this well, and allow each scene to play out for exactly as long as it needs to in order to remain on the intended side of that equation. The whole thing is just put together really well and you can tell there's a lot of passion behind it. It's ending is also as surprisingly ambiguous as it is satisfying, an inevitable conclusion that sneaks up on you almost silently. Ultimately, this is a really solid slice of supernatural horror that's totally unsentimental about its characters and isn't afraid to get gross. I can't wait to see what the directors do next ('Talk 2 Me', I take it).",2023-08-11
"Any one who knows anything about horror movies knows it's about feeling scared for innocent and vulnerable characters. As far as I could tell, the characters of this movie were not innocent. Far from it. They knew what they were gettting into. It relies too much on music and graphic scenes to frighten, which is simply not enough for an adult audience of this day and age. The film was more to do with shock-gore than shock-horror. I can only imagine the people who highly rated this film must be young and have yet to see many of the classic horror films. The makers could do rewahtching some themselves.",2023-08-13
"Talk to Me is a new horror movie directed, co-written and produced by Danny and Michael Philippou. Both brothers have worked on the 2014 horror film The Babadook and have done other smaller things in the film world. They are also better known for their YouTube channel RackaRacka.Teenagers have discovered a new trend of contacting spirits through a mysterious, embalmed hand. This becomes an addictive thing among teens, who can have fun for under 90 seconds with the ghosts that take over one of them. Only if they do this longer will it have terrifying consequences.With this film, the Philippou brothers clearly show how they managed to break through to become directors of a real cinema film by only working behind the scenes on other films and then making their own films for their YouTube page. For the future, they should now try to come up with some more original films, because despite the fact that this film has a good story, it remains a bit on the familiar side. Movies where people manage to communicate with ghosts in certain ways remains something that has been done before in other horror movies.They do respond well to current events where teenagers often come up with new separate trends and do them with their group of friends, as happened recently with laughing gas, for example. Furthermore, the characters also behave like teenagers, for example by recording everything with smartphones, in order to have images to share on social media.They also know how to portray the film well. The ghosts and their bloody actions come across as believable. The film only lacks some explanation about exactly how the embalmed hand works and how spirits can make contact with it or take over someone with it. They also bring drama sides to the fore, but unfortunately these are not developed strongly enough. If they had focused a bit more on these drama sides and a little less on the teen comedy, the movie could have been a bit better. The ending is also a bit rushed.The acting is also well done by the film cast. Most of the teen group are actually played by teenage actors, most of whom are still at the beginning of their acting careers. Despite this, most know how to put down good, appropriate acting. Most also come across as believable as modern teenagers.",2023-08-20
"This is one of the rare cases i acknowledge that a movie is good but many things bothered me so much, so, i didn't enjoy it.This was too ""evil"" for my taste. Too bleak and sad and hopeless. HEREDITARY is a primary example: An apotheosis of Evil. Yes, HEREDITARY was a horror masterpiece and i've got to admit it. But i don't like these movies. There is enough horror, desperation and apotheosis of Evil in this world. I don't like watching the same things in cinema.Now, i am about to defend TALK TO ME: Anyone who says Mia is unlikeable didn't understand this movie. Mia was possessed FROM THE START. When she passed the 90 seconds rule. That's the reason she insisted Riley should talk to the hand. Because spirits inside her took command of her, wanting to take the boy's soul. I myself didn't realise it at first and i really hated Mia's character, believing she's the true villain here. Because, when you put a boy's life in danger, you are disgusting. But no, it was not Mia anymore. She was also the victim, demons played with her mind all the time.This is a crucial point of this story. If you don't get it, you are gonna root for the Hand.In any case, these are not the most likeable characters ever. They are dumb and brainless and dangerous to each other. But, that's the case when you are young. How many times did we do stupid things when we were young? I definitely had my share. There would be no horror movies if people were wise from their early years :)Good actors, everyone did well. Well directed, too.So, i think this is a great depiction of Evil. In this movie, Evil lured these kids into a trap. This is definitely one of the scariest movies of the last 10-15 years, i really can't understand people who say it is not scary, they are probably fully desensitized. And it's honest. No stupid jump scares, no tricks. Just pure horror.But i can't rate it higher. It didn't entertain me, i didn't enjoy it. Not every movie should have a happy ending, SMILE didn't have a happy ending but i liked it. This, i didn't.This is too sad and bleak for me. But i am not letting my dissatisfaction clouding my judgement. This is also a good horror movie.",2023-10-12
"I appreciated Talk to Me, thankfully, since I actually paid for it in the theater. I was curious about the high ratings and simply hadn't seen a horror film on the big screen in a few months. I was not disappointed, though I also was not wowed or blown away. I don't consider Talk to Me a ten, because you do have to plod through a good 15-20 minutes of Gen Z college kid stuff to get to the good parts. As a Millennial, I look on such films with trepidation, expecting them to be kiddie high school horror. However, Talk to Me has the subtlety of 1970s supernatural horror flick with its ordinary awkward, suffering people who are neither exceptionally beautiful nor wealthy nor popular, but overall just average and sort of likable.Yet there are 90s vibes, younger Gen Z and older Millennials as well as younger Gen X may feel right at home with the way the main characters dress and behave though they have smart phones.None of these homages to the 1970s or 1990s are overt, everything about this film is subtle, in fact so subtle a certain segment of the viewing audience might find it boring or nothing special.However it is this average-ness, this subtlety, that makes Talk to Me genuinely scary. You're there for every moment of chipping Mia's nail polish or agonizing in the hospital over Riley. You start to wonder if people self-destruct due to malignant spirits instead of due to mental illness, a very old theme presented in a refreshingly relatable way.I did not expect the end at all.",2023-08-27
"So many horror films go all out at the end -- breaking any sense of realism or plot to try to get one last big scare out of you... But throughout this whole film, Talk To Me stays grounded & continues with its super-strong edge-of-your-seat story.The way they use mobile phones also feels quite spot on -- The lighting from it is super-compelling too. I wish there was more of Hayley and Joss, they were a uniquely interesting duo.It might feel a little slow to get started for some, but it's a fresh breath of air amongst some pretty boring horror films as of late. Very well done, can't wait to see what the twins do next!",2023-07-27
"Synopsis: When a group of friends discover how to conjure spirits using an embalmed hand, they become hooked on the new thrill, until one of them goes too far and unleashes terrifying supernatural forces. (IMDb)
Talk to Me is a very solid directory debut. However, the film loses it's balance as we progress in the events of the film specifically towards the last act that just loses it all in my opinion and fails to maintain the main story as it feels like the film gets too distracted by trying to be so many things at the same time.The acting in this film maybe the strongest element in which it really has saved the film as a whole. Sophia Wilde as Mia is able to present the different struggles and stages her character goes through as well as the confusion she faces as her character progresses throughout the film.Joe Bird as Riley maybe the star of the film. One particular scene made his picture and acting inside my head gets stuck and those who have seen the film will know which scene i am refereeing to. Miranda Otto as Sue (Mother of Riley and Jade) brought a great sense of humor to the film as she was the centre and the attention of the comedy aspect that the film relied on heavily. Her comments and charisma is very bold and cam be felt in the film.The film started off in such a great way and with no introductions as it got into the story right away. Something that grabs audience members' attention. However, it felt like it lost all of that in the middle and specifically the second act and a bit of the begging of the third act. The story dropped everything that it was building in the beginning and to be more specific, in the first half and went on by something totally different afterwards but was able to bring it back all in the last scene. So what's the point of building all of that in the middle? Towards the middle (and after an important event in the story and before the ending) the film kept going on and on and showing stuff that were very unnecessarily or went on for way too long that made me wonder, how is this supporting the story?As well as the sound mixing snd sound editing that was horrible and made it much harder at times to hear the speech clearly and understand what exactly is being said. However, the film had a few song choices that were very well as the soundtrack really matched the vibe the film has. The film's cinematography has a few shots that were well noticeable and well made that illustrates that dark vibe the film has but i wish if they were illustrated more rather than one or two still shots that are unforgettable.My Rating is 7/10

"Whether or not we get more rounds with this hand of fate, Talk to Me lingers as a striking and confident directorial debut from the Philippous. The movie isn't for those who believe horror movies can easily be shaken off. The film is thematically a bit thin but doesn't stint on genuine scares, intensity or revulsion.The film grabs your attention with verve, but also has a vision: it's not mortal danger it finds freaky, but what's waiting on the other side. More than just a great scream queen, Wilde makes vivid sense of Mia's ravaged emotions, revealing her to be a captive less to the spirit realm than to her own inconsolable grief. She's the movie's revelation. By choosing simplicity over specifics, the filmmakers free themselves from the weight of words and open up space for a mood of intense disquiet and unusual sensitivity.My Rating : 7.5/10.",2023-09-12
"Sorely disappointed in this movie. Many good reviews tempted me to rent this. Much of it was soooooooo slow, more drama than horror. Many of the scenes didn't make ANY sense at all. The acting was good, but it wasn't enough to save this movie. How do their faces, eyes, lips change while touching the hand and then suddenly after 90 seconds everything is back to normal ???? And that scene while in bed...toe sucking wth. I think a much more successful, better movie was The Boogeyman (original story by Stephen King). I think the trailer and reviews were so compelling....booooo. Watch the Boogeyman or Black phone instead.",2023-10-08
"Why is it that everyone can do horror well this century EXCEPT for USA? Australia takes the cake for best horror movie of the year with this one, as far as I am concerned.I am so glad I went and caught a theatrical screening of this before it was out of there. I knew it had potential after the stuff I saw other people saying about it, but, OH MY LORD, this movie hit SO hard in a multitude of ways. The first half was just as funny as it was gripping, while the second half had dramatic elements that were just as powerful as all of its terrifying horror. Talk To Me seamlessly fuses all these genres, adding up to a very intense and gratifying experience overall. And the violent bits were quite a bit more grotesque than I was expecting! Not for the squeamish! And may I add, it does not skimp on its BLEAKNESS. Once it gets heavy, it STAYS heavy!I was very impressed by the entire cast, none of whom I recognized aside from the mother. Everyone's ability to play equal parts comedy, drama, and terror was incredible, and that's also a sign of really good directing. I know nothing about this director otherwise but I'm gonna start paying attention now.There are definitely a couple things I found myself loosely wondering how or why things could work out the way they did, but I don't really think those are worth discrediting the movie for. Talk To Me requires a bit of suspension of disbelief, like much horror, but that's part of what makes it such a blast. It really creates it's own little terrifying world and sucks you right into it.I'm glad this wasn't another Saint Maud (more like Saint Mid). I don't think I've had such a gripping horror movie experience in the theater since probably Midsommar. If people still care about movies AT ALL thirty years from now, this one is gonna be a big-time cult classic.",2023-09-23
"This film is quite an original proposal in the world of horror, though I must admit its not something we haven't seen before.I loved the way they propose a new ""medium"" conduit to establish communication with the death, which in this case is a hand. I also liked the fact that the film was shot in Australia, you don't see much of that nowadays.This movie is totally full of jump scares and moments where you want to close your eyes because of the heavy loud scenes you are watching. I must admit that there is a bit of grotesque terror in case any of you are sensitive to scenes with blood, I normally don't like when filmmakers abuse this resource a lot.The only thing I can say it was not totally cool and that's the reason why I can say it is a 6 is the conclusion of the film. The ending feels a bit incomplete and even seems like there was a lack of budget to finish it, they had a very good idea as a closure but it did not materialize completely with characters that have plot circles that don't close.As I told you, a resounding 6 which is quite good for a film of its genre. Go see it for yourselfs!",2023-08-11
"They said it was too ambitious too scary for the movie well it wasn't very impressive It may have been a successful movie, but it had its shortcomings. In other words, the summoned spirits should have killed them and haunted them, that is, the people who had mixed with the spirits should have gone to mia and brought them back. I would make such a topic, but it was beautiful, it had scary and impressive scenes So was it worth the wait yeah I really liked the mummy's hand. I will do the same. To add it to the horror collection. The plot of each movie is very similar, this movie was different, I liked it, it's worth watching.",2023-09-04
"One thing about scary movies is I'm always trying to be a detective while watching to determine if I can figure out the next scene or the ending. This movie was well down for a movie with a small budget. I would say it was actually scary compare to this top box office titles. Not being able to figure out where the movie is heading is the best part and is what make me entertain. I like this movie to the point I would watch it again but I doubt that will happen because I know how it ends but I would love to see a sequel or maybe a prequel that show the history of the hand itself.This would be a good opportunity to develop a universe surround the hands, the way Insidious or the Final Destination where the movies connect in a way. I just hope cooperate hollywood don't try to milk the living health out of the movie because that always happen when they find a good title.",2023-09-15
"It's hard to make a good horror movie. It's hard to scare people when they expect to be scared. A really good horror movie either is just deeply terrifying and disturbing or hits you on an emotional level. This one fits the latter category. The film had some cool, creepy scenes and nice camera work and transitions. The added component of the emotional trauma of grief and loss took it to another level. The end, although a little predictable, was fitting and appropriate for the context of the film. This was a good one and the best horror movie I've seen probably since His House. Definitely one to watch.",2023-09-04

"This could have and should have been 30 minutes long-the exposition and character development essentially fails and isn't well written or interesting. The thing is the horror genre bar is so insanely low and tired, this seems better than it is. The woke stuff/trans character doesn't add anything and just makes the movie feel dated. Lots slow boring scenes. The possession stuff is kinda cool and somewhat effective but feels like a short film or student film. Borrows lots of stuff from other films and isn't particularly effective at ripping them off. Was hoping it would be more creepy dread instead of the jump scares. Also characters make dumber and dumber decisions once the horror stuff gets underway instead of the entire film so overall the film feels uneven and contrived. Decent cinematography and sound design but the sound mix leaves quite a bit to he desired. The pacing had me checking the running time more than once. There's really just not enough here plot wise and would have been so much better as an anthology film about the mythology of the hand with multiple storylines and characters; the teen actors just aren't compelling and you don't care what happens to them because the exposition is so weak. The film also tonally starts comedic and light, but then it loses this angle completely after the possessions start which makes it feel disjointed, again poor writing and storytelling. This feels like a first film and I wonder just how much the DP contributed to the film's overall competency. If the sardonic fun humor continued, it maybe would be interesting throughout. The weird flashback haunting stuff is kinda cool but it tends to cut away just as it gets really interesting. There are some weird creepy bits but it's often missed opportunities that don't quite make sense. Lots of characters beating on doors and knocking throughout but the motif isn't fleshed out. Motivation for bad decisions by characters both off and onscreen also continuously breaks suspension of disbelief. Some plot points make zero sense. It's far inferior than the trailer makes it seem. Again this could have been a great tales from the crypt episode or something but the writing is just too lazy and empty and vapid to support the weight of the running time and the many slow scenes that serve little to move plot forward. Again better actors maybe could carry such an ok-ish script but zoomers who this is aimed at probably think this yawn fest is good. Instead there's unearned melodrama filler. All of the stabbing stuff is really fake and so impossible it is laughable. The gore isn't over top enough and isn't creepy enough. The makeup and performances of some of the ghost entities is one of the best parts of the film but is only in a couple of quick moments. Fans of the possession genre will like this but if you were expecting something well thought with developed lore, look elsewhere. The pitiful attempts to comment on mental health as insulting as well. The symbolism they do pick to try to convey something to the audience has no payoff and doesn't link to the plot. Not satisfying ending at all and it's so pretentious and pretending to be atmospheric. None of the zoomer characters are responsible for their actions. The adults are nonexistent in their spheres of influence and the believability is zero. This movie has nothing of value to add to the genre or anything of note to say. Again the entire film would have been better as a first act to something more. I guess my expectations were far too high.",2023-10-09

"A bunch of dumb teenagers decide to replace drugs with possession as the new nightly recreational activity. The rules are simple: hold the outreaching embalmed hand and you will see the dead. Letting them possess you for under sixty seconds leads to an intense high that can rival the hardest drugs. If the possession goes above a minute, you might be in trouble. Mia has never been good at social activities and feels uncomfortable in large crowds. Still, that has never stopped her from hanging out with her best friend, Jade and following her into whatever nightly activities she is into. One such night led to the introduction of the hand after which Mia found herself being a willing participant quite regularly. Everything seemed fine till Jade's younger brother ends up with in the hospital in a coma and serious injuries after being possessed for too long. Things start spiraling out of control when she starts seeing the dead enter her dream and take control of her body without permission and even worse when one of them claims to be her recently deceased mother hinting towards a conspiracy involved in her death.Switching the ouija board for an embalmed hand is different but not enough to be believable or any less ridiculous for a bunch of frat house rejects to prefer over booze and drugs. For the most part the acting and production quality are fine but I didn't find the movie doing anything unique to be memorable than a by the numbers horror. If anything, the events resolve a little too quickly and nothing is really explored. By the time Mia starts to realize her predicament, the movie ends. Its not terrible but its also not something I would recommend watching in the theaters.",2023-10-19

"Directed by Danny and Michael Philippou. Co-written by Danny Philippou. A runtime of one hour and thirty-five minutes. With an R rating.In Australia, a group of teenagers stumbles on the weirdest thing. What looks like a sculpture of a single arm with an open hand. This hand gets given to ""Joss"" played by Chris Alosio. ""Joss"" and his friend ""Hayley"" played by Zoe Terakes are the cool kids you could say at school. They use this hand as a party trick.See what I didn't tell you is when you grab this hand and repeat the words ""talk to me"" you get a connection with a spirit. Then when you utter the sentence ""let me in"" you let the spirit take over your body. The goal is to never go over a couple of minutes with the spirit inside of you. They're grave consequences if you do.""Jade"" played by Alexandra Jensen, her best friend ""Mia"" played by Sophie Wade, ""Sophie's"" boyfriend ""Daniel"" played by Otis Dhanji and even her younger brother ""Riley"" played by Joe Bird are all witnesses to this hand's supernatural connection.After the initial scare of seeing a dead spirit in front of you when you first grab the hand and say those words, give you a rush like no other. After ""Sophie's"" mother ""Sue"" played by Miranda Otto goes to work.""Sophie"" trying to fit in invites ""Hayley"", ""Joss"" and her small inner circle to have a supernatural party of sorts. They will all find out the consequences of holding the hand too long. As well as what happens when you try to play with spirits because all of them aren't good. In this eerie supernatural film.The ""Talk to Me"" trailer was scarier than that actual film. I thought this was a possession film at first but it was a little more than that. Like who has fun letting spirits/demons take over their body? That doesn't sound like fun at all. I have family in Australia I will be calling them to ask them about these weird tendencies.I found the film creepy and weird more than scary. Like you see these spirits making you do the oddest things and you want more. On top of that, an observation is if you have some messed up stuff that happened in your life you should probably stay clear away from something like this.The fact certain characters couldn't put two and two together to see the obvious issues annoyed me. Even if you're seeing a family member, they didn't look or sound that odd before their passing. Why would they portray something demonic now? Hmmm here's a guess maybe because they are.Between the multiple weird scenes. The ending felt rushed and half-heartily explained. The very end was cool giving you an OH SNAP moment but the directors could have transitioned that way better. Because the film didn't cost much and it's making a ton of money. A sequel was recently approved.The concept as a whole and the very end of the film could make for a good sequel. There are ingredients in this to do it. The question is will they though? I guess that will be left to be seen. I give this film three mor fires 🔥🔥🔥.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin

"I usually dont like to see horror movies, but the only ones I do like are the ones that creep under my skin, the ones where it's not the monster itself, but the fear OF some creepy monster that unnerves. THIS is such a movie.The good: I must applaud the contineous unnerving vibe this movie unleashed upon me as a viewer. It really was quite effective at creating a creepy, maniacal vibe.More good: beautiful photography, with (fortunately) no silly CGI tricks, but instead rather real looking special effects that look quite daunting.The actors arent terrific, but the one leading actress is certainly very good at her role of someone who gets possesed.Probably not suited for the more casual viewer, because this movie is not a comical horror movie, but a rather nasty and creepy one, but THAT is it's undeniable power!",2023-09-30

Nothing very shocking, but it's a pretty good horror not many people would walk away from disappointed.Wouldn't go as far as saying it was ground breaking or amazing. But def worth a watch.Although this was done on quite small budget, you couldn't really tell, and i'd be really interested to see what the people making it could do on a full scale one.Although the story kinda felt like it came to a halt a couple of times, and there were certain storylines it started to explore needlessly, the action kept going and ending was quite good.",2023-10-13
"Good acting, but nothing new or unique in my opinon. Hardly any scare scenes and rarely a jump moment.The film for me lacked a level of substance. It had a very slow burn to begin with and I sat there waiting for it to kick into action. When it did, the storyline was good, however it did not hold my attention. I wish i could give it a better score, however it just didn't do it for me. The 90 minutes maybe should have been closer to 2 hours to allow for a more robust dialogue.I left the cinema feeling it was ok, but would I have paid to watch it on the big screen with hindsight, the answer is probably no.",2023-07-29
"FILM: 7.5/10.Talk to Me marks the feature debut of the Phillipou brothers, the brains behind the RackaRacka YouTube channel. Stepping into the well-trodden territory of possession horror, the film manages to carve out its own unique niche while maintaining a sense of familiarity.From the get-go, the movie sets an eerie and disturbing tone that grips you. As a fan of the horror genre, I appreciate the fresh take on possession, and the Phillipou brothers' skillful direction creates an unsettling atmosphere that keeps me engaged. The dialogue from the kids occasionally feels a bit out of touch with the latest trends, but it's a minor quibble in the grand scheme.One standout aspect is the brothers' willingness to explore various facets of horror. Instead of relying solely on jump scares and predictable shocks, they expertly weave together gore, psychological twists, and moments of gross-out horror. It's a commendably diverse approach which keeps the scares fresh and interesting.As much as I was drawn into the first half, the film falters a bit in the second. The tension and energy of the beginning don't quite hold up, and that's a bit of a letdown. But credit where it's due-the Phillipou brothers are unafraid to flip the script. They're injecting unpredictability into the narrative, and in a sea of cookie-cutter blockbusters, that's refreshing.With a runtime of 95 minutes, Talk to Me manages to make an impact, even if the concept loses a bit of steam around the hour mark. Despite this, the ending picks up the pace and brings back some of the lost momentum, saving the day.In a world inundated with horror films, Talk to Me stands out with its unique blend of unsettling atmosphere, innovative horror elements, and the boldness to defy expectations. While not flawless, it's a solid addition to the genre and a promising debut from the Phillipou brothers. I look forward to seeing what these local lads come up with next.FORMAT: CinemaVIDEO: 10/10.4K theatrical presentation, Detail level: Excellent, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Excellent, Encode: Excellent, Master condition: ExcellentAUDIO: 9/10.Theatrical Dolby Digital audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Excellent, Surround sound presentation: Good, LFE content: GoodMOOFIEMETER: 8/10.",2023-08-09

"Writers/Directors Danny and Michael Phillippou know exactly how to disconnect an audience to it's characters. Creating hate for the semi protagonist is not a smart approach and always leads no where.The path these so called screenwriters chose was almost as if they wanted an audience to walk out based on the sheer stupidity these characters were forced to act. There were a million ways this could have been written to accomplish the same result.Although Lead Actress, Sophie Wilde, did a decent job...her performance didnt gain any new following. Think Joffrey from GoT.Im surprised A24 backed this but the production was good, acting was good (for what it was worth) and cinematography was ok. Will not be watching anything from Phillippou ever again.Dont pay or even stream this...",2023-10-11
"Movie is not good at all. I do not know how much the budget is, but it is clear that they did not pay much for it. It did not convince me as a story. There is no goal or pleasure in watching it, and the actors were also at their worst. I do not recommend watching the movie, wasting your time on it, there is no point in watching it, there is no A story, no plot, and no persuasion by the actors. I expected that the commercial films ended, but this film proved to me that the commercial films still exist. Why all this unjustified and useless effort? The production and director are requested to make an effort to find a new convincing story and more convincing actors than these .",2023-08-13
"Talk To Me is actually rather good when it comes to the storyline and the horror aspect of the film. The acting performances are also really good, in fact the only shortcoming of the movie is the characters being ridiculously stupid rather then making the logical decision. To be fair though a horror movie can only be made if the characters consistently make stupid decisions so can't really fault them for that either I guess.The story follows a group of Australian teenagers who use a mummified sort of hand to connect to the other side. To them it's a game though and they talk to and let the spirits in before closing the door to the other side and sending the spirits back, or so they think. Things start to get crazy when they start seeing spirits everywhere and one of them even starts communicating with her dead mother. A very interesting story and really enjoyable as well.The casting was pretty good though I have no clue who any of the actors or actresses are. Still they all gave good performances and made the movie enjoyable and that's what's important in the end.VFX and SFX were also really good with the spirits, seeing the other side and the possessions etc. Really smoothly done actually.Overall a really enjoyable movie, a solid and well deserved 8/10 from me. Good story, great cast and awesome special effects. Though I am still waiting for the day we get a horror movie where the characters are also logical and don't do stupid things.",2023-09-24
"I watched about 45 minutes and then I was compelled to turn it off. Nothing whatsoever about ""TALK TO ME"" appealed to me. I couldn't relate to the characters. The dialogue sounded much like mush mouthed chatters and ramblings. The main character was extremely boring and weak. The frustration I experienced while watching the first 45 minutes made me realize that there was no hope for redemption and it would be a pointless waste and an exercise in futility to continue. Perhaps most pre-teens and teens will love TALK TO ME because they can relate to the shallow characters but for me I hated this ""horror"" film more than words can describe. 1 star out of 10.",2023-09-29
"I had high expectations from this after reading a lot of the reviews on here, so when i saw this was out i was ready for this new entertaining horror that a lot of people were raving about. I sat down and watched it last night, so here's my take on it. I guess i'm getting old as i didn't feel the hype surrounding this, it was okay at best and i didn't think it was scary one bit. What exactly happens to make this so highly rated?, i kept thinking is anything going to happen and then it ends. Guess some are going to think this is great but i can't be the only one who was left wondering what all the fuss is about.",2023-09-12
"I honestly believed 'Talk to Me' was going to be just another possession movie. But this Australian possession horror is so fresh and unique, it is an entirely new twist on the genre.In a way, its also a new take on the Ouija board game. Instead of the board game, they have an eerie embalmed hand, which apparently is a real hand. No-one knows exactly where the hand comes from, but there's speculation it was the hand of a medium who could communicate with the dead.Now youngsters play a dangerous game of ""Touch the Hand"". The 'player' holds the hand and then says ""Talk to Me"", upon which they are able to see a spirit, or ghost. When they then say ""I let you in"", the spirit temporarily possesses the player. Only, the possession should not last more than 90 seconds, after which the player must let go of the hand.Having seen such a possession video clip on their social group chat, Mia (Sophie Wilde) and Jade (Alexandra Jensen) decide to go see for themselves whether it is real. Jade's 14-year old brother, Riley (Joe Bird) tags along.At the party, Mia decides to go first. She goes over 90 seconds before breaking the connection, after which she is ecstatic, saying it was ""awesome"". During the film's first few moments, the boisterous youngsters are shown having fun playing the game, but things soon spin out of control for them, endangering their very lives.'Talk to Me' is the type of film that grabs you, and doesn't let go. The viewer is glued to the screen, craving more, eagerly anticipating the next step - and the next reveal. The film has an amazing script, with stellar performances by an excellent cast - especially Olivia Wilde and Joe Bird. I actually never expected the film to be this disturbing on so many levels. It goes well beyond the possession element.'Talk to Me' plays with the viewers emotions in an unsympathetic way. It is cruel and relentless, but incredibly realistic with relatable characters. I don't think I've ever seen such a disturbing AND emotional possession movie. 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' has been my favourite possession movie since seeing it for the first time back in 2005, and 'Talk to Me' now also rate among my favourites in the genre.",2023-09-14
"Minimal review needed for this flick, and I'm sticking with dull. It never really got going. Concept was intriguing, but it just turned in to a sixth sense with gore.Other than the character Jade, everything felt amateurish and well, just an awful movie. I kept hoping that at some point there would be something just to propel this hunk along but, meh.A lot of average performances, a plot that never really progressed and just a slight bizarre movie throughout. With a like more attention to the storyline as opposed to making teenagers invoking spirits and making light and you probably have the bones of a reasonable movie.It's neither one thing or another and safe to say if won't be a repeat watch 4/10.",2023-10-04
"I don't even understand how this is getting such good reviews. This was the WORST HORROR FILM IVE EVER SEEN. ""Oh yeah let's get possessed and laugh about it."" The characters are annoying and unrelatable. Stupid concept. Poor execution. A24 tries way too hard. Poor acting. I can't even believe I sat through this. I was praying so much for it to get better. It just kept getting worse. It's so far fetched. I don't know what kind of teenagers would see each other getting possessed and turn it into a game. This was like a Saturday Night Live Skit. Awful. Awful. Awful. Don't waste your time on this one.",2023-10-04
"I wanted to enjoy this more than i did, review after review said that this was the ""rebirth of horror"".If you want to compare Talk to Me to the other ""Horror movies"" released this year, yes. Then it's by far the best. But it's nothing more than a tired Jacobs Ladder boilerplate, but with a haunted totem as the basis of the story.The ""hand"" symbolize addiction is clever and actually the best part of the movie. It is a refreshing take on the ""Teens experimenting with potentially dangerous substances"".But the plot is tired, every bad thing that happens in the movie is the protagonists fault. The actress do a great job, and her scene of possession is by far the best scare of the film.It's tiresome and generic that she is to blame for everything that happens, she learns nothing. And get's no consequences or repercussions for her actions. She is to blame that one major character almost dies, to self inflicted injuries. She was told to never approach this person again, which is a realistic response.Just to moments later being told that she is forgiven, and that his injuries which literally puts him in a coma, apparently was told off as a ""psychotic episode"".Later she almost kills her father by stabbing her, get's no blame for it.The movie is not scary, filmmakers needs to stop depict ghosts as old people vodered in dirt. Just stop, and the only other scare is the film is a foot fetish jumpscare. Not even kidding.The klimax is more or less a badly made clone of the ending of Jacob's Ladder.One of the praises this movie have gotten is that it makes an excellent use of it's ""low budget"". 4.5 million USD is not low for a horror movie, less a indie horror.Just recent examples: X was made on a budget of 1 million USD, and had way better practical effects than Talk to Me. Talk to me barely had any effects at all to speak of.One Cut of the Dead is barely a horror film, but technically a comedy horror. And it was made on 20k USD equivalent.Talk to me is a great entryway into more challenging horror movies. But it is a clichéd snore for experienced horror fans.",2023-09-24

"I saw this film at the San Diego Comic Con Premiere and By the end of the film I was in complete shock, the film's Runtime is a bit over 95 Mins but it does such a great job in that time period that it leaves room for a potential Sequel or even a Prequel. The directors knew what they were doing. It's been a long time since I have ever seen a film That makes me want to write a review about it. I'm really glad I saw this film and what next film the directors will make next.A24 was really smart in taking this film and adding it to its Horror Collection. I look forward to buying this film in 4K sometime in the future.",2023-07-21
"Danny and Michael Phillippiou's debut feature doesn't sport the most original concept as genre fans will be able to detect traces of THE EVIL DEAD, RINGU and CANDYMAN among others in Danny's screenplay (co-written with Bill Hinzman) about an embalmed hand with the power, when summoned, to possess a person. What elevates this Australian horror film is that is doesn't rely solely on jump scares and loud music stings. It's genuinely creepy. The brothers Phillippiou play fair with the viewer and follow its premise from beginning to end. They also display a sly wit which tactically disarms the viewer before going in for the.....you know what.The cast lead by Sophie Wilde and Sunny Johnson is young and energetic. Aaron McLisky's camera is fluid but controlled, and Cornel Wilczek's music doesn't get in the way by being too omnipresent. As mentioned,, the script doesn't break any new ground, but, it's smart in the right places and doesn't insult the intelligence of the viewer. Producers Kristina Ceyton and Samantha Jennings performed the same function on THE BABADOOK and their taste shows as do the talents of the Phillippiou brothers.",2023-08-18
"This movie is very good, the story telling , the acting , the realistic characters and the plot!I love how they did not involved any religion at all. It has a strong message regarding addictions and drugs. How teenagers can be lost forever of they give in into this world .The make up is masterful , great violent scenes ! The representation of suffering in the spirit world was very scary and graphic, one of the best I've seenIt's been a long time since I enjoy a great new, original horror film !This is a must for any horror fan I will keep track of any work this director has planned for the future.",2023-08-17
"Well very disappointing, Not scary, boring! The conversations are clunky. The characters are unlikable. The acting is dismal there reactions to what's going on is not what would happen in reality.The very basic concept sounds great but that's where anything that can be considered remotely good stops. Really does not have anything going for it as a film or a horror! No jump scares, no gore, no suspense, nothing just flat and bland, kind of like watching neighbours or home and away!Anyway I am running out of adjectives to describe this poor movie. Oh there's a new one to help hit the mandatory 600 word count!",2023-10-24
"I've loved horror for 30 years now, ever since I saw Night of the Living Dead (my favorite horror film) when I was 7. It gave me nightmares that night that I still remember vividly. And I know ever since the late 90's, we've gotten 3 or 4 big studio boilerplate horror movies per year that were ""the scariest movie since The Exorcist"" that don't even stick with you til you get out of the theater. But I will say with the utmost confidence, this is the MOST PERFECT horror film since Kubrick's The Shining in 1980.Incredibly, this film DOES NOT rely on lame, interchangeable JUMP SCARES! Every single big budget horror movie since that girl's face in the closet in The Ring has been 70% jump scares, with atmosphere, story, acting, etc all crammed into the remaining 30% of the film...((Think about the definition of a jump scare""... The score drops out and you get 3-5 seconds of total silence, then something appears really fast and the score comes back in twice as loud... That's not ""scary"", it's just ""startling"". If someone jumps out at you from around a corner, do you feel ""terror"" and ""frightened"" the rest of the day? No. Your heart only beats fast because it was unexpected and jarring.))...This film is infinitely more cerebral and atmospheric. The ""horror"" comes from the situation, the tension, the atmosphere, the stakes, etc as it's supposed to, not just from things popping up behind characters (strangely, where only the audience can see), so all that credit goes to directors Danny & Michael Philippou for having a vision of a wholly original horror film and implementing it perfectly.The acting, also, really sells the story as well because the characters are realistic and have distinct personalities, not just two-dimensional static cut-outs. Sophie Wilde, specifically, deserves notice because she's the reason that you get so drawn in to what's happening on the screen... Her non-verbal acting is incredible, being able to convey such a wide array of emotions and feelings just by slight changes in her facial expressions.Giving anymore details than what's already in the trailer would be ruining (in my opinion) the absolute best horror film of the last 43 years, soI will just point out, when the ratings on IMDB are all either 2-3/10 or 9-10/10, you can guarantee it's going to be great if you're a fan of creative, original concepts with thought put into them, rather than ""the #1 movie in America thrill ride feel good coming of age comedy of the summer holiday season"" that's out this week because all the reviewers giving low scores most likely want to see more Hangover or Annabelle or Fast & Furious or whatever turd Kevin Hart and Adam Sandler are dropping this month... You know, people that ""don't wanna haveta think too much""...",2023-09-17

The performances are all top-notch, with Goth giving a particularly memorable turn as the lead. The film's visual style is also impressive, with the filmmakers creating a truly creepy and unsettling atmosphere.However, what really sets Talk to Me apart from other horror films is its originality. The film takes a familiar premise and twists it in a way that feels fresh and new. The filmmakers also do a great job of exploring the psychological implications of the story, making it more than just a simple scarefest.Overall, Talk to Me is a must-see for fans of horror films.

"Is it a good movie. Yeah. Is it the best movie. No. Is it a fun movie to watch. Yeah. People wana compare it to hereditary. I don't know why. A24 has nothing to do with the making of this or hereditary. A24 is mainly distribution. Just like in hereditarys car scene. Just like the exorcists crucifix scene. This movie attempts something like that with the little kid. Was it effective? Kinda. Made us all stop talking and watch just like those other scenes did. Was it as impactful or memorable? Absolutely NOT! They make it a thing like ""she was in there longer for 90 second"" at the end like we didn't notice that. This movie thinks the audience is stupid. It's trying to be clever (which it wasn't. It was predictable) it's a good movie though, definitely worth a watch. But I wouldn't by the Blu-ray or anything. It's not a mediocre movie either. It's a bit.... Tiny bit unique. But predictable. Everyone knew she wasn't talking to her mother. It's not a big revelation like the movie makes it. The movie things were dumb. The filmmakers and writers of this movie think we're dumb and they're so clever.",2023-10-24
Warning: This movie contains really disturbing scenes and visuals. Therefore I do not reccomend you watching it alone at night. Higher your expectations of getting scared so your adrenaline level keeps you calmer during some parts in this A24 horror masterpiece.Best part of this film is its flawless sound editing and SFX... Directing and acting are other good aspects. Its dramatic arc is a little predictable but come on this isn't drama genre so no problemo chico... This is some new school hardcore horror genre. I would call it Neo-horror.Do not show it to your teenager siblings please. It can really harm their psyche. A solid 8.5/10.,2023-09-07
"I made the mistake to watch this idiotic Australian movie suggested by my clearly not so stable mentally friend, this movie with a low budget and with very annoying and messed up teenagers as so called actors which was a joke. The acting is bad, there is no logic, why only some people get in trouble while others who were involved too just disappeared from the story and have nothing else to show . As always it focuses on someone who's parent died pathetic and expected. And it focuses on someone who is losing it and going crazy, becoming a killer. What a pathetic movie with a pathetic and expected ending.",2023-10-19
"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I mean.. What is with everybody, you people can't tell that THIS was a bad movie? How could anyone think this film was good.. It's so mind boggingly stupid, any person that has a single brain cell will be sitting though going ""People think this is good?"" I guess horror films are just bad now, and it's just the way it is. This movie isn't even a horror film, it's a typical 2023 effort where there is really no plot or anything. It's just people hanging out, wow, what an amazing story! People hanging out, whoa, riveting! Jesus man what happened to films?.....",2023-10-22
The twist and turn of this movie is unbelievable!! I loved every second of it!! Brilliant story start to finish!! Definitely recommend to see this!! The jumpscares and tensity is excellent. Make more movies like this please!!. Very dark and worth the watch!! Very moving and touching too. I'm so excited to see it again! My favourite horror movie in 2023 so far. I almost turned my head away from the screen from how the jumpscares were like. Very creepy aswell. I had goosebumps all throughout the movie. I've never felt like this ever in a horror movie before. Like I said before brilliant movie!!!,2023-07-24
"So far, this is one of the most controversial movies in terms of ratings, as I see people who are praising it and people who are hating. Well, I think both sides have a point.Let us start with the praise: in the era that we all agree that horror movies are in crisis, this movie has come up with a new spin to get out of reheating in the microwave what has been done thousand times. Summoning the dead is one of the main themes in horror movies, and being able to innovate on it is already an achievement. Imagining a new way to connect with spirits is what makes this movie interesting. And unfortunately, that is about it.This takes us now to the people hating it: everything else about the movie it's just average to say the least. The main plot is very predictable. The acting is okayish. The movie gets really slow right after the beginning. The movie ends up mixing the teenage hype with experience without any creativity. I even found some of the plot decisions unreasonable.To conclude, let us perhaps give this movie a shot just because of the innovation, but do not expect too much because you'll be disappointed very quickly. If you like watching teenagers talking to the dead without any interesting or twisting plot development, then you can enjoy this movie.",2023-10-09

"I was skeptical of this one I must say, the trailers made it look like some cheap Netflix type film with annoying Gen Z Characters with modern dialogue to appeal to that crowd & to insult the other, but no! This was good! Not amazing, but good!The film follows a group of friends who discover how to conjure spirits using an embalmed hand! Like a new TikTok Trend, they become hooked on it & muck around with it for quite a bit! But, as expected, they push things too far & unleash a terrifying batch of supernatural forces!I found the film to be pretty good! I was skeptical about it & was thinking it would be rubbish or ok & that's it, but it was actually decent! The Trailer for the film doesn't do it justice! My mate said the same thing! I was expecting the film to be a cheap Netflix type flick with annoying Gen Z Type Characters who have controversial opinions & views in exchange for good horror, but here, it's not the case! The film actually was good & didn't go a joke!The scares & supernatural elements were pretty good & scary looking! Nothing that I haven't seen before, but all the same great! The story is a little out there & despite the good visuals (gruesome & gory at times), it did go off the rails & fizzle out by the end, almost like the filmmakers gave up!The characters are as you'd expect from the previews, they're not exactly likable as such despite a couple who are ok! The pacing & runtime are good here with the film lasting 1 hour & 31 minutes! Even for a low budget horror film created by YouTubers known by their channel, RackaRacka, this was a good attempt, though there is room for improvement! The story & its conclusion to the dragged out dialogue scenes & the sound mixing! I will say the opening was pretty ace & surprising!Overall, it's a pretty good film! Better than I thought considering! It's not amazing, but in comparison to Horrors not only this year but last year in 2022, this is actually not bad at all! Despite the story being a little out there, the concept is ace! The characters are mostly annoying (though, not as bad as I thought), the ending 3rd act felt like a bit of a give up & the sound mixing was off in areas, but, despite that the scares & visuals were good as well as gory & gruesome! Despite it's ""out there"" ending & questionable choices made by the characters, it's a very good paced, 91 minute supernatural slasher horror film! Give this a watch!7/10.",2023-07-28
"I can easily say that this is one of the best horror film experiences I've had in a long time or even ever, I was very satisfied as the credits rolled at the end.Most horror genre films these days lack character building and making them relatable and down to earth for the viewers and rely on very cheap and cliché jumpscares that get old really quick, this film does the opposite of everything I've mentioned, for once, the characters actually feel real, you can sympathize with their struggles and all actors have done a very great job of conveying that especially Mia which was played by Sophie Wilde.Sound design and audio effects was masterfully used in this film as it was specifically made to be watched in a cinema.The ending was dark and very satisfying, I was happy with it.Before going into this film, I saw the high ratings and good reviews it received but I was kinda skeptical about liking it because the same thing happened with the black phone and I ended up not liking it, but with this one it's 100% to watch it especially on the big screen.This was my first time not looking up who the director was for this film before watching it and I only realized that the directors were Michael and Danny from RackaRacka, I grew up watching their skits and funny videos and I was even more satisfied seeing them make their first official horror film on the big screen.",2023-08-16
"Well, one thing's for sure: the Philippou brothers (Danny & Michael) clearly know their way around when it comes to setting up a spooky atmosphere in modern times. The technology of the 21st century is quite integral to the plot, and the writers cleverly blend this with the present-day-teenager obsessions of dares and pranks, sometimes forgetting how dangerous they can turn out to be. The film starts off with something that's viralworthy, but it soon shifts to the protagonist Mia, suffering from the trauma of her mother's passing, alongside her best friends Jade and Riley. The first 30 minutes, or so, had me double-checking whether it was a horror-comedy: it plays out like a series of YouTube videos, though conceived in a thoroughly cinematic way; a mixture of millisecond jumpscares followed by laughs. I don't want to get into the details of how the brothers execute the first act, but it's really engaging, to say the last.It's around the 45-minute-mark that things take a brutal turn. Here's that one scene (like the decapitation scene in Hereditary) everyone's going to be talking about for a long time. Not only is it disturbing in its own right, but it also made my eye twitch. The spectacular sound design and practical effects really elevate it to the next level. It's a clear STANDOUT. While the plot that follows carried less of an emotional impact, including the trope of a friendly spirit (ultimately turning malevolent), the staging remains consistently solid. The atmospherics, the lead performances (especially Sophie Wilde), and the special effects (all within a $4.5 mn budget) are appreciable. While the climax works from a crafting standpoint, I wished the storytelling payoff was just as good. I'll keep an eye out (pun intended, for those who've watched) for the sequel!",2023-09-12
"This movie kept me on my toes the entire time. I love the new unknown actors, each character was flawed, and it was obvious. The foreshadowing and the solution was right in front of them the entire time. And the whole story went in full circle. I love how to use a red herring to Miss Guide the viewers. Several people left the movie because it was too intense. It is hard to write this without spoilers, but this movie is worth watching . A lot of taboo things happened that wouldn't be seen in traditional American horror . I love how they pushed the limit. Overall recommend and can't wait to see part 2.",2023-08-04
"I think it was a wasted concept and could have been executed better. Pacing was weird and the movie didnt really explain much. Maybe it should have been longer, more in-depth. One person stated it was just about a ""mostly white"" first and foremost poc here and I really dont care its nice to see diversity but I am not sure how its relevant to the quality of the plot and secondly are you blind? Over half the cast were poc...either way, the actors executed their parts well. I think the direction was all over the place. Like if mom commits suicide, why was she struggling for help scratching the door? Miranda Ottos character was super aggressive jeez, why would anyone want to hang out at their house? Who lets their young boy out to a teenage party your older daughter is sneaking out to? Who stays friends with a girl that talks about your bf like that? Why does the spirit attack the boy and no one else? It was set in a weird manner, not aligned with reality so it makes the supernatural unnoticeable. I think the actors were just fine despite the criticism but you can only do what your directed to do. I think they should try the concept again in another film and maybe elaborate on its origin and what the spirits are trying to do?",2023-09-17
"'Talk to me' is a fresh spin on the posession genre; young people who have fun talking to the dead and having themselves possessed. It's weird having a movie that tries to ground itself very much in reality that simultaneously doesn't acknowledge that having a consistent way to talk to spirits would be a pretty major thing. During the movie the posessions are filmed and put on the web (which is the very reason the main group of characters get interested in it in the first place). You'd think that the two accomodators of 'the hand' would've connected the dots and made a pretty penny by auctioning it or whatnot. It's also hard to fathom that nobody would, after Riley's (the kid brother) hospitalization, would not just say 'yes, the problem is this magic spirit hand here, try it yourself and you'll see what I mean'.But okay, it's a horror film and thus I shouldn't be so anal about such things. It's a fun premise and I was mostly engaged in the proceedings, although the dumb decisions Mia kept making were somewhat annoying. But again, I can't help but mention that if I felt like I was going mad, I'd probably get that magic hand to a psychologist and/or a physicist quite quickly. I suppose there's an analogy here that has to do with drug abuse, especially after the posession party in Jade's house where it's like a bong party at one time, with everyone blasting off.The effects are well done, especially the facial features of Mia were pretty darn creepy in posesssion mode. There's very few jumpscares, which I appreciate a lot, as the tension is thus more spread throughout the film.The ending scene is also very fitting, although I do hope they won't start pumping out sequels now.7.5/10.",2023-09-15
"The movie I recently watched was fairly commendable. It presented a compelling narrative, artfully woven together to hold the viewer's interest throughout its duration. The story was intricate, filled with twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat, consistently surprising and always engaging.Moreover, the makeup and aesthetics were impressive, adding a significant layer to the overall visual experience. The painstaking detail put into every prosthetic, the subtle transformation of actors into their characters through the magic of makeup was indeed breathtaking.However, the movie also contained elements that were shocking, eliciting strong emotional responses. This added a layer of unpredictability to the viewing experience, making it more than just a passive activity.Despite the above strengths, I found one aspect of the movie difficult to overlook: the cast. In comparison to the actors from the 90s, who were generally attractive, fit, and brought a certain level of charisma and appeal to the screen, the actors in this movie seemed to lack those qualities.These actors, it seemed, were selected with a different criterion in mind. Some of them had an unappealing aesthetic, with hairstyles that could generously be described as 'unfortunate'. Their look was further marred by bulging eyes that seemed more likely to elicit unease than empathy from the audience.Overall, while the actors were able to convincingly embody their characters, their physical appearances diverged greatly from the conventional attractiveness often associated with Hollywood. This deviation was jarring, and it detracted from the overall enjoyment of the film, giving the viewer an element of distraction that was hard to ignore.",2023-07-30
"I feel like I am the only person that thought this movie was below average and lackluster. Being an A24 film, it's stylish, with great cinematography and overall good acting. But I thought most of the characters were unlikable and the story felt hollow. It felt like it was taking bits and pieces from other horror movies that it thought would work to formulate another good horror movie. The practical effects are excellent and I always appreciate the use of less CGI which helps ground any film in more realism. The movie also tries to have a deeper message and metaphors, but these also fall apart with the story telling. By the end it felt forgettable. I wanted to like it but sadly it's a dud for me.",2023-08-11
"This may not be the newest story line but it certainly gives it a new breath of fresh air to the new horror genre.We have been lacking this kind of movies since Hollywood only cares about making the same old tale with the same characters and very predictable ending to movies.I went in with high hopes and left the theaters really happy because this brought some new moves we desire to see, it obviously isn't perfect, for instance, when Riley hurts himself badly accusing the ghost to be her mother's, they could've considered it to be a demon, because why would her mom hut him like that. It failed on that matter, but in every other part of the movie it gave me plenty of satisfaction and agony. Koodos to all of them.",2023-08-18
"A group of young people like to party with a mysterious amputated hand. They play a game where they hold the hand and say the phrases, ""Talk to Me"", and ""I Let You In"". The participant becomes possessed by a spirit which is akin to a drug high. Mia is still struggling with the lost of her mother and has clung onto her friend Jade. Sue (Miranda Otto) is the mother of Jade and Riley.This is an Australian indie horror. Horror is the genre well suited for a simple idea to go big. That's what we have here. It's a simple campfire horror story and it's so good. I like the characters. I wasn't sold on Mia at first, but I could see the potential. I would have wanted a bit more on her background although the movie does well to drop a couple of clues. Quite frankly, she's better as an orphan. Her big scene with her father could be done with Sue. Ultimately, I love the premise, the characters, and the execution of a well-earned personal struggle.",2023-09-28
"(SPOILERS)
I might not say the best but okay. Talking to ghost, not a big concept. But the method they came up with is pretty cool. By giving hand to a statue of hand and telling talk to me is pretty cool scenes. Only negative I can say is, this movie drags. Way too many boring elements. I mean scenes like talking to show what happened. For example at the last scene where she dies and gives hand to another fellow. It was to long for me. My opinion. And the story, it's actually awesome. The acting felt like weird. But the direction is way to awesome. Enjoyed watching. Expecting more horror movie like this.",2023-09-26
"I have seen a lot of horror movies and many of them are full of jumpscares and boredom without any actual story.Talk to Me is a nicely executed horror movie which rather than relying on jumpscares, has a proper story which is both indulging and grasps you from the start till the end. The story felt fresh, the screenplay was good with proper execution, the direction was good and the performances were also good. The whole story was nicely covered in given runtime with nice suspense and an unexpected climax.Overall, I would recommend you to give this horror flick a try. You will enjoy watching it.",2023-09-12
"I watched the film with fairly high expectations based on the trailer and the hype around the movie and was only slightly disappointed.The film takes elements from teen movies like Scream and others from The Conjuring, which is refreshing. There are some high-intensity scenes, only a few gory scenes and some more psychologizing and traumatic scenes involving the main characters, but the film struggles to find a clear path between these three styles and touches on everything.On the good side, the lead actress is really good, special effects were perfect and made the movie look a lot more expensive than it actually is.The ending is satisfying and calls for a sequel and I'm up for it!",2023-10-10
"Talk to Me is a horror movie directed by the Rackaracka brothers. It is their directorial debut, and it simply doesn't feel that way. It is a well written and directed film.The movie has a great concept to it, with the porcelain hand that can be used to communicate with spirits. In the way it portrayed it can be seen as a metaphor for drugs which was really clever. It has an intriguing mystery surrounding the lead character's mom which is mirrored with her character arc in a surprising way.On the horror aspects, the movie doesn't rely on jump scares. It has some sequences that builds tension in an effective way and has some shocking payoff moments which can be disturbing at times. There are some great practical effects which were used to achieve this.All the performances from the actors are great, especially the actors who played Mia and Riley.As for the issues, there are some plot points in the film which were not resolved by the end. I guess the directors were leaving some of them for audience interpretation. In that case it didn't fully work for me.The specific point where the movie ends probably won't work for everyone. For me, I appreciated what they were trying to do with the story.Overall, this movie has a unique take on a familiar premise. It is more unsettling than horrifying which is rare when it comes to modern horror movies. A must watch for horror fans.",2023-10-17
"Supernatural storytelling mixed with a touch of paranormal realism made ""Talk To Me"" feel like one of the most memorable occult recipes Australian cinema has cooked up in recent years.We've all grown up talking to our friends about the possibility of conjuring spirits and demons from the 'beyond'. This movie brought such early-years memories back by creating characters who felt rooted in reality and not in over-the-top horror-genre ways.The 'evil' at the heart of the plot was a mysterious plaster-cast hand that somehow seemed capable of creating inter-dimensional rifts that could summon dark entities into the Earth plane.It was all fun and games for a group of young girls and boys, until the fun stopped and the real games began. As shocking as it was gruesome, the movie made a compelling case that we should never invite something that cannot be sent away.In this regard, ""Talk To Me"" also enlivened an all too familiar fear among humans. That if we stare into the abyss, the abyss most assuredly will stare back.The team took a simple story and made it surreal, giving it plenty of supernatural twists that deserve to be appreciated.Most people think Hollywood is the only real player in the horror genre. But select fans, like myself, are aware that Australian filmmakers are capable contenders. ""Talk To Me"" made that case for me.I loved all the performances, they were so natural and relatable. It didn't feel slapped on or over-dramatic, just human and in the moment.Also, the way they portrayed casual possessions in the early portions of the movie and the use of a waist belt evoked drug abuse. In an interesting way, it seemed occultism was the new 'high' among kids these days.Some medical records do state that people who take 'shrooms' or other psychedelic substances have reported seeing the 'other side' - no drug endorsement here, just stating plain facts.All these elements were so naturally woven into the plot that it created a small lake of parallels and possibilities, enriching ""Talk To Me"" with new layers of social subtext and relevant meaning.I most especially admired everything they did with the plaster-cast hand - the embalmed hand of a person exposed to dark paranormal forces, apparently. If the Addams Family's Thing character had a diabolical twin, this one would be it.Holding its own in a small sea of horror movies that released this year, ""Talk To Me"" was a fine example of spooky storytelling with a flair for being unapologetically dark.",2023-09-15
"It's disappointing so many people were bored by a films attempt to tell a more layered sorry and perhaps that's why the majority of horror these days are terrible. Anyway, from a pair who only made YouTube videos before we have a deeply unsettling film. It is interesting that it is really about the grief of loss and how the power of the hand exploits this in people to gain a footing.There is indeed a slow build, which is called character development and when it kicks into high gear (you'll know the scene when you get to it) it never lets up.Please, please ignore the people with no attention span and give this one a solid try.",2023-09-16
"Great horror film here! If you don't like horror/thriller movies, then do yourself a favor and don't watch. I'll never understand why people who don't even like these types of movies watch them just to give poor reviews. It doesn't reflect it well for others who do like the horror genre. Sooooooo, this movie does have some expected things that happen, but it is still entertaining! There is a little gore and there were a couple parts that made me go oooo no no no, nope. Lol. Overall without giving it all away, it's definitely worth the watch. The acting was superb and you could really feel from everyone in the movie, all of the different emotions that were in play; that just made it so much more gut wrenching in my opinion. This will be fun trying to sleep tonight. Enjoy the movie!",2023-09-17
"A24, for the most part, has been consistent with their specific releases when it comes to the horror genre. With the likes of Ari Aster's Hereditary, Robert Eggers's The Lighthouse, Kevin Smith's Tusk and Rose Glass's Saint Maud, if there is one thing in common as well as most of the films by the said studio not part of the genre, they are not afraid to take risks. In fact, while admittedly using the familiar horror tropes audience are used to seeing but they innovate them and make it as their own - just like Talk to Me.Talk to Me is, by far, the creepiest and interesting film of 2023. Aside from Beau is Afraid which is bonkers, Talk to Me features the typical scenario as presented by Aster's Hereditary in how people use the power of exorcism and supernatural force in order to overcome grief. However, the film was able to stand on its own by actually creating a scenario of how teenagers use the creepy hand as something for fun - until it goes too far.In terms of the cast, everyone performed well in their respective roles. Never did they feel as pretenders but rather real people. But the actor that stood out the most was definitely Sophia Wilde as Mia. Her character is someone the audience can relate to, not just because of the grief that she is trying to overcome but as to how she reacts to the horrific sequences that is happening to her and the people that are close to her.The best thing from this film is unlike generic horror movies, it does not rely too much on the jump scares. In fact, just like Hereditary, it is the creepy vibes, disturbing imagery and unexpected gore scenes that boosts the film's horror vibes. It does not have a lot of exposition which is good considering not everything has to be spoon-fed to the audience.As for the story, it presents an allegory of addiction (not necessarily drugs) and how it is used to overcome the depression and loneliness felt. At the beginning, it starts out slow, trying to know the characters through their conversations. But the film picks up once the hand is presented, how it influences Mia's choice and the effect of it all. From there on, the film does not hold back with its horrific elements. Despite the final act could have been better, it was an overall solid horror film.Talk to Me is finally that horror movie that people who are fans of the genre should definitely watch in the cinema. Want something bold and original? Then this is the film that should earn more recognition.",2023-07-29
The story is good and amazing. Feels like a bit low budget movie and also the story feels like abrupt but still worth watching if you are a horror fan. Does it's job to scare you at sometime but after certain time feels like story has lost it's way and then you feel like what the heck is going on. A good potential plot lost because of short time of movie. They could have made it slightly lengthy and explained origin behind hand/artifact and created more screams in doing so. Still a good short movie with scares and interesting storyline but feels like end is unsatisfactory and being a horror fan expected more to it. A one time good watch.,2023-10-21
"I suppose the premise had some degree of potential, if handled well; which it is not in this film.Really annoying how everyone in the film was so gullible about believing everything that the spirit entities told them, especially the Mia character. None of the characters had the least skepticism about either the genuineness of the phenomenon or the truth value of what the spirits conveyed to them.What is really disappointing about this film is that, if this is what the actual youth of Australia are like today, then they are really a bunch of worthless idiots!! To think that a supernatural experience is merely some new induced state of intoxicated ecstasy says something very disturbing about the upcoming generation of Australians!It leaves very little to hope for in the future!",2023-10-21
"A semi interesting horror thriller with touches of good acting, semi convoluted flow, vibe and convincing visual effects and minimalistic computer generated imagery.The first half before the hospital mishmash effects is way better and begged for a stronger, bloodier and gut wrenching second half that never came and happened.The ending and the little shocking cliffhanger is just there for an unpleasant sequel that would probably never happen.Also, the ceramic coated hand origin and how they came in possession of was never really explained. It would have been great if the movie added fifteen minutes plus of runtime in a prologue to thrillingy explain it and excite us viewers more with satisfied open mouths.Screenplay/storyline: 6

"I'm shocked. Like actually shocked. I didn't see a single piece of marketing for this movie, I was just browsing the Cineworld app and ""ooh there's a knew horror movie out lets have a look..."" IT WAS SO GOOD!The cinematography was very good, the acting was AMAZING, the story was actually investing since the characters were also great and the horror: oh my days the horror. First of all, yeah there are jumpscares but that's not why the horror is good, it's the aesthetic that makes this whole situation so disturbing. I tensed up during so many scenes even when there wasn't anything exactly ""scary"" going on. The fire was also great and once again added to the disturbing feel of this movie. I'm still just baffled that I didn't see a single piece of advertisement and it felt so unique and engaging compared to other movies that have released this year.And WOW THE ENDING WAS SO GOOD! It wasn't exactly a plot twist but it still shocking nonetheless!As much as I'm giving this movie positives there were still a few issues. Some parts of the script felt very random and characters just kinda said things because the plot demands it. But really that's about it. I guess it had a fairly slow start but I'm used to that when watching these type of horror movies.Overall just a great movie. Definitely not absolutely groundbreaking but I think my bar can be way too high for any movie to reach that. 8/10 definitely a must watch.",2023-07-30
"Guiding the viewers by hand straight into the dark depths of the abyss, Talk to Me is one of the genuinely frightening works of horror to surface in recent years. It takes a familiar concept and concocts a never-ending nightmare from it by making the most of its sinister setup, foreboding aura, spine-chilling sound design, impressive practical effects and solid performances from its young cast.Directed by Danny & Michael Philippou, the story concerns a group of teenagers who find a way to contact spirits by using a mysterious embalmed hand until one of them takes things a tad too far. Gripping us with fear & shock from the get-go, the film silently builds to the event that starts the chain reaction of horror & suffering, and offers plenty of thrills, scares, twists & terror before bringing the journey full circle.The script does put some effort into our protagonist's past trauma & present grief which makes her actions somewhat understandable and Sophia Wilde renders her part with finesse. The rest are just as good and help keep us invested in the unfolding mystery. But it's the smart execution of the technical aspects where this film earns maximum points, the highlight being its top-notch sound that has an edge-of-the-seat intensity.Overall, Talk to Me is arguably the scariest film of the year and has all the qualities of an instant classic, which it is destined to be. A spectacular start for its first-time directors that adds a new spin on a classic formula to deliver the nerve-wracking experience that will make your blood run cold, this Aussie chiller is as unnerving as it is hair-raising and refuses to hold back when things go haywire. One of the best surprises of the year. Highly recommended.",2023-08-25
"This film is about a somewhat troubled young adult woman who has recently lost her mother to suicide who has been lashing out and taking wreck less risks that end up causing even more tragedy to herself and those around her. This is not a happy movie! That said the acting is acceptable for these young newcomers. Its the story that itself is scary..
Wreckless teenagers manage to get their hands on a powerful occult artifact that allows them to contact the dead, and even allow them to inhabit their body for a short time. The downside here is that the spirits she makes contact with are all evil and rotten to the core and just itching to lash out and hurt, maim and kill the living. There is a rule that if you use the object for longer than 30 seconds that you risk danger to yourself and those around you. Of course our protagonist manages to stay possessed far longer than the cutoff time of 30 seconds and her life turns into a haunted hell for herself and those around her.Once our protagonist gives permission to her younger step-brother to use it, it nearly kills him leaving him close to death and with his face permanently scarred for life. It only gets worse from here as apparitions of her dead mother start to appear, but guess what? They aren't really her mother. This film is scary, has a new and unused angle that it brings to the horror genre so its not some remake of a remake with stale ideas. That alone makes this a good film to watch, just dont watch it alone!",2023-09-18
"One of those independant films, not big budget, but unusually these days, has an interesting storyDramatic (and violent) start gets you hooked from the get go and thereafter you are drawn ever deeper into the ghostly (and gruesome) storyThis was a well made film and an entertain watch if you like the graphic horror (with a good story) genreNot much more to say without revealing the story, which has shades of 'the monkeys paw' if you remember that . I would give this a very solid 7.5/10. Good enought to watch more than once .I forecast a sequel in due course and I hope they don't ruin the premis in doing so.",2023-07-28
"Is to put an animal out of its misery also to acknowledge the misery of our loved ones, and their own justifications? It seems like a stretch, but aside from human philosophy and our own values, who's to say?This film destroys the idea that a story needs to encompass one topic alone in order to be cohesive and engaging. Addiction, peer pressure, depression, loneliness - all so beautifully and tastefully done.I can't commend the Philippou brothers enough for what they've accomplished in making their vision a reality. The editing, performances, cinematography, sound design, all of it form the most visceral horror I've seen since Hereditary.",2023-07-31

"""Talk to Me"" is an absolute must-see for horror enthusiasts. I was captivated by its heavy drama atmosphere, which created an intense and immersive experience. The smart cinematography added an extra layer of depth to the film, enhancing its overall impact. What really stood out for me was just how creepy the movie was - it kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. Without a doubt,In my humble opinion, ""Talk to Me"" is undeniably the horror film of the year 2023. It's a haunting masterpiece that not only delivers spine-chilling scares but also explores complex emotions and human psychology. This film is a must-see for any horror enthusiast and anyone who appreciates exceptional filmmaking. ""Talk to Me"" is an unforgettable journey into the depths of fear and drama, and I can't recommend it enough.",2023-09-12
"Im still not convinced by the movie and im pretty disappointed: the movie start pretty strong with that man who killed another guy in the party but everything get slower, boring and it really lack of interest at least my interest.I admit that i enjoyed the part we talk about the main character family and how her mum's death was kind of mysterious: i really love that part to be honest. The Make up was really well made too with the effect when they took the hands and get possessed. But after all that, it become a little boring and i found the movie quite hard to get my eyes on and i still didnt understand the ending: so is that the main character possessed the whole time during a party or something? I dont know but i didnt really try to find out because i really didnt get into it. We have also that comedy part that i found ok but damn! How we can start this way and make the movie talk really about nothing except superficial things. Its really pretty implicit too and i had hard time to understand. Its not really that complex but i ended pretty confused from what i saw and get uninterested for that. Also some pretty useless talks mostly at the beginning but i can a little bit more deep but not enough in my taste and i found that they used too much jumpscares and less a kind of an ambience or mood who really make us uncomfrotable. So yeah dont talk to me!",2023-10-30
"The movie had heaps of potential from the casting and the thought of the story line.CGI and makeup were good as they should have been for a budget of 4.5m.I would consider this a thriller over anything else, I'm sure there is or could be a second one being made as how it ended but hoping they go down a different thought of how it needs to play out and the fright factor needs to be ramped upBut my opinion is my own and I'm sure everyone believes it's a horror and was scary. I've watched enough of them to know a horror when I see it, but second one could have potential.It'll most likely be a dragged on version of the kid still seeing things and seeing Mia again.",2023-07-29
"Not on my radar for my 2023 film expectations was seeing an instant genre classic from Australian born Youtube sensations RackaRacka, aka twin brothers from Adelaide Danny and Michael Philippou.Proving that with the the right amount of imagination, skill and energy Australian filmmakers and filmmaking can match it with the best, the Philippou's have alongside their distribution collaborators A24 (once more marking themselves down as the kings of unique features) crafted one of the modern eras best Aussie offerings as well as one of the most unnerving and effective horror entries of recent times.No strangers to the horror space thanks to their extensive work on short Youtube offerings that put the directors on the international radar, the Philippou's enlisted the support of The Babadook's Causeway Films to help them guide a young and mostly inexperienced local cast through an experience that may appear on paper to be yet another horror by numbers jump scare fest that becomes anything but thanks to a range of impressive factors.Founded around newcomer Sophie Wilde's instant star-making turn as the inwardly tormented Mia, a teenage girl whose still trying to overcome the recent death of her mother, Talk to Me follows Mia and her school friends experiences with a seemingly supernatural embalmed hand that gives them opportunities to welcome in spirits from the world of the dead but also opening them up to the dark side of that mysterious realm that could have horrific impacts on their lives and mental state.Saying much more about the way in which Talk to Me unfolds or how the story progresses throughout a sharp and never less than engaging 90 minute runtime would ruin elements of the Philippou's feature that calls to mind components of recent horror successes Hereditary and The Witch, if in no other way in which it mines the same type of feeling of dread and unease across its narrative that steers clear from easy scares or predictability to become something that feels fresh, dangerous and exciting.From the moment the film opens with an impressive tracking shot that will have audiences shocked from the get-go, Talk to Me maintains a rapid, unrelenting and smartly designed pace and design, filled with solid turns from it's mostly young cast and remaining constantly outside of doing what many other films would do as an easy out, the Philippou's film isn't exactly easy viewing but it's essential viewing, with its worldwide success a great moment for Australian cinema and a shining beacon as to what can be done here by making a local film that doesn't have to feel like a pale imitator of Hollywood productions or creaky DIY efforts.Final Say -The horror film of 2023 is here and its coming from a source close to home. Talk to Me is a film that will get under your skin and not let up from start to finish, creating an unpredictable and suspenseful offering, heralding in the Philippou brothers as the hottest property on the Australian filmmaking scene, who we should all be very excited by as their journey takes off.4 1/2 RVCA t-shirts out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",2023-10-01
"A group of friends have discovered a new party trick whereby when they hold a recently acquired severed, mummified hand and say 'Talk to Me' a spirit will appear. Say then 'I let you in' and the spirit takes you over which the friends must control by severing the connection within 90 seconds. Seen as something of a high to start with, when Mia (Sophie Wilde) realises that the spirit of her beloved dead mother has taken over the body of a friend she keeps things going for longer than the permitted 90 seconds with unpleasant results.Well crafted and really quite nasty supernatural horror film which does get under your skin largely because of the well written story of a girl struggling following the loss of her beloved mother, coupled with some infrequent but quite disturbingly unpleasant scenes as the cast essentially battle with the underworld. Wilde is strong in the lead with good support all around particularly from Miranda Otto. Troubling / serious late night chills, this is disturbing stuff.",2023-10-29
"This is a scary movie, but makes no sense and just draws random events together. Not realistic at all. I get it is a low budget film, but they could have spent more time making sure the movie flowed without trying too hard to make it scary. Definitely a disappointment.I did appreciate the general idea if the movie, the actors all did a great job. I loved the aching and the general idea of the movie. It would have been way better if they wouldn't have turned it into a science fiction halfway through showing the characters as old people, I think all watchers got the idea of Riley being trapped with spirits without the spectacle. It would have saved money on movie production, as well.",2023-08-02
"When I first saw this movie alone I was like WTF am I watching. Felt as if I was watching a B grade movie which caught my attention. That attention lead me to watch the whole movie and can say it was a good movie for a horror movie. When I see ratings for any types of movie from IMDB, i would usually ignore ratings of 3-5. Usually horror movies are not known to get high ratings. I will only watch a movie that has at least 5.7 and up ratings. So for a horror movie to be rated in the mid 7s during the time I seen it, I had to watch. Just the plot is something new instead of haunted houses or movie about anything with exorcisms. Just have an open mind and take the movie for what it is. Don't nitpick at everything and you will enjoy it. I told my wife to watch it and she even enjoyed.",2023-10-05
"I don't normally write reviews, but I just can't ignore this one. In my opinion, Talk To Me is not only horror movie of the year, but is one of the best horror movies I have ever seen in my life. It was creepy, brutal, badass, and had my heart racing. The concept is unique and refreshing.The execution was exceptionally impressive all across the board. The writing, directing, editing, cinematography, sound design, and visual effects were all top notch. The ending was mind blowing and devastating, but absolutely perfect. I haven't left a theater feeling like that since Hereditary.Huge props to Michael and Daniel Philippou. I've been watching their channel, RackaRacka, since I was a kid. It's so satisfying to see how much they have grown from making crazy action videos on YouTube to a whole cinematic masterpiece such as this.If you are a horror fan, please don't miss out on this!",2023-07-27
"Oooooh my goodness! This was a solid one. Very different from the usual horror flicks and I really really enjoyed it. Am definitely sure any horror fan out there will also enjoy this one. Yes, you still have the clique, a bunch of teens doing dumb stuff, but this one was quite exciting, different like I said and it really got me scared for a moment. It's not a slasher but one of those creepy spiritual/demonic ones so if you have a problem with that, stay away.I must say the acting was pretty good, not only from the lead but from all the supporting cast too. And that opening scene, my goodness. It was so chilling.Now that the good is out the way, unfortunately there is just one bad. The ending. It just didn't feel like a great climax. It felt like they didn't know what else to do so let's just put something together and run with it. The was no explanation as to how things were happening, how she was doing all that she did and it just got messed up really fast.Aside that, great movie. Can't wait for the sequel.",2023-09-14
"...well not exactly but it was the best title that I could think of for this impressive supernatural horror from Down Under (Australia). A group of teenagers are able to contact the dead by holding an embalmed hand and saying ""Talk to Me"" followed by ""I let you in"", it's a bit of fun at first but soon spirals into an horrific nightmare. This makes a very interesting alternative to the usual Ouija board shenanigans. In the opening scene we get hit with our first shock plus our first taste of the cool banging soundtrack that pops up throughout the film. The movie was made on a relatively small budget but the acting is very good and the many special effects are incredibly gruesome (in the UK it is rated BBFC 15 but don't be fooled by that, this movie will please most gore fans). As is so often the case the ""teens"" are played by actors who are obviously older. Lead Sophie Wilde as Mia was 25 but given her fantastic performance I can easily overlook that. Talk to Me is a genuinely creepy movie though the butch Hayley (Zoe Terakes) was at least as scary as any of the spirits! I have to admit that the ending was quite predictable but it ended with a bang none the less. I really enjoyed watching this on the big screen at a local cinema, for their directing debut Danny and Michael Philippou are two names that should hopefully be worth looking out for in the future. Their debut is a fantastic alternative to the heaps of horror movie dross that America churns out.",2023-11-01
"""Talk to Me"" is that rare horror movie that compelled me to watch it a second time to pick up on what I'd missed. I haven't had that since ""Midsommar"".Watching it again, I saw how sleek the production is, how little dead weight it has, and how fast it moves along.I liked it a lot the first time, and even more so the second. I noticed some subtle touches, such as it happening twice that characters are asked to close doors, but they leave them open.Is this an allusion to the movie's themes of opening doors to the unknown, and not being able to close them?They know to say ""I let you in"", but how about ""You can go now""?The reckless teenagers in the cast don't even think about it.The séance the characters engage in is actually very reminiscent of experimenting with drugs for the first time. Note the way it happens at parties, mostly around the young, who are scared but intrigued. The guy pulling the embalmed hand out of his backpack where it was hiding reminded me of somebody smuggling a bong into a high-school get together.And of course the séance, like a drug, takes your sanity. It makes you confused as to who or what is real. And it makes you hurt those close to you, whether meaning to or not.The blink-and-you'll-miss-it twist ending, was quite shocking to me, and very smart.I was already going to rewatch the movie before that hit. It really made me want to pay attention.""Talk to Me"" is a horror classic, but get this? It's Australian and so am I. But I had no idea about that going in.Why don't we big up our own products? I thought that ""cultural cringe"" crap was supposed to be over in the '90s.",2023-10-31
"I saw Talk to Me, starring Sophie Wilde-You Don't Know Me_tv, Eden_tv; Alexandra Jensen-Frayed_tv, Amazing Grace_tv; Joe Bird-First Day_tv, Rabbit and Miranda Otto-24: Legacy_tv, the Lord of the Rings movies.This is a horror movie from down under. It was filmed in South Australia and has the usual jump scares that most horror films have but the story is a little different. Sophie and Alexandra are best friends that attend a party where they get to play an unusual game. The host of the party obtained a petrified left arm that they claim is a bridge to the spirit world. A person just lights a candle, then holds the hand and says, Talk to me! Then, the person will see a spirit and be able to talk to them but-for some reason-they can only hold the hand for 90 seconds. If they continue longer than the 90 seconds, something bad will happen to them. Of course, that's what happens when Alexandra's little brother, Joe, wants to play and he hangs on to the embalmed appendage for 2 minutes. When Joe ends up in the hospital, Miranda-Joe & Alexandra's mother-blames Sophie for letting Joe play the game in the first place. Sophie tries to set things right by playing with the hand more and you can probably guess that it's not a good idea.It's rated R for bloody violence, language, sexual situations-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 35 minutes.This would be a good one to stream.",2023-07-31
"""Talk To Me"" (2023) is an impeccable directorial debut, a film that splendidly intertwines horror with a poignant exploration of mental health torment. It is an original, smart, and stylish horror film that sets a new bar for the genre. The pacing is masterfully handled, allowing the tension to build steadily without feeling rushed. The audience is given time to soak in the dread, making the horror even more palpable. This controlled pacing avoids rushing the narrative, ensuring the unfolding horror feels all the more real and impactful.Sophie Wilde delivers an unforgettable performance that is as scary as it is vulnerable. She draws the viewer into her world of fear and anxiety, making her character's descent into madness unnervingly believable. Her portrayal captivates the audience, making the horror and fear her character endures palpable.The film employs visual horror, gross-out moments, and anxiety horror to great effect, adding to the overall atmosphere of unease. It leans into visual horror and gross-out moments that are far from gratuitous. These elements serve to intensify the atmosphere of anxiety horror, brilliantly illustrating the mental health torment and the horror that stems from it.""Talk To Me"" brilliantly explores mental health torment through its horror lens. The film is both scary and unsettling, creating an atmosphere that is pure genre bliss. It is unrelenting, and twisty, and balances its gloriously sickening antics with genuine emotion, creating a horror experience that is as moving as it is terrifying.The film steers clear of cheap jump scares, choosing instead to rely on a creeping sense of dread that builds to a crescendo of terror. The ending is unpredictable and offers an impactful conclusion to the story. However, it does feel slightly rushed and could have used more explanation. Despite this minor flaw, the ending remains effective and should be appreciated by viewers who understand its subtleties.""Talk To Me"" discusses themes of family trauma, grief, and loss, providing a deeper layer to the horror narrative. The influence of ""Hereditary"" on the film's horror style is evident, yet it still maintains its own unique voice. Ultimately, ""Talk To Me"" is a disturbing and unsettling meditation on grief and loss. Despite a minor issue with the rushed ending, it stands as a commendable debut and a significant contribution to the horror genre.Definitely a must-watch film of 2023. A24 never disappoints in providing quality films, especially in the horror genre.",2023-08-06
"I don't know what's wrong with people doing such movies.Great potentiel but the downfall was greater than what I've expected.Don't watch it with your family (like family night stuff)
This movie is NOT scary they just decided to put disgusting stuff (and I ain't even talking about the « dead » people here) - if you know, you know-.The zoophilia scene was enough for me to make up my mind about the whole film and the producers mindsets.The editing is good, the actors are fine but some things should NOT be allowed and even LEGAL.I couldn't even finish my meal after this.The dialogs were also obscene.I'm not a prude but some thing are just way out of line.",2023-09-21
"Sophie Wilde is nothing short of a revelation here. She reminded me so much of Daniel Kaluuya in ""Get Out""; I'm not trying to compare, make no mistake, even If I want to, I could not because, thematically, these two films are different to each other. All I am saying is that the way Daniel played, or should I say, 'owned' his part in that movie, Sophie did the same thing here.The way Sophie carried her character, as well as the entire film, on her shoulders demands recognition. If you put her out of this equation, the movie would not have garnered even half the appreciation it had thus far; that's the kind of impact she had on it.Now, as far as the story is concerned, it was quite persuasive and allowed you to ponder the various themes it explored, or at least strive to. If only the other characters (other than our main protagonist) had a similar impact, such as Mia's, the writing, on the whole, would have had a bigger implication on me, I reckon.I liked Riley, though (played brilliantly by Joe Bird); that whole bathroom scene sent shivers down my spine!",2023-09-21

"First up, this is probably the best horror film of the year.This is what horror fans have been missing. A really well written, well acted and legitimately disturbing horror movie that doesn't pander to it's audience.Talk to me starts out with a bang and paces itself really well. It explains just enough to make you want to know more, but doesn't over explain so much that it ruins any atmosphere or mystique that it tries to build. The scares here are well earned because they are created through a rich atmosphere and actually terrifying scenes, instead of relying on jump scares, dare I say almost 'old school' in nature.This has a vibe like Exorcist III, where it's very, very creepy and you never feel at ease at any time watching the movie. The violence is so sudden, intense and startling when it occurs, that you can't ever let your guard down, which I loved.I don't want to give any spoilers away about this movie, because it's so refreshing. I saw this in theatres and think the high fi sound really benefits from seeing it this way, but watch it however you can, and keep the lights on after.",2023-08-22
"While I was excited about the concept of this movie, a highly anticipated release among horror genre enthusiasts, I found it to be somewhat underwhelming. Despite a promising start, with the potential for truly terrifying events, the story seemed to lose its momentum as it progressed. It left me wondering why it followed such a repetitive and oscillating pattern throughout.Even though the film had the opportunity to tap into the fear-inducing elements and the story's potential, it didn't fully capitalize on them. However, it's worth mentioning that the movie managed to redeem itself somewhat towards the end, leaving viewers with some intriguing questions to ponder in the moments after the credits rolled.In summary, while the initial concept held great promise, I couldn't help but feel disappointed with the overall execution.",2023-09-15
I found it really refreshing for the horror genre at the moment. There was never a point where I was bored or that I felt the movie was becoming repetitive. Really enjoyed the camera work and thought the acting was superb.I'm not a major horror movie buff because I often find I'm able to convince myself it could never happen to me but with the gen-Z influence I found it hit quite close to home especially with the personal relationship issues. The blatant need to fit in with the cool kids and the peer pressure that comes a long with it is portrayed amazingly well.Should definitely be a must watch on the 2023 list.,2023-07-14
"First of all, when I first watched the official trailer of the movie I really liked it and I was so hyped about that movie. The plot of the movie was very interesting, mysterious and kinda innovative. The storyline was kinda well-written and most parts were well-explained. The characters were very interesting, well-developed and really likeable (especially, the group of friends). The casting was really good, even though most of them weren't well-known actors and their acting was descent. It wasn't a very scary movie, even though there were some jumpscares and creepy moments during the movie. Sadly, there weren't many death scenes on that movie and most of them weren't done onscreen. However, it was a very intense movie and full of chaotic scenes. The opening scene was definitely unpredictable, very fast paced and really promising. The ending scene was definitely unpredictable and kinda shocking. Moreover, the cinematography of the movie was really good and the editing was amazing. Overall, ""Talk to Me"" was a unique horror movie, intense, creepy and I would definitely recommend it to my friends. Last but not least, I'm definitely looking forward for the sequel and I really wish it's gonna be way more explicit than this movie.",2023-09-23
"I had high expectations for this movie, thanks to the captivating trailers I'd seen. However, it didn't quite live up to the hype, though it didn't disappoint either.On the positive side, Sophie Wilde, delivered stellar performance that carried the film. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast didn't consistently match her level of skill and sometimes came across as merely reciting lines.While the film didn't quite deliver on the scare factor, it did offer an intriguing story. The premise was engaging, but the direction fell short in some areas, and a few scenes left me feeling underwhelmed.In summary, this movie is a solid entry in the horror genre and is worth watching, but there's room for improvement.",2023-09-12
"Most horror movies seem to be cut from the same mold, but Talk To Me is an original. Right from the start, you are thrust into the action - and a creepy feeling that things just aren't right. This movie doesn't let up, and it doesn't stop defying what we have all come to expect from horror movies. Talk to Me will do more than just shock you (as most horror movies all do). This movie brings family, friends, and even strangers into the complex web the protagonist (Mia) is dealing with. No spoilers here: the absolute best way to watch Talk to Me is by getting to the theater without a clue about what to expect!. Then hold on!!!",2023-07-30
"It makes a change to see a Australian horror film that is not about serial killers, so this was a nice surprise. Talk to me centers on a group of highschool students that have a party and play a game with a hand to see dead people and get processed by them that gives them a high. It isn't explained wher the embambalmed hand came from. But it must have not been important to the plot. There is also a pre title sequence about a party which is also not answered. Anyway they play the game again and after something happens tp one of the group is might be clear something has latched onto them. I thought this film was executed pretty well. It has a decent cast and overall was alright.",2023-10-27
It's very hard to find an original horror movie these days so I watch this with some intrepedation as very much aware that the latest horror movies have all been remakes so was pleasant surprised at this.No spoilers but couple jump scares and one scene in particular in a hospital looked so real even me a hardened horror film fanatic was like whoah!If possession movies are your thing then give this ago.From the start I was hooked but then there was a little lul right after that which I was almost questioning my first original thought but then picked up and I'm glad I stuck with it.You do actually care about the characters and they all acted the part well.There are some questions which I feel needed to be cleared up but who knows that could be made clear if there is a sequel and I for one hope there is.So recommend and I will be seeing the sequel if indeed they make one.,2023-08-16
"I went in there with low expectations, especially how bad horror movies can be - predictable and a rinse repeat scenario ! For some reason though, this one felt different ! From the visuals, casting and the storyline felt like it all clicked at once !Firstly, the storyline - It highlights the influence of social media and how viewers will realise the psychological effects and the driving factor for people to do the unexpected in order to seek attention and popularity ! It really nails down its objective on getting the message out there ! As for the plot, it was clear where the story was going and felt like a twisted rollercoaster which keeps crashing without really knowing it !The biggest plus of this movie was the cast - the casting choices were excellent and every single of them have performed brilliantly and the chemistry was on point !Overall, it was a brilliantly crafted horror movie and personally a strong contender for the best horror movie of the year !",2023-07-30
"Story:
When a group of friends discover how to conjure spirits using an embalmed hand, they become hooked on the new thrill, until one of them goes too far and unleashes terrifying supernatural forces.Review:
most horror movies look the same however this one is a bit different than the others. Though it may start losing its thrill and horror halfway through the movie, it still kept me entertained. The cast could also be better but its a teenage movie mostly so its alright. I am looking forward to a sequel and i wish they would cast more mature adults in it just for the fun of it.I recommend this movie its been a while since I've seen a horror movie i enjoyed.",2023-09-27
"So far we have received several new horror film releases, some good and others very bad. Among these good films, I don't remember watching any that stood out as much as Talk to Me. This film is not extremely innovative or uses things never seen in cinema before. However, the scenes are very well done and all the technical aspects are good. The story is interesting and has a really cool mystery to follow. Some scenes are very scary or shocking, but on the other hand, some characters are annoying because they make very stupid decisions. The performances are great, even though most of the characters are not interesting or not that well developed. It is indeed the best horror film of 2023, but it is not one of the best of its kind in this decade.",2023-09-15
"I liked the directing and suspense techniques that the filmmakers used and it did well captivating me with those alone. The film had many unique/new ideas and it was neat how they cut back and forth between the spirit and the actual person showing up in the main character's mind/reality respectively. And I really liked how they ended the movie too!There were parts though that felt more silly that funny (like the toe/feet sucking scene). Part of me wanted the movie to go on longer and it didn't really do a good job with making me care about the characters early on. They were written a little bit shallow.Overall, I really love the horror genre and this one felt different. I thought it was alright but perhaps not as ground-breaking as people may end up praising it as.",2023-08-10
"This overall movie had good scenes. The best in my opinion being the ""Hell"" scene. There were times in the movie I felt engaged, but for the most part I found myself wandering. I love horror and A24 but I walked out of this disappointed.The whole premise I took away was like trying a new drug and over time it eats at you and destroys you. Inevitably, your friends and family get sucked in with you and you feel trapped and the only way out is death. The movie did a great job of demonstrating this.Maybe I am missing something and need to give the movie another chance. For a feature film, it's decent. I just expected more for A24.",2023-07-31
"Just watched this today at the cinema and thought it was excellent. The characters were all engaging and well portrayed and rather than rely on jump scares or gore it taps into the more disturbing side of the psyche, delivering a sense of dread throughout. It deals with grief and loss and makes good use of this in terms of the desire to contact the dead and the risks associated should you meet something you're not expecting. It doesn't try to be too clever with twists and turns, just good old fashioned story telling with a very dark side. You can kind of work out the ending about half way through based on some of the script but it didn't take away from the experience. Highly recommended.",2023-08-19
"""Talk to Me"" is a hair-raising experience that explores themes of grief, trauma, and the supernatural in an unsettling and uniquely creative way. Directed by the Philippou brothers and produced by Causeway Films, Bankside Films, and Talk to Me Holdings, this Australian thriller stands as an impressive testament to the capabilities of modern horror cinema.The plot is woven tightly, centered on teenagers Mia and Jade who become involved in a horrifying world of séances and possession. The utilization of the mysterious ceramic hand as a conduit to the spirit world adds an eerie edge to the story, creating a deeply immersive atmosphere.Performance-wise, Sophie Wilde and Joe Bird steal the show. Wilde's portrayal of the troubled Mia is both compelling and empathetic, her struggle with loss and longing for her deceased mother radiating throughout the film. Bird's chilling ""possessed performance"" ranks among the most memorable in recent horror history.The filmmakers' decision to rely on plot and characters rather than heavy special effects or gore adds a level of psychological intensity that resonates with the audience. The practical effects used are impressive, reinforcing the terror without overshadowing the story's emotional core.Set in Adelaide, South Australia, ""Talk to Me"" also showcases the talents and potential of the Australian film industry. The local flavor is subtle yet enriching, grounding the tale in a real-world context that makes the supernatural elements all the more unsettling.Critics and audiences have embraced ""Talk to Me,"" with a Rotten Tomatoes score of 94% and a Metacritic score of 76. The box office returns, grossing $26.1 million worldwide as of August 6, 2023, further validate the film's success.Perhaps the most commendable aspect of ""Talk to Me"" is how it refreshes the age-old concept of possession, grounding it in modern teenage life. The film's exploration of grief and how it can act as a gateway to darker forces is both profound and terrifying.In conclusion, ""Talk to Me"" is a must-watch for horror enthusiasts and those looking for a gripping and emotional cinematic experience. Its unique blend of psychological drama, supernatural horror, and strong performances ensure that it will be remembered as one of the standout horror films of the year.",2023-08-08
"Talk to me (2023) follows a group of teenagers who play with a mysterious hand model that supposedly does cool things. The way it works is that you hold the hand as if you were shaking hands with it and say ""talk to me"" and then ""I let you in"" and it possesses you. If you're in for too long you won't be to get out of it.I loved this movie as it kept me hooked from start to finish and my palms were sweating throughout which is what a great horror should do. It gives a unique take on the possession horror genre and is very creepy.The characters have deep backstories and that plays into the on-screen events.I cannot say enough nice things about this movie so I strongly encourage you go and watch it if you like a good creepy horror that keeps you hooked!Overall, I rate this movie a 10/10 because I have no criticisms about it.",2023-08-18

A24 makes incredible movies, and I really enjoyed this one going into it with very low expectations.The ghosts / demons were scary, and it was one of those movies where they surprise you with many different plot changes. I mean i was not expecting this movie to be this good. It really wasn't bad at all.The ending was the most shocking and jaw dropping part of the movie (there were MANY moments where I was shocked), and my like for this movie pretty much was just completely changed when all of the parts added up to incredible the ending.This movie is HIGHLY recommended by me.",2023-10-16

Story is really not that good as other reviews make it be, nothing new, nothing that we haven't seen hundreds of times. Every single character in the movie is unlikable and it makes terrible decisions. Maybe I'm wrong to criticize so much but as a horror enthusiast I think this really isn't a good movie, especially that it doesn't deserve high rating.",2023-10-16

Lack of flashbacks: 7One of the scariest movies I have ever seen and I rate it down because of that. It's just too scary for my personal liking, but many will find it extremely engaging because of this. Yet this is not all that it fails at so there are other factors making it a bit hard to recommend for just random people. I would say horror fans will absolutely adore it to no end.Firstly the story is a bit amateurish in how it's constructed. At the start for example we just see a random party then move over to another set of characters and another party. Only way later do we learn about the first party and the people there and what happened. So there is an extreme disconnect between various events and scenes and then the plot and characters. Later on all is connected so logically you will feel it's all fine to some degree. Yet the storytelling is not great this way. Similarly we only see the father's face for a few seconds at the end. The movie really doesn't understand how to present characters and events to entice viewers step by step. The whole first act is a giant mess of terrible storytelling and bad camerawork and editing. We largely see faces close up and young adults just talking to each other or whining. A LOT of whining, constantly. Can you handle this for 20 min straight with no plot? The hand is only presented at the end of the first act and only there does the movie start to engage. When we see it the movie picks up pace tenfold and becomes extraordinary for the full second act pretty much until the next big reveal that unfortunately is a letdown logic wise. At least the storytelling never lets up again.At a party when they play with the hand the young brother gets possessed by a spirit and constantly knocks his head against furniture and walls to get to into hell pretty much. The movie started bad then became this cool horror movie and now the police is involved and we mainly are at the hospital in the third act. A third act that jumps the shark. We see outlines of cops and the young adults whisper about how they must not say anything to the adults. Guys... the kid is in a bad way and getting worse you should indeed give doctors all the info they need. It's not like anything can happen to them if they tell the truth and give the doctors or any spirit expert crucial info. There is legit no laws against any of this spiritual play with magical hands. And even if there was they legit felt it was safe as they had done this hundreds of times and it seemed safe. This info could save a life. Yet not a single person gives doctors the crucial info. Even his big sister refuses to talk. And the mom, who seemed obsessed with their safety, does not even ask into it. We just see a few scenes with the mom blaming for Black girl for giving him drugs. Yet the sister herself says no drugs were involved and knows exactly what happened. So why is the mom out of nowhere blaming this Black friend? It makes zero sense unless we assume the sister was at the hospital next to her mom and while the cops were asking questions and doctors trying to save his life she just said ""I plead the fifth"". Obviously this is utter nonsense. The mom would have beat it out of her if it was required. There is no way the sister could just say nothing and then the mom accept it this way and hope the doctors could save her son's life without info about what happened whatsoever. Meanwhile she assumes drugs were involved still so clearly the doctors must have gotten extremely wrong info. This is not just bad storytelling it's lack of storytelling. The movie clearly misses a full chapter here explaining what went on. And the solution they pick to solve this issue is to outright ignore it.Now, with that being said: the close-ups, overly dramatic and whining teens, the lack of adults, stupid young people, the weird characters, the lack of storytelling, the horrible camerawork, the lack of story and logic ALL make the movie way more scary. Sure it's nonsense and makes zero logical sense. But this lack of connection and being able to feel safe anywhere or understand the events make the movie 10 times more scary. It's like watching Silent Hill. That movie had no story and made no sense whatsoever which also made it scary as heck as you couldn't just find a character to seem safe with. But there we at least got good camerawork and editing. Here everything is nonsense to make it more scary. As I said they often don't even show the scenes or people in the room. It's terrible and dirt cheap filmmaking, but for some reason works as a horror. It's clear they just didn't have the money or skills to make it right. They didn't intent this. It's still a mistake they did this, but somehow they saved it in the editing room. Good for them, but they will never make a proper movie.If you are seeking a good plot and complete story you may feel this is only just okay and nothing more. Maybe acceptable. If you are seeking a sleepless night this is it. Right here. This is a movie half the fans will adore and half the audience will feel is a cheap imitation of a proper film. And guess what, the people who give it 5/10 and the people who give it 7/10 are both correct. It depends on what genre you like and what you seek in a movie. Storywise and logically this is a giant fail of course because it doesn't even show crucial scenes and often doesn't even show characters in the scene. But horror wise this is top notch scary.",2023-10-03

"Normally I despise the horror movies that A24 outs out. The Witch, Hereditary and Midsommar are three of the worst movies that I have ever seen. But this movie is a winner.Australia seems to turn out far better actors than America. This young cast was excellent across the board. The last decent American up and comer was Jennifer Lawrence and she's approaching her mid 30s.A supernatural story that has been told 100 times before somehow comes across fresh here. The tension never lets up and there are some brutal scenes that really get to you.The ending was predictable but appropriate and of course leaves the sequel door wide open.Horror movies have been so bad the last ten years so when a good one like Black Phone or this one comes out, it really strikes a chord. Hopefully these directing brothers stick to horror and avoid the inevitable superhero junk movies that they will be offered due to their talent.This must be seen on the big screen to get the full effect. There were only six people at my showing. Hopefully word of mouth prevents this movie from falling through the cracks.",2023-07-29
"Talk to Me (2023) is about a young girl named Mia hanging out with her friends. They all have fun in a room with themselves upon a special hand that they have interactions with. Once you have interactions with the hand, you have a demonic soul possessing you and you can see demonic souls yourself. Until then, Mia can see demonic souls along the way while she is living her everyday lifestyle. She must put a halt to the demonic souls before they fully control her.Overall, I thought it was a good horror film! This was a great dictorial debut with Danny and Michael Philippou, also known as popular YouTubers RackaRacka. Danny and Michael did a great job on building characters and the suspense up for them. I had so much interest into this film that it had great buildup from the beginning to the end. Speaking of the end of the film, I was shocked to see the film end the way that it did. Overall, Talk to Me is good with its acting, suspense, and horror. I would recommend watching it in theaters for a good horror watch.",2023-07-31

"Unlike the cliche horror films that come out these days where there is a lurking supernatural entity that pops up for jump scares, this film is able to capture multiple unsettling and disturbing scenes. The ending of the film leaves you with processing all the events leading up to as soon as the credits start rolling.Although the horror in this film can be quite uncomfortable, this is due to the gore and intensity of the scenes. If you are not a fan of that, I would stay away, but if you're anything like me, these scenes enhance the mood and create that 'heart in mouth' feeling you have, when you finally take that breathe after a confronting and intense scene.This is a must watch if you like horror movies that aren't the typical garbage we tend to see coming out these days, excited to see how this performs once released publicly worldwide.",2023-07-15

Unfortunately once you introduce a mother figure (or in this specific case the actual mother) it tends to lead to a very cliche ""It's my mom, I trust her and would never think it is something else disguised as her to do ill will"".That and to me, the scares didn't seem scary at all but were more on the verge of a nasty type deal which I don't care for. It needed to add more depth in the horror aspect for me to give it a higher rating.Still, a good movie that for people who do not enjoy horror, might have a decent time with this.",2023-07-29
"Mia is still coping up with her mother's suicide 2 years ago. Her best friend's family is giving her the emotional support she requires while she stays distant from her father. Mia and her friends, try the 90sec game with an embalmed hand which let's you talk to spirits and invite them to possess. If the 90sec cycle is broken then the spirit stays. Their fun ends tragically when Mia's best friend's brother Riley gets seriously hurt. What happens to Mia and Riley while they are at the mercy of the spirits forms rest of the story.Talk to Me is an honest attempt at horror genre and it is one of the reason why it leaves a strong impression. The main character is as hopelessly broken as one expects her to be. Spiraling in her own inability to get over her mother's suicide, she keeps pushing herself to the inevitable. It has a terrific first hour, setting the bar high with the perfect dose of horror and violence. It is the last 30mins that ends up being predictable. Even here, there are couple of scenes that stand out especially the climax.It is definitely among the better horror film to release in recent times and the first time directors needs to be lauded for their efforts as the film genuinely succeeds with the scare tactics. The short runtime helps too along with a good performances by the cast. It could've been better if it had reduced the predictability towards the end despite that, it was still a worthy watch.",2023-08-04
".. they didn't explain the hand's inception. Nevertheless, and I watched this on bootleg, 720p, no 4k at all, and I think this movie was pretty interesting.I did not like the short scene of bestiality, but it does add on to the horror, but it was disturbing. At 1 point I didn't care for the teenage characters. Why? The movie presented them in a intolerable manner, but once the youngest teen became ""possess"" then they finally revealed some sympathy and empathy.This probably should've been a series. Why? Because movies, nowadays, have a difficult time explaining the inception of certain plot holes. If the hand was explained then I missed it. Otherwise I just have to imagine it's origins.I liked this movie, and the ending put somethings into perspective. It made me comprehend the opening scene. If the origin could've been explained in a sensible manner I would've gave this film a 9 or 10. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it.Nickeyblack35 at gmail if you wanna discuss my review.",2023-08-02
"The cast and the directors have done an amazing job at this, really left me frozen for a minute after the movie ended.It's hard to believe it's Rackaracka's debut film, they have beaten years of boring, jump-scare infused horror bores and showed them how it's done. I highly recommend watching this in the theatres or on a good sound system at home because the sound effects could make or break the tension for you. The cast is mostly new too and they have done a wild job on the set, it's fun to see new faces who have done the movie justice.Not only does it win in the horror genre, the narrative and story are a good watch for anyone (as long as you are okay with minor gore and horror).Looking forward to more movies from the directors!",2023-08-13
"I really enjoyed the original take on the horror possession sub-genre and where this could've went. There was a lot of potential here, but once ""things"" started happening the movie failed to keep my attention and I quickly became bored. The story was intriguing, but seemed to meander too often instead of getting to the point. I didn't feel a sense of being grabbed and invested into the story and that is something that I need with a movie. Also, this was not scary at all. There were a couple of potentially scary moments, but nothing memorable. Overall, the movie is fine. It's not bad, it's not great. 6/10.",2023-10-16
"Definitely one of the best horror films I have seen all year. I wasn't expecting this movie to be as good as I had originally thought, BUT omg?! This movie had me on the edge of my seat the whole time in the theater. Normally when you think of jump scared you just jump a little with your shoulders...but when I tell you I literally jumped ! FEET on the seat and everything. THIS movie is so good and to anyone thinking of even watching it. JUST DO IT! I'm not over hyping it , I just simply appreciate amazing talent. This movie is just great. Three words to describe it.. unhinged, disturbing, amazing!",2023-08-03
"Talk to me is a modern day horror set in Australia. We find ourselves chilling with Gen Zers who like to u out, uparty and post on social media. They come across an embalmed hand and find a way to get a temporary high by connecting with the spirUit world. All is well as long as they that they connect for too long...Talk to me is a well-made horror that touched on a number of themes including Loss, suicide, fitting in, letting go/holding on and drugs. The acting is well - Each character had their own unique but believable personality notwithstanding that fact that we've seen some similar personalities within the genre before.The 1hr 35mins runtime isn't any more than was necessary. The $4.5m dollar was put to good use with convincing practical effects which manages to give you chills without multiple jump scares and a soundtrack that paid homage to Australian Hip Hop and drill.Give it a watch If you are a fan of horror, a24 or Australian drill.",2023-08-16
"Talk to Me is another very solid A24 horror film with a lot of good elements, but didn't quite live up to the hype for me. Sophia Wilde is excellent and probably the best part of the film. Miranda Otto is great too and it's nice to see her here, I haven't seen much of what she's done since The Lord of the Rings but I've always thought she was great. The visual design of the movie is really good, very effective scares and camerawork. Good practical makeup effects. It looks very good for its budget.The supporting cast is decent but some of the characters are a bit one-dimensional and underwritten. They could have done more with at least 5 of them to make them just a little bit more interesting. They way the characters treat the hand and their reactions to some things that happen in the story don't always add up for me. For example they just let Mia walk away with the hand at one point and don't do anything? They mention once that they could destroy the hand but nobody ever tries. It looks like it would break if a possessed person hit it very hard on a table, but this doesn't happen either.They let themselves get possessed and driven to horrific acts by what seem by the end to be evil demons, and not regular ghosts, but then the final scene negates that entirely when we see a character's ghost getting summoned by a group of people with the hand, inexplicably in another country. How did the hand get there? How did anyone know how to operate the hand in the first place, or that it would do anything? Who's hand was it? Why are the police in this film so incredibly useless? How much control do the demons have?A character goes to kill someone as a mercy killing, as instructed by the demons, but they also for some reason leave behind another loved one bleeding to death and don't call an ambulance. Another character finds said person bleeding and doesn't call an ambulance either or stay to help. Their fate remains oddly mysterious. A character is removed from a hospital and no alarms go off when they're removed from their monitors. I'm looking forward to the sequel for some answers but the script is very lacking in logic. Overall watchable but pedestrian.",2023-09-14
"I swear I wanted to use ""talk to the hand"" as a headline, but it was taken, so...never mind 😊. Anyway...The Buzz about this feature was really intense and the fact it came from A24 only raised the bar a little bit higher.It starts well and seems that the Philippou brothers has found a formula which lead them to a flawless road and after this vague, but intriguing and engaging, introduction we move on to the guessing game of the plot and the main message, which the movie aims to.It talks about a TikTok challenge which involves a mysterious hand, that makes the people holding it get into a weird and trance state of mind. Whether it is true or not and whether it is an imagination of some of the characters of not - not very important to the effectivity of the movie.It holds great. It sometimes chokes the audience like it does to some of its main characters, but it is mainly well written and performed - visually and thematically. But somewhere, near its final section and wrapping scenes it gets lost with his idea and main issues.We see the main character deal with death of loved one and get their condolences and support from friends, but not from their dearest. We see the way the movie deals with its parental figures and issues and off course we get a great scene which relates the ceremony of using the hand and the use of drugs and how much drug using is bad.Like this review, the movie is full with great things but cannot decide what it wants to say in the end of it. It is performed great by a fantastic crew of actors and two brilliant directors, but it probably could have been much better and even legendary.",2023-09-17
"Hi, this was a surprising winner for me especially in the new age of cinema. I didn't actually watch this film but looking forward to watching this week.I doubt it is as gripping and raw as something like Flatliners but it appears they might have stolen ideas directly from that film.As a full on horror it certainly should go dark and deep lets hope it does not let me down. Its so hard to find a great horror.Not a fan of the Nun original or its most recent incarnation. The conjuring also lost its momentum following the second film which just did not hit the mark in the same way the first one did.",2023-09-18
A very well built story with no lapses or overdoing. Even though the events might be familiar to genre lovers writing has managed to manifest a unique story out of traditional scares. Sophie Wilde's performance is excellent in bringing out the most intimate qualities of Mia's character. Good use of visuals and special effects along with effective use of audio effects. Metaphorically the story is telling an equally horrifying tale about addiction loneliness and a fateful breakdown. Though the movie is not giving keeping you at the edge all the time it's got plenty of newness to offer and that makes it surely worth the time.,2023-10-15
"Refreshing movie I watched in theaters and could not take my eyes away. I did not know it was not an American movie until I heard all of the accents but irregardless, the concept is brand new and there is plenty of horrific scenes throughout the movie. The ending was somewhat predictable but essential to complete the movie in its entirety. I would watch it again and definitely recommend anyone else to watch it as well. Great writing, acting, never a dull moment in this film as all you have to do is grab the hand and say talk to me... however, in doing so, you may see something... or someone... you wish you hadn't.",2023-10-02
"This is a massively overrated film.Supposed to be the best horror film of 2023 so I was really excited to watch it when it was released on Netflix. While the premise is quite interesting and unique, the execution of the film was really quite underwhelming. The scene with Riley really is the best thing about the whole movie and after that, it pretty much went downhill. It became less exciting and thrilling rather than having me of the edge of my seat. It's a cross between Flatliners and Ouija but includes a few clichéd tropes we tend to see in most horror films now (death of a parent, etc). So all in all not that impressed with this, could have went in several different directions bit chose this rather boring outcome.",2023-11-01
"I am thoroughly confused as how this movie has a IMDb rating of 7.2. Because, I wish it was possible to give the horrendously stupid movie a Zero, and I am a major fan of horror movies. Yet this is an assortment of ignorant self-absorbed adolescents, none of which are likeable, a couple one might pity. But the main character has no redeeming qualities. The premise should have been a good one, but the direction it was taken in failed to focus on that, script was weak, and not very well acted, it felt to me at least that even the actors were bored, and seemed not only unlike able, but dumb. There are a number of truly gross scenes, so if that blows your skirt up you might like this. Yet, I was looking for genuine horror film, not one that made me vaguely nauseous. To make this movie even more disappointing the ending was predictable, and came off as a beg for a sequel.",2023-10-27
"One of the better horror movies i've seen lately. The story is something new, the actors did a great job, good music and editing. I hope there will be a new horror serie for us after conjuring and insidious is over.The movie didn't just fly by either, it did feel like it did run a bit longer than just 90 minutes and I did appreciate how it held my attention the way it did. I did feel genuine dread from it, that I haven't felt from a horror movie like this in a VERY long time. If not ever. The only problem I had with it is that I wished the story was a bit more revelatory and not so secretive in a lot of areas.Go see it if you're a fan of Horror and Modern Australian Cinema. I hope this brings nothing but success for The Philippou Brothers and the film has already gotten recognition by several popular horror directors including Jordan Peele.This is a must see movie!",2023-08-06
"Went in unsure of what to expect and left feeling totally unsettled, which is exactly what I want from a horror movie. While the premise of possession and seeing/talking to the dead is nothing new, I thought it was a good take on the topic and didn't have to rely on jump scares to put you on edge. The cinematography was great and the gore was impressive (note: this movie is not for the faint of heart). I would definitely recommend to fans of Smile and Hereditary - same vibes and type of scary that keeps you interested the whole time. Overall, a decent horror movie and one of the better ones I've seen this year!",2023-08-02
"I must say, booking to see this with my partner was a gamble. I'm aware of A24 and I find their taste in film differs slightly to mine. I'm not a huge fan of arthouse or 'leave it up to viewer interpretation' type films. I like story-telling, clear direction and a definite ending.The sort of A24 films I refer to when I make this reference is Hereditary, The Witch and The Lobster. Myself and my partner went to see The Witch when away in Liverpool and everyone in that theatre left scratching their heads. What does it all mean?Now its not all bad, Green Room is, in my opinion at least, one of the scariest horrors I've ever seen. It felt close to the bone, personal and plausible.However my biggest fear was a comparison one reviewer made between Talk to Me (2022) and Smile (2022). I thought Smile was hugely overrated, a cheap jump-scare filled mess with a story easy to lose interest in.All this being said, I was expecting some arty type, ambiguous social commentary which would completely miss the mark on the North-West working class English audience in attendance.I was wrong.The first scene set the perfect pitch for the entire film. It perfectly captures the edginess of an overfilled house party, bass filled beats and the utter selfishness of a teenage existence.It was brutal and devastating.One young man in the audience turned to his friend and said, ""what the hell have you brought me to?"" Some people chuckled around me. I could tell some had returned for a second viewing and had a ""just you wait and see"" type sarcasm to their sniggers.It set the bar high and subtly transitioned into character building. Every single one of the characters hit the mark. The young disillusioned teen looking for meaning after the loss of her mother, two insecure young lovers, two young teenage boys jostling for macho one-upmanship and a single mother, barely keeping it all together.Now I cannot spoil it, but I will say that, without a huge budget, this film did not resort to cheap scares. The acting and direction during the 'possession' scenes was more intense than any jump scene in your typical horror trash.The pace its sets is electric as well, I couldn't believe it when we'd got the final third of the film as I was so engrossed. As was everyone else.Now, my only minor gripes were to do with the ending. It doesn't leave it open, but I think they could have tightened it up, made it a bit more obvious to the more casual viewer.The ending in my opinion was solid, perfectly coming full circle and bringing every last word that was uttered into ideal relevance. But I overheard a few conversations leaving the screening where people were clarifying what actually happened, it even made me consider whether I'd correctly consumed the horror of it all.Also, they could of explored the history of the hand object in further depth. They only briefly touch on the backstory, that scene could have been longer.These gripes are nowhere near enough to not make me want to see it again. In fact, I think I will go again, the big screen is the perfect place for this film. Eerie, dark and charging at break-neck speed, with moody teenage Australian rap complementing the underground feel of it all.This film should be enjoyed by all horror fans in my opinion. Now stop deliberating and book your tickets.",2023-08-17
"I read in some places this is of the most appreciated horrorfilms of 2023. So for a person thats into horrorfilms i felt that i had to watch this.A very dark psychological horror/thriller, that fails in originality and production.""Talk to Me"" had a great premise with a really nice trailer. It really got me intrigued.The first minutes, it's already feels really like a B-movie. A pretty confusing start.Its really exaggerated film and not good at all. It gets pretty lame after a while.I don't really understand the high rating on imdb.Manuscript and soundtrack is pretty bad!Pretty bad acting aswell!It gets abit better around the 1hour mark with some scary scenes.I thought it was gonna be alot better really!Good concept and premise, but pretty bad madeHowever a interesting dilemma and a good ending.",2023-11-01

"Talk to me is a horror/Thriller shocking and disturbing movie made from the wonderful directors/YouTube stars the Philippou brothers Danny and Michael Philippou it
follows this group of friends that discover a hand with spirits within side of it they all become hooked on it after they hold the hand and say talk to me the spirits take over them but it like a drug that makes them out of there minds until they need to stop before the spirits actually take over them.This movie has great camera operator work and takes every inch of detail with in the movie so thanks to Jonathan BakerThe movie starts of at this house party with everyone one drunk until this man behind doors comes out and kills himself ooo spooky (Not really).After that tragic event we follow this girl called mia played by Sophie wilde having very struggles after her mother's death and also her girlfriend jade played by Alexandra Jensen.They have kissing sessions and star smoking but after that they keep seeing this hand going viral on the Internet and mia seeing this she like its somewhere were I don't need to think about my mother and jade doesn't want to do it but they do it anyway after she gets there she gets it set up but to get it set up they need the people to help hold her down Hayley is the friend group leader played by Zoe Terakes but after it gets set up mia says Talk to me and now these spirits have taken over her but it's only for like 90 seconds but yeah that's a simple run downAlm I want to say is if you want to see this movie do so but in my opinion the ending didn't make sense until like 3 to 4 hours after the movie.",2023-09-29
"Indy recommended this and we watched it a few nights before Halloween - it turned out we discovered a little gem of a film that was really, surprisingly good.The story chugs along nicely and there's a good amount of suspense and jump-scares to keep you on edge.Really liked the character of Mia. It's a shame she threw herself under the bus by insisting on carrying on the chitchat with 'her mom' (if it was her mom).Speaking of that ... they were playing very fast and loose with the 90 second limit right from the very start - which was a bit disappointing. I mean, get it off Mia at 83 seconds?!? Come on.Some of the scenes were brutal - especially when Riley was kicking off and smashing himself up. Wow. That was offset by some really nice scenes - like when the mum is asking everyone when the party starts. Really good.The elephant in the room is the ending, which is very unclear ... even after a post-viewing internet search.Did Mia kill herself or did Jade push her ... either intentionally or accidentally. Who knows. If she did kill herself ... why? What would that have achieved? This leads me to think that she was pushed ... but I'd love to know for sure.78/100.",2023-10-30
"This movie was INTENSE! 10 out of 10 stars! Super scary, original plot, great writing, great acting! I have NOTHING bad to say about it. The only tiny issue I had, was that I had to add subtitles because their Aussie accents were so thick at times, but who cares?! I haven't seen a horror film like this since Hereditary. I absolutely LOVED it! Highly recommended. I especially loved how they used the 'hand' to get high at first! That was something I don't think I've seen before. I hope to see the main actors in other features because they were absolutely outstanding! I watched it a second time and was just as scared as the first time. What a great horror flick!",2023-09-19
"We've seen horror movies with spirits, we've seen possessions, we've seen the gore and the psychological allegories of grief that ghosts and spirits bring to a movie. Talk to me doesn't really break from the rules of the genre, but modernizes them and works them perfectly.I'm not a fan of jumpscary movies with loud noises and ghosts appearing and reappearing to go ""BOOH!"" in your face. So imagine how grateful I was to see that the scares in this movie are actually mostly well earned and tense and meaningful. This movie is a horror drama, with the horror and the drama blended together in such a way where you don't really know which is the main genre of this story. It scares you (yes it does) but it's also so rich of meaning, of emotions. It uses horror tropes to describe real aspects of depression, and loneliness, and clinging to the past, and wanting an artificial relief from your pain (like drugs, for example, which are very much part of the theme). You wanna look away but you also really care about the characters. The performances were amazing, and I'm not talking about the screaming and the possessions and the body convulsions: there is a lot of details and nuances and little things that help you get into their minds and what they feel and do. The ending is bone-chilling and surprising but also simple and understandable. The only bad parts of the movie were probably the horror cliché soundtrack and some unsatisfying character moments with the boyfriend. But overall very elegant and dynamic and effective and honest, really scary. Recommended for the fans of the genre especially.",2023-10-04
"This is probably the latest scariest horror film I've ever watched since Evil Dead Rise. Although it's not as brutal and nasty as Evil Dead Rise, it still sends chill to my spine. Stories about channeling the dead never ends well. Especially when stupid teenagers are the ones who doing it. They don't know that they shouldn't mess with the spirits. They don't know what those spirits are capable of. I heard that this movie was on a budget. That's impressive! Cause it didn't seem like a low budget horror movie. Props for the director, producers, actors and all of the staff. I see a potential sequel here. Cross your fingers!",2023-10-03
"Honestly, there are a lot of misconceptions going around about this film being compared to other All time great indie horror films such as ""Midsommar"" ""The Witch, and ""Hereditary"". This is not a good example of comparison. You should really not compare any of these, as all A24 horror is spread out differently amongst ridiculously talented filmmakers.What I am here to tell you, is that it's better than all of the above in terms of ACTUAL SCARE factor! THIS IS THE BEST HORROR OF 2023, whilst also being The SCARIEST A24 film to date.""Talk to Me"" is an absolute masterclass in Australian horror filmmaking that surpasses all expectations before it in the genre. This intelligently crafted and superbly paced film is genuinely terrifying, leaving audiences on the edge of their seats. Danny and Michael Philippou, who started as YouTubers and transitioned into horror directors, have delivered a stunning debut that can stand toe-to-toe with even the likes of Hereditary - a testament to their inventive and original approach to the genre.From the very beginning, the storytelling and filmmaking demonstrate an impressive level of skill and creativity, drawing viewers into a world that feels eerily authentic and grounded. The actors' performances are nothing short of exceptional; despite their young age, they bring a level of talent and commitment that adds an unparalleled sense of realism to the film. This authenticity makes even the supernatural elements feel genuinely chilling, akin to iconic and shockingly realistic horror classics like Strangers and Last House on the Left.Sophie Wilde & Joe bird steal the show. Zoe terakes also is quite brilliant! Whilst a ranging support of excellent other young actors do a tremendous amount of work to make the audience feel like they're in the same room as the claustrophobic cast.While some may argue that the ending is anticlimactic or leaves them wanting more, I couldn't disagree more. In fact, the ending is nothing short of perfection, leaving ample room for contemplation and interpretation. It allows the film to linger in the minds of the audience long after the credits roll, sparking discussions and analysis that add even more depth to the overall experience.In conclusion, Talk to Me is an outstanding horror film that excels in every aspect, from its brilliant storytelling and filmmaking to the exceptional performances by its talented cast. It is a must-watch for horror enthusiasts and showcases the Philippou brothers' incredible potential as filmmakers.",2023-09-21
"There were parts of this movie that will forever stick with me. I made sure not to read too much about this because I heard it was a solid original idea and I wanted to see it fresh. At first, I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about it, as I found myself zoning out during the initial lead in.That all changed the moment the first character held the hand. I was immediately pulled into the story and the concept. It had a few scenes that felt a little unnecessary, especially when that scene is presented as giving you an answer just to be told that the answer you were given wasn't true just a few scenes later. If a scene does absolutely nothing to build or progress any aspect of the movie, then it probably isn't needed. But those scenes where very few and far between, and were filmed well enough that it didn't feel like it stopped the flow of the movie.The story and the mythos it built were original and fun. I was fully into every moment the hand came out, and loved the story created by the after-effects of the hand. And the very last scene was just perfect.I did find myself not really caring about any of the characters. It wasn't the actors at all, the actors were all actually really great, but it was just the characters themselves. I believed every moment the actors presented, but at no point did I care if a character lived or died. But that is most likely because everything bad that happened to a character happened because of said character, and they wanted to focus more on the story than try to build up a whole flawed hero narrative that wasn't really necessary. The one attempt at building a flawed hero narrative fell flat for me, so I am kind of glad they didn't spend any more time on it.A very solid 8, and I was really bouncing between an 8 or a 9 until I came to that realization that I didn't care about the fate of the main characters. But still, great horror movie.",2023-10-12
"Not worth watching, the movie has no plot and distracts the viewer from watching the whole movie. I'm not sure who has free time to watch some amateur film. Poor plot, bad acting and zero entertainment value. The acting, or lack thereof was painful to watch. Their characters seemed lifeless, their dialogue fired and devoid of any emotions. What bothered me the most was the complete absence of storyline. The experience was mind numbing that made me question me decision to watch it.I strongly recommend avoiding this movie at all costs. Your time and money would be better spent elsewhere, helping the homeless or feeding stray dogs.",2023-10-17
"I read the reviews to this movie thinking hmm?! Everybody seemed to like this film. I thought it was a combination of creepy, scary, funny and sad all mixed in together. The creepy thing about it is the seances with the dead and the possession of the body. The movie had eerie jump scares and nasty images, especially the one with the kid who smashed his face against the table and walls. That was incredibly disturbing, just the way I like my horrors.The movie alone was absolutely hilarious with the fat dog making out with the boyfriend. That was incredibly obnoxious. The acting of every character including the unknown main character was fantastic. I liked all the characters, even the dead ones. I thought the movie moved along at a moderate pace without any boring scenes. It was sad and depressing for the most part, with the main characters mother parts were quite depressing especially what happened to her.The effects and makeup of the blood and guts were strong. It looked real and the brutality of the dream sequences was weird. The one when the girl licks the boyfriends foot. That was nasty. Overall, it was similar to Midsommar except the ending was not as pleasant for the main character.The movie reminds me of those Ouija Board Djinn summoning movies. The premise is similar to insidious, however, this movie is unique and there are scenes where the characters all get possessed by different spirits which was cool. If you are a fan of horror, this delivers the goods. I cant wait to see what horrors await during halloween. When this is released to DVD, i would definitely purchase it.",2023-08-09
"This movie is more thoughtful than most gory, jump-scare, ""fudge around with a Ouija board and find out"" type movies. If you conjured a demon would it: hide in your house and try to scare you?; make you writhe around on your bed while a priest shouts and throws holy water at it?; or manipulate and warp your perceptions and good intentions until you become an evildoer in your own right?To me the latter is the most frighteningly realistic iteration of how an evil entity might actually behave. After all the devil is most dangerous when he's persuasive and mendacious; not when he's wearing plastic fangs and growling in your attic at 3:00 a.m. This movie taps into that idea without getting too cerebral for its own good.It's certainly not all roses. The acting is hit-or-miss and the story veers into extraneous melodrama at times. But overall it's conceptually interesting and well-executed enough to stand as a cut above most movies with similar premises.",2023-10-18
"It was pretty gruesome at times and I loved how there weren't many boring parts. The whole movie my heart was pumping, wondering what's going to happen next. All the jump scares were so good. I wanted to look away but I couldn't cause it was just too good. I think what made this movie 'scary' is all the jump scares and the gruesomeness. I also like how the scenes weren't just sad, scary gruesome and talking. It also had fun parts. I also loved the connection between the sisters friend and the sisters little brother. When they needed someone they would come to each other. Definitely my favourite horror movie of all time.",2023-08-03
"Happily content playing in the genre pool of conventions and well treaded roadmapping of past possession/body horror, the Philoppou brothers allow themselves freedom to go absolutely wild. Unfolding their story with deliciously depressing themes of trauma and loss that go on inside these character's minds (both literally and figuratively). The result is a superb debut from the two YouTubers (formerly RackaRacka, amazing channel btw) who, as proven by their ridiculously entertaining content, always displayed a clear understanding and love for cinema language.However nothing in that catalogue of goodies suggested such a skill for subtly. Here, they allow the story and character motivations to manifest organically and most crucially, compellingly.And they can thank their lucky stars for snatching up such an amazing first-time leading lady as Sophie Wilde. A difficult role even for a seasoned actor, yet she makes it look effortless.What flaws in the narrative and (classic to horror) stupid decisions from characters that exist, Wilde keeps her central role planted firmly on the edge of foolish and sympathetically desperate. Rarely do horror movie characters make decisions based on actual motivation and it's thanks to the brothers here for laying such a convincing foundation. Keeping an ample grip on some truly vicious material, proving their work deserved bigger than a laptop screen years ago.",2023-08-06
"This movie really doesn't hold back. Within the first 2 minutes the movies tells you how far it's going to go...and it's further than I expected.What follows on a half hour teen dramedy where the teens are making choices that, if they were handled by lesser directors, might seem unbelievable. However, the characters and style really allow you to buy into the events.I love that horrific sensation that you have during the films. When a film like this hits different beats and you just don't know where this is going or what's happening next, you can't shake that horrific feeling.This is such a pleasantly executed horror film. If you like horror films you won't be disappointed.If your unsure whether this film is for you, just watch the first 2 minutes and you'll get your answer.",2023-07-30
"""Talk To Me"" earns a solid 8 out of 10 in my book, not achieving perfection but firmly establishing itself among other fantastic horror films. The Philippou brothers' masterful execution blends tasteful storytelling with sping-tingling suspense, enhanced by the film's impressive cinematography, which captures every chilling moment, in particular the vision of hell were beautiful and horrifying. The exceptional acting further elevates the experience, Sophie Wilde absolutely smashed her role and I am keen to see what she does in the future. As a viewer, I was genuinely captivated by the duo's vision, and I eagerly anticipate their future in the film industry.",2023-10-05
"Easily the best horror movie that has been released over the last few years. It immediately grabs your attention from the get go, right until the credits are shown.Having watched RackaRacka's videos on YouTube as a kid, seeing that they directed a horror movie had me interested instantly and they did not disappoint.From beginning to end, the movie leaves you completely gripped and on the edge of your seat. You become fully immersed in the story being unraveled and all the twists that are thrown in the mix.My only complaint is that the ending felt rushed and a lot of questions are left unanswered. However this may be intentional and leaving room for a second movie to tie up all of those loose ends, which I would be happy to see.I can wholeheartedly say this was the first horror in years that left me with strong uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach.",2023-08-03
"Glad I ignored the negative comments I've seen about.. Having heard lately about a drug that's going about amongst youngsters that can kill them and bring them back seeing something Which is awful I know and something that should never be took it came straight to my mind when watching this and how believable some youngsters would do this and go so far as in this movie as though it's all a buzz & laugh. People do crazy things young.. I think the cast was great, particularly the tomboy girl who owned the hand, although she's not the lead I found ger most watchable. Usually I hate films where everyone's on their cellphones but it gave the right vibe for the generation and how this would play out. I think once things got bad.. The writers kind of didn't know which way to go, as its hard to come up with another new concept this way forward in the possession genre but feel they should've tried harder to find away to push into the boundaries etc and make it about the boy not the girl. The ending for me was cliche and been seen before. But the rest of this film was very entertaining. I just feel they picked what they'd think be the most unique ending out of all done cliches.",2023-08-01
"I usually dislike most horrors, I find that studios and a lot of writers in the genre these days continually recycle ideas and content.Talk to Me was different, I loved everything about it, directing, acting, videography, editing and the entire concept. I noticed some one star reviews, I'd had to invite them to a party, they would be the most boring people at the party, guaranteed they wouldn't do the hand hahaI've followed most Danny & Michael's career and to see them release a incredible movie first go is so great to see.Hoping there is a Talk 2 Me out soon! Great work Danny & Michael & Crew!",2023-08-06
"""Talk To Me"" is an outstanding movie that redefined the horror genre, impressing audiences with its intense and spine-chilling storyline. The film's exceptional execution and eerie atmosphere make it a must-watch for horror enthusiasts. With a perfect blend of scares and thrills, ""Talk To Me"" brings back the essence of classic scary movies, offering an experience that leaves viewers on the edge of their seats. It delivers everything one would expect from a top-notch scary movie, and its exceptional storytelling and haunting scenes make it a standout in the genre. Overall, i recommend it 100/10.",2023-08-06
"I enjoyed watching this horror movie in the cinema. The cinematography, make-up, script, character development, terrifying sequences and acting were top notch. Kudos to the writers, directors and actors for delivering a heartfelt tale which struck a chord.The story was original and instead of jump scares the movie focussed on scaring audience with sorrow and its consequences, and how experiments with the occult can go horribly wrong.A very good Aussie production which kept me watching with interest from beginning to end. The opening credits were shocking and the ending was fitting; a recommended watch for horror genre fans.",2023-07-31
"No need for spoilers. Its a decent horror film, and if you are a fan of the genre than it is worth the watch. The film tries a little hard to be something its not, in its commentary of meth addiction in australia and as a cautionary tale of drug experimentation among the youth. However, the metaphors are a little too forced and obvious, and this eventually comes across as slightly pretentious, and in a small way distracts from the pure enjoyment of an otherwise good horror movie. In my opinion the film could have been excellent if the message were more subtle and less spoon-fed. Otherwise, better just to focus on telling an original story.Acting is very good, however I found the characters all annoying and difficult to relate to.The costumes and make up are excellent, and I love that this film does not rely on special effects.The film is overall entertaining and has some legitimately creepy moments, which i really enjoyed and is why I would recommend the film to a friend.In summary, the bar for good original horror is set pretty low and this film passes easily over it.",2023-10-12
"Talk To Me is the latest in a line of more mature horror released throughout the aughts and still going strong in the modern age. You might have seen the trailers and believed that maybe you were in for the same old story structure that you've seen a million times with movies like this but trust me when I tell you that Talk To Me is a refreshing find that continues the nice trend horror has been sticking to lately. The scares are fierce and earned. They don't come cheap. And you won't soon forget them either, as they are some of the most effective I've seen. To say much else would be a spoiler, but don't skip on this one. One of the best pieces of horror in a long time.",2023-08-04
"Why is there only one rating here? Do you know why? It's because it just gives you a headache and is stressful to watch. Can you believe Mia acting like she's part of the family? She's not the eldest to indulge a 15-year-old kid, and in the end, he commits suicide. I really won't expect much because this is the reality, especially in America, where there are many spoiled brat children who lack attention. This starts from childhood when parents no longer discipline them and don't teach them the right lessons, just educate them. However, this movie is good, but it's just frustrating to watch because of Mia.",2023-09-14
"Never heard of this film till I saw it on social media but what am amazing film, never lost my interest. Great acting, great plot and really clever horror without stupid jump scares. Just finished it and I will happily sit and watch it again with my wife, the build up premise is clever and the story makes great sense and the ending is exactly what I was expecting but I wasn't disappointed, I don't consider this a scary horror film, it's not a slasher but it's definitely a clever horror film about connecting with the underworld. If you see this review do yourself a favour and give it a watch, you won't be disappointed.",2023-09-17
"Concept was nice but couldn't execute it well. At times it was so irritating .I was frustrated for sure ,didn't scare much .teenager horror movie stupid as always.black girls acting was hard to watch at some scenes. This is not a 7.2 rating horror movie, more like 4.Just a stupid movie.There's no amount of technical skill that can make up for sloppy or rushed writing. If these newcomers spent more time analyzing what makes a good story and the craft of characterization, and slightly less time on the technical aspects of filmmaking, they ultimately wind up with better films. I hope they develop their craft further and take such feedback to heart because writing as an art form is being sorely underemphasized in filmmaking, to its great detriment.",2023-09-20
"This will be more of a comment than a review, cause I mostly write under a feeling of justification. And it is that the film, in general, prevails with its positive aspects.On a technical level it is a well-executed production. Even though it is the first step in the seventh art of these brothers (which some will know from their content on YouTube), the result does not suffer from its debutant quality. Audiovisually they manage to match the narrative tone, and the psychological aspect is capable of benefiting from and the budget's features. The story is dark, and it feels dark; It manages to drag you into those moments of tense uncertainty.It is ultimately a horror film that manages to be more than commercial, without impeding its commercial possibility.The only real problem I had with the entire film is that the protagonist, and many others no less relevant to the story, have an excessive capacity to make stupid decisions. And of course this is something that is usually allowed in this genre; we must ignore a certain degree of implausibility in favor of believing what we are told; there is no problem with that. But, with the protagonist, this requirement was somewhat excessive; the character's stupidity made it difficult to try to believe her decisions, making her a bit obnoxious.Apart from this, ""Talk to me"" is a success. I would have given it an 8/10 if Mia had tried to use her brain a few more times.",2023-09-16
"I didn't like the fact that I wasted 1 hour and 30 minutes of my life on watching such a bad movie! This had the oppertunity to be awesome because the story is pretty unique but the whole vibe of it, the acting, the casting was just plain horrible! It's as if it was made by teens for teens or something. Most hollywood movies try so extremely hard to be current (Uber, iPhone, LGBT, typical teen slangs, etc.) and this was no exception. Not scary, Not funny, Not interesting, No sense of real humor. Dry acting, Weird teens doing weird stuff they shouldn't be doing. I didn't get surprised by anything, it was pretty predictable til the end. It really had the potential to be great though.",2023-10-10
"I don't know why the scores are extremely high, this was good, not great. The movie was just ok, nothing horror. I liked the idea of the hand and some twists but that's about all. I enjoyed the movie being done in Australia too which makes it feel just a little creepier than American movies these days. The movie just seemed a bit too predictable and I could see where it was going from the start. I felt slightly insulted by the directors to think that we wouldn't figure the movie out by the first part with the family dynamic. The movie was a bit dull for me, not scary at all. People giving it a high rating is misleading. One or two good parts, the rest was filler drama. Not scary at all, one time watch for me.",2023-10-22
"I thought this was rather well done. Everything looked really good, the suspense was well done. The story was well told. Some characters made some bad decisions. I thought the ending was particularly good.I'm not big on gore, and this film had very little (though there were a couple scenes that I did look away for.)Most of the characters had a good mix of likable and unlikable qualities, most of them seemed realistic, though there were a couple moments here and there where I don't think a real person would talk or act that way.I also thought that the existance of social media and ubiquity of cell phones was used well in this film.",2023-10-05
"Probably the most genuinely horrifying and harrowing cinematic experience i've ever had. I love horror movies, but for 90 agonizing minutes i was anxiously on edge, periodically actively focusing on bringing my heart rate to manageable levels.TTM's haunting, sometimes truly disturbing moments of brutal violence never stoop to nihilism. Familiar genre elements are twisted with a masterfully dark and modern touch. It has a lot to say, its themes spanning trust and communication, social media and high school, addiction and vulnerability, trauma and denial, a refusal sometimes to come to terms with tragedy and the consequences of engaging with a world that provides an easy if temporary escape from dealing with it. The film keeps two fingers on a strong moral pulse beneath its surface thrills, trusting the audience to understand without moralizing or patronizing with over-exposition.The only other times i've felt this way in the theater were during occasional scenes in films like annihilation & hereditary, as well as the opening sequence of midsommar. Talk to Me strikes an deeper visceral chord than any of these very high caliber films, and from its opening cut all the way through the full circle culmination it never once lets up for even a moment. This is a mean, lean ordeal with relentless pacing that never feels rushed.. This is horror filmmaking of the highest order, and not an experience i'll soon forget. Fair warning: It's a heady mix, not your father's horror, not a gateway horror hit: I recommend it to only the most ardent of my horror appreciating friends because although ultimately it's an immensely rewarding journey it is no easy trip.",2023-08-06
"The story is about a bunch of young folks getting together and playing a game. In this game they hold a small creepy sculpture of a hand and say "" talk to me"", what happens when they do that is they see a dead person, then they say ""I let you in""... etc.!They are extremely excited about a crazy experience, but then things go wrong for one of them and it turns into a disaster!The reason I love it is because it's relevant. The hands could be the symbol of recreational drugs, and the rest are the consequences of these activities. In addition, all the events occur in their head! No one else is going through those terrible, scary scenes. Another pertinent point is that when someone is hooked, and ultimately screwed by unhealthy activity, only they suffer and people close to them.All the scenes are shot from the best angles, with wonderful illumination and elegant decor. All actors play great, especially the main actors!Interestingly enough, I gave up horror films because of their empty and unfounded history and so on! But this one looks pretty good. Watch it 😎",2023-08-12
"This movie doesn't muck around, stabbing you in the eyes from the get go, then proceeding to hold a relentless, vice-like grip until the closing scene.Benefiting from unheralded film makers and actors, Talk to Me feels fresh, notwithstanding liberal doses of the tried and true horror touchpoints of gore, gross-out humour, jump scares, creepiness and suspense in varying measures. But this is more than a horror movie, there are layers and depth to themes of peer pressure, addiction, grief, loneliness and spirituality.Fans of the Philippou brothers' Youtube work will leave the cinema ecstatic to see them make a seamless transition to the big screen with a brilliantly conceived and executed movie to match the hype. Those unfamiliar with their RackaRacka channel might be similarly blown away.The atmospheric influence of The Babadook producers Samantha Jennings and Kristina Ceyton is also worth notingOther warranted commendations include the casting (Sophie Wilde outstanding), the at-times vomit inducing sound effects, the authenticity of the dialogue and teen interactions, smart pacing and most importantly the haunting storyline which underpins it all. Not to mention a care factor for the characters absent from too many horror / thriller films these days.An obligatory bigger budget prequel or sequel to Talk to Me has a hard act to follow. Hopefully the Philippous are able to maintain the down-to-Earth elements that made their debut feature so special, demonstrating the unique style and quality of Australian movies.Let it in.",2023-08-22
"This movie falls in the line of most horror movies over the years that share the same plot. But Talk to me took it to another level making it one of the best movies (horror) in a long time, the brother did a great job of horror and writing to this movie over the top.If you looking for a great movie this the one can't wait to see what movie tries to top this.The whole grabbing the hands and saying ""talk to me"" made me want one of those hands just because.The Movie Man suggest this.Great Job can't wait for what the brothers have next up there sleeves, horror done the right way and second to none.",2023-09-21
"I would love to start writing about positives, but I won't:
I start by saying that the critics exaggerate the rating of this film, it is nothing more than a good film, it is not special and its script is cliche, just one of thousands of other horror films. (so much so that I guessed the whole story and its plot-twist in a very short time...)I love being able to say that the entire cast blew me away with outstanding performances and that I'm as proud as it is full of hope to think that some of the names in this film will go on to have hot careers in Hollywood.The direction has great camera games at the time of terror, but in itself, we clearly don't see anything new in it, I would even say that it is very inspired by the style of M. Night Shyamalan...As for violence? Don't worry, few scenes of misfortunes happen on the screen... but the few, sometimes they are too much. I do not recommend to those with a weak stomach.Even though it's not something special, I had fun with this cliché horror and it has good acting, so that's what matters! And I'm excited for news of a prequel or sequel, it seems to be an idea with the possibility of having a great universe to explore.",2023-08-19
"I'm not sure if I was watching the same movie that others describe as great and awesome. The premise is an old one but good one (if done correctly) but this was just lame and I lost interest quickly. There was no build up or anything to the ""scares"" and the scary atmosphere was non existent. It felt cheap and rushed and completely implausible (even for a horror film).I found myself not caring at all what happened to the characters probably due to a lot of over acting and what seemed like forced interactions.I was super excited to watch this movie given all the hype and positive reviews but seriously wasted $7 renting it.",2023-10-21
"Talk to Me in my opinion is nothing short of a masterpiece, without going into spoilers, this movie is not overtly scary I'd say its more disturbing and more of a thriller movie. This movie opens with an amazing one shot take that makes you feel invested in what is transpiring and it not only comes back later and ties into the film, but it also sets the tone for whats to come. From great cinematography to phenomenal acting and a great sound track as well as sound design, and a really original take on possession, Talk to Me gives you everything you could want from a horror movie. All in all Talk to Me is a must watch if you are a horror fan and is amazing, and to add a little bit more, the montage scene as well as the opening scene are my two favorite scenes of the movie. (IMHO)",2023-10-31
"What if ghosts were cool again? How's it possible to achieve such task? It's by giving Gen Z a prominent voice and making them heard.The movie feels passionate and alive with its witty dialogue and relatable characters. It doesn't try to relate to the younger generation, it just does. It's fast paced, re-contextualises the form of communication with the other entities and makes sure that it feels fresh.I like, that the main character is somewhat unlikable. She's relatable and you can understand her motivation behind her actions, but that doesn't take away that she's a egoistic and narrow minded person. Although some characters feel a bit too cartoonish, it adds to the youthful feeling of the film.I'm excited what RackaRacka comes up with in part 2. Part one sure does leave enough room for interpretation and theories. For me, it doesn't have to get any deeper than that. I hope, that they'll stay true to the ambiguous feeling of the original and don't try to go big with the next one.",2023-08-09
"A24 is like my favourite studio.. talk to me is a horror film directed by rackaracka (the YouTubers) this movie shows everything that a horror movie should show and more.. it shows fear, gore, disturbing moments with a good story and soo good acting the whole cast acting is a 9.5 out of 10 except on Sophie Wilde her acting is 100% the best out of the whole cast and it's a 10 out of 10.. this horror movie isn't predictable like most horror movies are.. it has good length of 1 hr and 35 min, good storyline, good backstory behind the hand that they use for conjuring spirits and the reasoning for them doing it.. is cuz they saw it viral on the internet of people doing it, and the main character agreed to doing it cuz she wanted to talk to her dead mum, the hand has a story/backstory to it that it belongs to a psychic and that you can talk to the dead then they started making theories that there's an actual hand inside it Etc.. also mums or family mostly dies cuz they're in a car accident in most movies/horror movie but in this the main's characters mum died cuz she took too many sleeping pills.",2023-08-06
"Okay, finally a horror movie dirrerent than the basic and boring horrors we get now.When your first ever full lenght movie is this successful..you know you are a talanted human being, the brothers did so good job, i enjoyed not watching the same ploted horror. I liked it. All of the cast did fantastic job. The plot is genius and cool. I will rewatch it for sure, this is rewatchable. I'm definitely looking forward to a sequel. Not perfect but definitely better than most horror movies nowadays. The movie didn't have as many jump scares, but the script storyline and overall weirdness of the film makes up for the lack jump scares.",2023-09-13
"Believe the hype! A lukewarm start, caught cold, warm around the horror heart.The genre remains true to itself, but on top of a lot of masses, there are also some great ones every now and then, when you don't even expect them. There are certainly no completely new ideas, where should they come from, but at least a contemporary mixture of existing components with their own interpretation. In addition, there are many aha-moments, not only jump-scares, but scenes that go to the viewer's substance. The actors are not glossy but authentic, the effects are beyond reproach and even look handmade.All in all, definitely in the running for horror film of the year.",2023-10-06
"I expected this movie to come out, as the rating is high for a horror film. Well, in this case, it is incredibly disappointing since it is not a horror movie in its essence. It is some attempt to make a social commentary (which failed as well). Instead, we have a bunch of unprecedentedly annoying teens with all of their superficial views, identity crises, lack of empathy, and no communication skills. This is basically what this film was about: teens doing stupid stuff and hurting each other. It is impossible to view the film if you hate the main character. I scrolled through the last part of the film because everyone was annoying. Five stars are for the cinematography and for a new idea.",2023-09-17
"In Talk to Me, I praised the story and the theme it deals with (do not mess with the supernatural and the ghosts dimensions), performances of the cast, violence and brutality, direction, screenplay, cinematography, and ending, which has a new idea that is not present in many movies these days.But regarding the flaws, Talk to Me has a number of flaws that cannot be ignored, at least from my point of view. First, I felt that the movie didn't take full advantage of it's premise. Second, it is true that the movie has horror scenes, violence, and brutality, but at the same time, and from my point of view also, it could have more because I felt that the horror parts were not so scary enough and satisfying.When it comes to the score, I give Talk to Me 7 out of 10.",2023-08-01
"I myself is a massive fan of horror films and I watched this and have to say that it's a great horror, in regards to contribution to the horror genre.The writers have out done themselves as the story is cleverly written! Acting is brilliantly acted. I don't have anything negative relating to this.I watched the first minute or so and the storyline immediately sucked me in wanting me to watch more, initially wanting to see what happens next. And the ending, not spoiling it but such a intelligently done. Very impressed. It's been a while since I've seen a decent horror film.Overall this is well worth a a watch. 👍🏻",2023-09-18
"I have been an avid watcher of horror films, from good to bad. It seems filmmakers have been running out of material for the last few years now, producing sequels or simply regurgitating the same old themes. Lately I've been watching movies without reading descriptions or watching trailers. I've been craving something new, something surprising. Sometimes not watching the trailer is the only way to do that. In this case, I was pleasantly surprised to finally watch a horror film that has been needed for years. Talk to Me is REFRESHING! To say the least. I went in blind and found myself jumping, gripping the hand rests or literally sitting on the edge of my chair. Talking to the dead is nothing new, of course, but this was a new take on it and it was exceptionally done. Don't believe me? Go check it out!",2023-08-01
"I've created an IMDB account JUST to review this movie. I like to think I'm not overly affected by horror movies, but this one has me covering my eyes and crying at certain aspects.The actors? Incredible. Every single one of them. I was so blown away by Sophie, her skills are jaw-dropping. The directing and the producing are top notch, perfect music, perfect length, I was on the edge of my seat the entire time and could not take my eyes off the screen.The fact that something this amazing came out of my home town is so inspiring. Im blown away and will not be able to sleep for a week. Go South Australia!",2023-08-08

Decent acting, good camera footage, decent writing and no major names/faces in it but it held up on itz own though."" most"" scenes were unpredictable which made it deemed worthy!! No sex scenes or virgin type horror sacrifices/urban legend plots as most newer generationz for some reason keep mimcin of one anotha.

"Time to hear an intelligent honest and constructive critical review.If this is a supernatural horror - it does very little to scare apart from the tacky JUMP SCARES which are known to be the cheapest form of scares in storytelling.Let start from the beginning, the first act's pacing is boring. We are introduced to a bunch of mainly white whiny and uninteresting teens and 1 diverse character of color who has a British accent.It is so unclear how the dark girl is connected to the white family until more than half the film - that she's a step sibling. Biggest mistake of storytelling is having the audience try and guess who someone is - if it's not part of the twist. So here I am trying to guess who she is the whole time, which takes me out of the story - big mistake directors.You never see the father and the mother together and its never explained, big plot hole.It takes roughly 20 min or more to even know what the film is about. I'm all for character development and setting up the story but the pacing of the first 20 min was boring. You have to put up with typical Aussie style party and then cringeworthy teens teasing and laughing at each other. And of course, your token Diverse casting choice who can't act and throw in a transgender who mocks everyone and even mocks Jesus Christ - which is unnecessary, no religion should be mocked.When you find out about the hand - that's when the film gets interesting and it's a GREAT CONCEPT, shame the rest of the film was NOT executed right.Once it gets started the film is good and engaging but NOT really scary, like it's on the low end of scaring anyone, a lot of stuff is done with a ALOT of light not in the dark and sometimes during daylight - which is NOT scary - who's afraid of daytime?The middle of the film is really good, but the characters are NOT that interesting, and the actors are not the very best to be cast in this film apart from Miranda Otto who is wasted here.Overall, the film is shot well, and it looks like a Hollywood film, but the film just doesn't deliver anything different.It's just another - conjure up spirits movie using a HAND and not a Ouija board - the rest is a typical formula.Between 45 min and the end the film loses steam and doesn't really climax, until the very last scene, which feels like no real build up.The last scene which ties into a sequel is very cool and clever.It's a fun movie, easy to watch but not scary and could have been so much better.Goes to show that YouTube stars are NOT real story-tellers or directors.You just need to be popular on YouTube and Screen Australia and Screen Adelaide will throw money at you.",2023-09-17
"It begins maybe too slowly for today's fast paced quick fix crowd (the film pokes fun at the phone obsessed younger people this movie is clearly aimed at!) but this slowness adds depth and character to Mia, Jade and young Riley that most horrors fail to address-make the characters believable and maybe sympathetic. Would Halloween still have resonance since 1978 if Laurie Strode wasn't as kindly or humane as she was?I genuinely felt for these young characters and the ' curse' that has befallen them.The story itself is a mash up of M. R James inspired stories notably (though better, It Follows, though Nigel would disagree!) which added more atmosphere and tension , the scares and ' jump scares' aren't as effective as the filmmakers intend which seem signposted in advanced and for a regular horror fan I could see them coming.Nonetheless, its one of the better horrors I've seen lately , thanks to a well crafted script, a sound if unoriginal idea and refreshing to see it set in Australia, with the aforementioned It Follows type set design of working class neighborhood, adolescence sweat and a foreboding sense of dread lurking underneath these interior/exteriors.",2023-09-16
"This is definitely the best horror movie I've seen this year. I went in expecting nothing thinking it would be a Truth or Dare type of hollow experience. I was pleasantly surprised based on no knowledge of this movie.However, it was very derivative of other movies such as Hereditary, Smile, Society (1989), The Skeleton Key (the ending twist...), The Ring, various episodes of Are You Afraid of the Dark (Quicksilver, Magicians Assistant, Super Specs) and even Goosebumps (Let's Get Invisible...).So don't go in expecting something you haven't seen before, as all the aforementioned have bits and pieces in this movie. Intentionally, or not intentionally, this is not a new concept. The whole drug allegory/glorified drug use on social media is very obvious too. The satire is well done with one hilarious montage.What is good is the direction, the acting, and the plot. There are genuinely disturbing moments. There is a sense of dread and desperation in these characters (similar to Hereditary) that is gripping.The very ending is chilling and left me feeling sad how it all played out.I fear this movie may get overhyped since the bar is so low with recent horror movies. It is not a scary movie by any means. Also it seems like every recent horror movie is obsessed with characters having ""trauma.""Anyway, it is worth a watch. 7.5/10.",2023-07-30
"WOW WOW WOW.This one completely blow me out of the park, down the street and into next year. I would describe this as a cross between elevated horror/jumpscare horror.First a want to talk about the movie then about the background surrounding the film.Has a good run time of 95 mins and great pacing, this film flys by. The title card/first jumpscare - absolutely chilling, the first 'jumpscare' in this film is brilliant. I wasn't expecting it and sent my body into a temporary hot flush.Sophia Wilde is something else. I haven't seen this level of acting in awhile and she hits every note with ease. Can't wait to see where her acting career takes her. Two other notable characters were Joe Bird and Chris Alosio, the energy they gave off was spot on.I love how the directors decided to lean more towards practical than CGI because it shines in this one. The Kangaroo was mostly animatronic which made it feel more grounded in reality. Plus the symbolism was very well done!I wish we got to see some more spirits or the world they live in as I thought it was very cool but left wanting more.I still have some unanswered questions about the film but knowing they are making a sequel doesn't necessarily give me any relief. I wish they either left the film as it or decided to make a new movie.",2023-08-16
"This ""talk to me"" is an Australian horror/thriller film that surprised me positively.It features very original and creative elements within the genre, the atmosphere of the film is almost always quite bizarre and strange throughout it.The central character is Mia, played by Sophie Wilde with great competence, in a very demanding and ambiguous role.The entire first part of the film, where several spiritualism sessions take place, will trigger unexpected developments in Mia, who finds herself confronted with her past, specifically with the death of her mother, 2 years before, in circumstances that Mia has not yet managed to overcome, accept and understand and that torment her.Faced with a rather absent father, she finds her ""improvised"" family in her friends Riley (Joe Bird) and Jade (Alexandra Jensen).The film is always quite tense, with practically no sequences that ""clear"" the dense atmosphere.There are two ""spiritualism"" sequences with Riley that are quite violent.In short, a film that develops differently from most films of the genre, and this option by the directors (Danny and Michael Philippou) proves to be positive and almost always effective.One of the most successful films in the genre in recent years.7.5/10.",2023-08-13
"At first the movie was so board, starting was good but after that the story is getting weak, I thought it. It's a horror movie but everyone plays games with the wired hand & they enjoy that link they took that normal!!! But the next time the kid who want to play that game. The ghost catches the kid, Mia's mother gets into the kid. Then the kid reacts like the ghost want to kill him. It was a good story, but..When Mia invite Denile in his house, at night Mia start sucking Denile's fingers!!! What kind of wired story of this movie!!! The last scene was also lame, Mia wants to kill that kid, after that Mia jump on the road & got accident!!This the worst movie I've ever seen.",2023-09-30
"The concept and logic of the movie is just a tweeked version of cliche Mediumship , however the execution and presentation i would say pretty neat. The girl who played the main character 'Mia' seems to put her skills at best trying to fit perfectly into the character, she does a good job except for some parts. The only cringe i felt about this movie was near to the end when they show the disgusting same old cliche looking elderly person as a ""spirit"" who didn't pass through to the other side. That totally fits to the theme here but we have seen that crap way too many times to be scary. Also this type of horror ain't giving any scary vibes anymore.The rest of the cast and crew have done a nice job overall. It's only worth a one time watch for a horror movie!!",2023-09-12
"When it seems like somethings real, it's not. When it seems like someone is good, they're evil.This movie keeps you guessing in classic a24 style. It's more coherent than a lot of prior a24 movies in that the plot makes sense and there's not much artsy confusion, but that does not stop it from being just as engaging. The main character is very interesting, seemingly disengaged at first, but her plot line is much a mystery as any other character in the film. The foreshadowing of the ending is not overdone. The film guides you to its conclusion in a way that allows you to reach it without treating you like you're stupid. Excellent watch and definitely one of the best of 2023.",2023-09-04
"How the hell did this get a 7.2 rating....this is a below average horror at the best of times. I had high hopes for this movie but yet again let down. I'm a lover of horror films, I see high ratings from a lot but surely these people are just sheep, following the majority. These people cannot be serious, comments such as 'well written', It's not a clever concept, or well executed.....plus the acting is awful. Please watch and please critique if you feel the need. I certainly needed to comment on this as it's been highly overrated. 7.2 is honestly laughable and I'm dreading what these individuals really class as a decent horror movie. A few parts of this movie were OK, buts that's not anyway near makes up for the rating it got.",2023-10-27
"First of all the acting, cinematography, costume and production was all fantastic. This film was clearly enabled to be the best it could, and it turned out very well indeed.Obviously, during the first half you always have that fear of not knowing what to exactly expect, and then its usually followed by a buildup of lore and understanding as to why evil spirits are wreaking havoc for the characters, and that fear kinda goes away. Too many horror films expose their antagonist's true nature in a way that has me lose all fear and respect for the composition of evil characters and beings.Talk To Me deals with this kind of storytelling in a way that is gradual and preserving of the credibility of the bad guys. This film has excellent pacing and delivery so I ended up understanding the lore while still being freaked out and appreciating all the creepiness and nastiness.Furthermore, this film uses elements like humour, chaos, hysteria, montage and much more in a new and frankly iconic way that truly makes me want to relive the whole theatre experience again.Yes, you read that right. Same horror film, dark and loud theatre, all over again. Yes please!",2023-08-16
"One of the best horror/ gore movies I've ever watched, the scenes were just so raw and showed less concern for the faint hearted, that in my opinion makes a great movie. Amazing concept, the humor/comedy almost is impossible to miss with impeccable timing. They done a really good job with this movie, its one of them movies you don't really expect much from but you're hit with something perfectly planned and executed. I can't lie, they lost me by making it look like they're just stretching the movie but i was very wrong, one of the best endings to a horror movie in awhile. Definitely a new favorite.",2023-08-01
"Wicked amazing movie, well worth the watch.I loved it, I wonder how many others they have made like this.You should definitely book your ticket and see this movie. Great actors, was scary and not your typical horror movie where you predict the ending, the ending was unexpected, I rate this very good and I hope they create more movies like this.I would watch this again and I hope there is part two or three, maybe more who knows. The setting was good nothing got boring for me, I was hooked from start till the finish, money well spent at the cinemas.Thank you for creating a good movie xx.",2023-08-02
"I love horror, it's my favorite genre. I've seen 200+ horror movies, this is easily in the top three worst ones I've ever seen. All of my friends who have gone to see it feel the same way, so I'm honestly quite surprised at the number of good reviews. The concept was really cool to me and I was actually very excited to see where they went with it. The clips they use in the trailer are the only good clips in the movie. Nothing in this movie is scary. I wasn't scared or anxious even one time throughout the film. The pacing is horrible. It's extremely slow and it takes an hour for literally anything to happen. The characters are not well-rounded, so you don't end up caring about them enough to care if they survive or not. The actors are supposed to be in high school but most of them look like they are in their 40s, so it's not believable at all. It would have made A LOT more sense if this took place at a college/university. The plot is extremely under-developed and most plot points are never explained or thought out in a way that made them feel important or interesting. I found myself getting SO bored. The ""twist"" is also highly predictable, which to be fair happens quite often in horror, but maybe the ending would have been able to take this from a 1-star to a 3-star if I hadn't seen it coming from a million miles away. I would recommend that you skip this movie. If you're curious about it, wait til it becomes available to stream for cheap instead of wasting your money at the cinema. Super disappointing snooze-fest.",2023-09-17
"I was very impressed with how amazing this turned out. Yet I only went cause I had time between jobs. Was not disappointed at all. The story is very gripping.. I thought it was going to be predictable but nope. I was very surprised and impressed. I so can't wait to buy this so I can watch it again.The acting was phenomenal and the story telling had me hooked.Didn't have many jump scenes but plenty of scenes that would make you cringe. Miranda Otto was phenomenal in this. All of the new faces in this were just as good as well. Again, it gripped my attention very well. I do highly recommend this one to watch. Even if it is just one time.",2023-07-30
"This movie blew my expectations away. I'm not much of a horror fan but the psychological aspect of this a great. The concept is new and refreshing. I want to see more adaptations of this, definitely leads you to wanting more in a good way.There is so much content that can be expanded on before and after the timeline of this movie.I'll be thinking about this movie for days. There's no moment in the movie that I thought to myself ""nobody would do that"" meaning all the interactions seemed pretty believable. I recommend watching this to anyone. I looking forward to more from this and hopefully it becomes like a series or something.",2023-08-13
"Danny and Michael Philippou's intense and intriguing horror film that truly delivers a good scary time. About a bunch of foolhardy sarcastic teenagers who play a game with a mysterious embalmed severed hand, by holding it and saying to it 'Talk to Me' which allows the player to be temporary possessed by it's malevolent sprit that gives them the ability to see and chat with the dead for 80 seconds, any time longer than that is dangerous. The reckless teens of course go over the safe time limit and now must face the deadly consequences. A unique horror show with solid direction by the Philippou brothers, and excellent performances by Sophie Wide, Ari McCarthy, Hamish Phillips, Kit-Erhart-Bruce, Jayden Davison, Sunny Johnson, Marcus Johnson, and Joe Bird. A must-see motion picture for horror fans.",2023-09-26
"I watch this movie because I read the good reviews.Me and my daughter, fans of the horror, were excited to see the ""best horror movie so far"" and etc
This is by far the worst horror movie i've seen in a while. Bad acting, boring as f. Very predictable and confusing at the same time. Even my teenage daughter got disappointed as we watched together. Pure waste of time.It starts wrong, it gets better after some patience watch, then you drool waiting for the good stuff, then you get disappointed, after you get a good scene and then you just wish you're dead.It is a promissing story, just needed a good director.",2023-09-15
"One of a top horror movie in this year, theatre experience, sound effects, the sounds and scenes are so horrific in this film. Watch this on theatres better in small room on the 3rd row, they make a good experience in sounding,one of an horrifying theme in this film they added. If anyone not interested in horror films try this one💀 i will give the rating as 10. Nobody knows about this movie if watch this one you will thrilled. I was thinks it was just a normal horror movie but they changed the movie scenes to great themes and sounds, theatre level experience one of the best experiences in this scenes and sounds you heard. Try this one.",2023-08-19
"The movie 'Talk to Me' is really dumb and annoying. It's about a group of high school kids who do weird stuff like using a dead hand to talk to spirits while also getting high on drugs. Who in their right mind would play with a dead hand like it's a video game? The whole idea is unsettling and just plain foolish.The two main characters, Hayley and Joss, are the main troublemakers in the story. Even after they know that using the hand drove someone crazy and made them commit suicide, they still let their friends mess around with it. And what's worse, they don't face any consequences for their actions, which makes the audience uncomfortable.One of the most annoying parts is when they have a party at Jade's house, and everyone acts like the dead hand is some kind of magical thing, even letting a kid play with it. Who in their right mind would willingly let the dead take over their bodies? It's a strange concept, even for irresponsible teenagers. Mia is a total mess, too. She's already messed up in the head, and on top of that, she wants to contact her dead mother without thinking about the consequences. Instead of focusing on the dead, they should have shown her struggling with her mental health, which would have been a much better story.Every character in the movie seems crazy and irresponsible. You won't even care if something bad happens to them because they're all so annoying. None of the characters show any growth, they just keep being irritating.As for the plot, it's just plain stupid. Nothing is explained properly, like where the hand came from or why it's important. Most of the movie is wasted on the antics of obnoxious teenagers, and it ends with a pointless drama. We don't even know what happened to one of the characters, Riley, and they don't bother explaining it.In short, 'Talk to Me' is not worth your time. It's shallow, the characters don't make sense, and the story is a mess. You're better off skipping this one.",2023-09-17
"Why are people rating this so high? I don't get it. Its not original, the acting is not great and there are so many plot holes.It's bang average at best. I'm going to put this down to people around 16-18 not knowing what a good horror film is.I need to hit 600 words so I will use this to say that you need to choose better horror. The legacy horror is really not that bad. The Hellraiser franchise is golden for pure gore and shock. The decent is one of the best horror movies ever, avoid number 2.I am now at the end, do good and be good. Enjoy your movies and don't take them literally. Have a great Halloween.",2023-10-28
"The final 30-odd minutes where the concept just descended into.. well, let's be honest, nonsense.I would consider myself a horror movie fanatic, so I'm always looking for the next great thing. That said, I'm also fairly hard to please. I know what I like and when it hits the spot I like that feeling fear, suspsense, mystery and satisfaction that only a genuinely good, wholly unique horror movie can bring.Up until around the 50-60 minutes mark, Talk to Me felt like it was hitting that spot. I was enthralled, intrigued, the cast where doing a fantastic job and the concept was an interesting take on the 'haunted object' idea.But the final half hour just kind of leapt off a cliff and turned a bit daft. I won't go into details, so I avoid any big spoilers but while the actions of certain characters can be explained away with 'they were possessed' there were too many inconsistencies and.. well, basically 'plot holes' for that to be valid.One big issue I did have besides that though, is why the entire room of people just sat and watched as the kid brother repeatedly smashed his face into a table, a floor and then a worktop, when any one of them could've at least held him down to stop the possessing thing from doing that to him. Likewise, his sister just sits screaming and crying while hes' bashing his head into the wall at the hospital. None of these scenes made any sense and kind of take another point off. The movie could've successfully reached the same ending without these two scenes which made little sense.Also, the young kid's sister, Jade, has to be one of the most useless, obnoxious characters I've ever seen in a horror movie.",2023-09-18
"""Talk to Me"" breathes new life into horror, spinning a captivating tale about friends stumbling upon an eerie ritual involving a ceramic hand that connects them to the spirit realm. From its gripping start to its satisfying conclusion, the film boasts originality.Balancing jump scares and memorable moments, it keeps you hooked. Graphic scenes are strategically used to amplify the story's impact, generating lingering unease. Despite a few clichés, the characters feel real, grounding the supernatural horror. Stylish direction and sound add tension, though it's more eerie than terrifying.While some concepts could've gone further, the film's strengths outweigh minor shortcomings. In a genre often disappointing, ""Talk to Me"" shines as an innovative gem, blending an original idea, relatable characters, and effective storytelling.It's not for everyone, but its unique take on the supernatural and chilling atmosphere offer a compelling cinematic experience.",2023-08-10
"I was very surprised by how good this movie was. It wasn't predictable, it didn't have typical jump scares, and it didn't follow the basic horror movie plot line like most movies do these days. While it was a tad bit confusing story-wise, the acting was great! Mia did an amazing job! Australia has got some talent! So glad they were able to bring this film to the US and showcase their hard work. I watch a lot of Horror /Triller movies and rarely do things take my breath away, but my goodness there were scenes that made ME, ME!!!! Cover my eyes! And I never do that! So a round of applause for this cast and crew!",2023-10-04
"""Talk to Me"" didn't impress me much. It's a decent movie, but I don't feel satisfied after going in with the expectations that all the positive reviews gave me. At least it was engaging.The plot is fairly intriguing; it puts a unique spin on a familiar concept in the horror genre. The ending is quite clever as well. The acting is pretty solid all round. The lead actress does a splendid job here; I'm glad to see her getting more roles. The cinematography is also quite impressive. There are a couple of graphic, gory sequences that really enhance the experience. The tension is *there* in this movie. On the surface, ""Talk to Me"" has a lot working in its favour.However, I wasn't on board with some of the writing decisions taken. We're given characters who aren't so easy to root for. They might be teenagers, who naturally tend to be messy, but it's kind of dissatisfying watching them make certain decisions and being forced to deal with the consequences. While the ensuing events could be entertaining, it could equally get tiring. Fortunately, you can recognize some instances where the situation is out of the character's control. You're able to sympathize with them in those few moments. The movie is not a largely irritating endeavour - not at all - but I was missing that sense of chaos unfolding naturally. It's just more rewarding for me.I'm not entirely convinced that this is the refreshing take on horror that everyone claims it is, but it is a solid movie. Don't hesitate to check it out if you're looking for an entertaining creepy flick.",2023-09-22

I rented it at home because I had the flu when it was in theaters, but I couldn't wait to see it. I was so happy to be surprised by how original and engaging this horror film was! I couldn't stop thinking about this film for days! It was so smart and original (to me anyway). Great acting, especially from the lead actress who you really do care about.

Super proud and surprised to see it was an Australian film too, so went out of my way to look up the writer, producer and cast.

Yet, after a mere 17 minutes into the film we were already bored and distracted. I tried unsuccessful to get a refund from the streaming platform because the film was JUST THAT TERRIBLE and unwatchable, really.. We are in our forties, and this unsophisticated heap of nonsense seems more appropriate for teenagers - an embalmed hand? Really? It wasn't frightening, gripping, or thrilling, but rather poorly executed with a dismal plot. Don't waste your time and money.",2023-09-18
"It is really hard to rate this film because it is definetly above average when it comes to horror films, the acting is good but characters are mostly unlikeable so viewer doesn't feel connected to them which would be good in order to immerse themselves in to the story. It just feels like missed opportunity. Some aspects of the story could have been explored more. We didn't learn much about the spirits from the other side. Reading my own review, it doesn't film like a 8 stars movie but obviously I just feel sorry that this wasn't better although it was very good and tense. Horror movie loves will love it.",2023-09-14
"Talk to Me is genuinely a scary film but is weighed down by weak characters and a thin script. That's not to say it isn't enjoyable; quite the contrary. There are numerous images that won't be quick to leave my mind - Riley's turn holding the hand, the dog scene (you know the one), and truly one of the most terrifying images I've ever seen in a horror movie: Mia seeing a vision of Riley being tortured in the spirit world. The directors also excel in depicting the dichotomy between what is happening in Mia's head and in reality - most notably the scene in which she kills her dad. It's psychological horror at its best. I also liked the idea of holding the hand being akin to drug use and its associated effects.But my complaint about the film is that it's too straight-faced at times, which shouldn't be the case in a teen horror. The characters are too dull and generic to be believable teenagers, aside from Mia and Riley, somewhat.Overall, Talk to Me prioritizes scares over any overarching message, and that's a good thing. The ending was very pleasing, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching Talk to Me in theaters on the big screen, which really heightened the film's amazing sound.",2023-09-08
"It has been a long time since a really great, cerebral and truly scary horror film has been made. This one is well worth the wait. The storyline has never been done before, it's so creative and laid out seamlessly, and quickly. No overblown, detailed backgrounds on each character - the object that brings terror into the lives of these kids is shrouded in mystery, which makes it terrifying. The movie is centered a group of teenagers who discover a mysterious object that allows them to communicate with the dead, and the plot is C's tested around the teens and their interaction with evil. This keeps the movie flowing, and makes it flow easy, the movie doesn't get bogged down in ridiculous background stories, unnecessary characters and silly CGI. It's just enough to scare the living pants off of you. The acting is fantastic - and shocking. Overall, this is a GREAT kickoff to the Season Of The Witch! A must see.",2023-10-01
This movie is everything you wouldn't imagine because what was this? I found solace in finding who to blame for the aftermath of the decisions made by these teens. Conjuring spirits and expecting nothing???? This was crazy I'm typing this as I'm trying not to look at the gore on screen. It was extreme in many ways but yea I'm spooked. This feeds my kids and teens who really will find a way to ruin families with the supernatural like conjuring spirits or reading satanic books like the last evil dead. This movie shows what hopelessness will get you and what not watching the company your kids keep will get you .,2023-08-05
"I went in to this movie expecting a typical a24 movie. I was right and wrong. I don't think there is such thing as a typical a24 movie anymore if there ever was. If you have a chance, look in to the brothers who made this movie. Their story is incredible and makes me love this movie even more.Throughout the movie I kept finding myself getting more and more frustrated with the main characters choices. All the consequences were falling on innocent people. But that's how life is and in the end, she got what she deserved.The use of practical effects was incredible. Usually I don't like gross out horror movies but this one used realistic effects and none of it was gratuitous. Not for the faint of heart when it comes to gore but it wasn't the worse I've seen either. On par with Hereditary and The Witch.All in all, I was not disappointed. I needed some time to digest a few things because the movie does not spell out anything for you and I feel as though some things were left ambiguous on purpose. I'll be interested to see peoples theories on the ending. My personal theory is that she was shown a false vision from her ""mother"" of Riley suffering.",2023-07-31
"This film made a good impression. It's a dull experience when you find yourself yet again in the theatre watching another iteration of the same formula. We get that a lot in terms of horror movies. However that's not the case of ""Talk to Me"".When entering the theatre in the horror genre we're in for a treat of jump scares and high pitched piano scores. Nevertheless what we got here is not one of those repetitive iterations.""Talk to Me"" decides to be the deepest movie of its kind I have seen in a long time. It reaches for our hearts in an era of soft stories. We are getting accustomed lately to a cold treatment of trauma. To only pass by the sentiments of loss and anger because what we are in for are the jump scares and the gore.Not saying that latter is a wrong approach because when a film do that brilliantly it does not make sense to linger in other deeper things, but it is precisely what this film do so good. It's not afraid to pause and look into the eye of despair, loneliness and cruelty like few others.Many may leave the cinema not getting what they were looking for but pleased either way.",2023-08-21
"""Talk to me"" is brutal. And the funny thing is: this a film made by youngster TO youngsters and it's pretty damn good.The atmosphere is dense and the comic relief is well used, not affecting the dark tone of the entire flick. Since the begging the direction tells something to the audience, and this is: NO ONE IS SAFE. NOT EVEN KIDS.Talking about kids: the scene were the spirits attacks Riley (from within) at the hospital, making he hit his head against the wall while in the floor is violent and creepy as f_ck. The direction of the twins is GREAT, using creative angles all the time.Good actings and a desolating and sad ending make this a MUST watch fot every horror fan.I TRULY hope that the sequel and the prequel can have the same heart and passion as the original.Fingers crossed!",2023-08-24

I couldn't predict the ending.The beginning was a little slow but they are introducing the characters. It's a foreign movie And accents always make me listen hard, but this one was not bad. The acting was good. And I did get creeped out which doesn't really happen to me. There could be another movie like this, but I've never seen one. If it happens to affect you then I call that a good movie. It's not winning awards but it kept me in suspense and I had no idea of the ending. Watch it and don't turn it off.

"Horror films these days are dismal, cliched and all seem to use the same repetitive tropes. However, there is something original and intriguing about TTM that captivates the watcher. The hand itself makes you wonder about its origin story and certainly makes you feel uneasy when looking at it. The acting and story development is spot on and it had me fully gripped. There are some great gory moments if you're into that, but the suspense and terror is cleverly executed by playing on the things you don't see. TTM is a great addition to the genre, and refreshing - something you can't say about the churn of tripe hollywood is happy to plate us. The Aussies have nailed it! The idea has huge potential and I hope they build on this for what I hope will be many sequels.",2023-07-29

"A perfect demonstration of how a bunch of teenagers would deal with a paranormal situation when they're in way over their heads. The story does follow a tried and true plotline of a cautionary tale or a visual adaptation of a parable, but at the same time, it does so in a way that isn't so obvious or boring. The characters in this story are arguably caricatures of their real-life counterparts, but the consistency in their behavior and solid acting from the cast helps progress the plot rather than muddling it down with unnecessary twists or unnatural dialogue.I would also understand those who would call this tactic formulaic, and I would agree with that, but I have to add that it has enhanced it with suspenseful pacing and graphic depictions of evil. What makes the movie truly scary is the fact that this could happen in our current time, even with all of our advancements in technology, to someone we know, and maybe someone we love. If you want an interpretation of possessions and demons that is more or less faithful to historical illustrations, then you will be pleasantly surprised by how seamlessly they fit into our modern society.",2023-08-10
"I liked this movie, It reminded me of the 80s classic ""Witch board"" movies but using a hand instead of a board. It is one of the better horror movies of today, that's for sure. Good acting, good story and worth watching. The ending was a bit predictable but there could and should be a part 2. There needs to be more modern day horror movies which look like 80s classics. The 80s is where good horror/supernatural movies happened and Talk To Me fits right in there. It has got to be the best Australian horror movie I have watched. More of these type of movies is what is needed. I watched through the end credits as you never know if an extra scene might be in there but to save you time, there is nothing there :)",2023-10-06
"The RackaRacka brothers' first film achieves what it wants to achieve for the most part. It opens with a terrifying beginning that sets the creepy tone for the film. As I understand it, the film briefly touches on the social pressures of adolescence and how it sometimes forces them to do things they don't really want to do. Overall, it contains good performances, especially from Sophie Wilde and Joe Bird. The music matches the tone, the cinematography is good and the effects are amazing. I think these brothers have potential and they could make really interesting horror films in the future. 7,9/10.",2023-09-01
"Definitely one the best movies of this year and definitely on the top 5
All the actors did great job the story was amazing and new I Loved Mia and her back story with her mother's death the monsters/zombies/dead people were well made, there some gross scenes but not over the top I liked the scene where Danial and Mia in bed also I love that we just see things happening from Mia's point of view so we see the ghosts she sees only not what others see until and yeah the end was
I haven't watched many Australian films not tv shows but after this film I'm definitely going to discover more and more of Austrian cinema.The director and the writer did amazing job in keeping me on the edge of my seat highly recommended.",2023-08-08
"In the pantheon of horror cinema, few movies have struck a nerve as resoundingly as the standout of 2023, Talk to Me. Undeniably the most chilling horror experience of the year, it astounds on every conceivable level, from the intricate weave of its plot, to the exceptional casting, to the engrossing production value, every element exudes a remarkable immersive quality.Talk to Me is a disconcerting narrative revolving around a band of teenagers who seek a profound experience beyond the mundane, one reached by communicating with the spirits of the departed. A unique device, a ceramic hand, serves as a conduit to the other side, permitting the one who possesses it to interact with the spectral apparitions. The marvel here is that the creators of this piece of art are YouTubers Danny and Michael Philippou. Their amateur status is spectacularly belied by the professionalism that underpins their work, drawing favorable comparisons to veteran directors in the industry.The cast is where Talk to Me truly shines. Sophie Wilde is a revelation, effortlessly portraying a spectrum of emotions - grief, depression, and urgency - in a breathtaking performance that is undoubtedly the standout of the film. However, the commendable performances of Zoe Terakas and Miranda Otto cannot be understated, each contributing significantly to the film's overall emotional texture.The directors, the Philippou brothers, deserve special mention. Despite their roots in the more casual YouTube platform, they have masterfully navigated the intricacies of the film medium, thus blurring the boundaries between professional and amateur creators. Their feat serves as a potent reminder that the realm of cinema is open to all who possess the passion and tenacity to bring their vision to life.Talk to Me is a testament to the democratization of the film industry, a sterling example of what can be accomplished when creativity, resourcefulness, and dedication coalesce. It's an encouraging signal to aspiring filmmakers everywhere: you too can craft a masterpiece, regardless of your background.",2023-08-02
"First and foremost, I have been a fan of your YouTube channel for quite some time! I needed to say that!Anyway...to the movie!Once I heard this was created and the trailer came out, I was stoked. Not many can come out with a horror movie being your first movie and nail it! The creativity and the unfolding of how you wanted it to work got me hooked. I got to watch the interview of how some scenes became to be from your vision and it got me to fully understand on how you creative minds are brilliant! I respected on how you went with one direction of filming it vs the other and got to see what worked. I movie I recommend to all those who haven't. I know i've heard they want to go for more on other supernatural movies and i'm all for it. I want that as many can't get them to be what we want as fans. So, to Danny and Michael. I know you CAN!",2023-09-29
This had a solid idea and had almost perfect execution. This movie is a little over hyped and definitely doesn't possess the scare factor it promised but it did it's job. There are quite a few plot holes and question marks with a very lackluster climax and even slower ending. It was very one dimensional and focused on Mia way too much. They had other characters who could carry the weight but the writers clearly wanted the story focused on one character who hardly fit the role to begin with. I am hoping that the sequel is able to tie up all of Part ones loose ends but for now it is a very solid horror flick.,2023-08-11
"I absolutely adore the original story, the inclusion of talented actors who aren't typically seen in Hollywood films, and the stunning special effects. The dark lighting in this movie truly adds to the overall eerie atmosphere, captivating me throughout. In my opinion, this film is a remarkable work of art, and I eagerly anticipate the creation of similar movies in the future.With its masterful storytelling, exceptional performances, and spine-tingling atmosphere, ""Talk to Me"" sets a new standard for horror movies. The gripping plot explores the ethereal realm with a sense of unease that lingers long after the credits roll. The film's seamless blend of psychological horror and supernatural elements keeps you on the edge of your seat. Prepare yourself for a thrilling and unforgettable cinematic experience that solidifies ""Talk to Me"" as one of the best horror films released to date.",2023-08-17
"It's rude to compare, but in this case the occasion presented itself since I saw these films so closely together- and because the very criticism I made of ""Nun 2"" is so profoundly explained and exemplified in""Talk to Me."" ""Talk to Me"" provides nuanced, unique scares which strike a chord and settle deep into your psyche, unlike the rote theatrics and scare tactics of ""Nun 2."" I am being heavy-handed here, yes, but only because ""Nun 2"" had the potential to ""go there"" the way ""Talk to Me"" ""went there"" with it's deeply visceral and unsettling take on humanity's foray into the ethereal chaos of the spirit world. Both films mention the dangers of the supernatural realm but only one managed to stick a pin in that warning and deliver a gut punch to make you wheeze..! I wouldn't say this if I didn't have an idea (several actually..!) that could have produced similarly engaging moments for ""Nun 2."" Anyways, ""talk to me"" is a splendid, magnetic, and ultimately haunting movie which took risks and genuinely delivers. Amazing movie..!",2023-09-20
"Talk to Me was a good scary movie. I enjoyed it because I love scary movies. The movie was creative and kept me on edge. It is set apart from some of these so-called scary movies that have been out lately that was not that good. Talk to me was unique and not predictable. So, the writer of this movie did a good job and I look forward to another of their movies they will put out and hope it is a scary one also. If they decide to make a Talk to Me 2 then they need to make sure it is better than the first. A movie is good if it gets your attention within the first 15 minutes. This is all I have to say for now.",2023-09-14
"Okay, small budget, unknown actors, and no marketing to speak of... Those are all the reasons you should appreciate what this movie brings to the screen or now... even better... right into your living room!I went into this movie with no knowledge and low expectations, I walked out of this movie calling it an Instant Classic!This movie has an all too real physiological trauma induced beginning, that gets things started off with a bang; it had me from the start. The character development is quick and interesting enough to hold you attention until the fireworks get started.The Creepy Factor of the second and third acts of this movie are why this easily makes my Instant Classic list! Not over-hyping the movie here... just giving it the much deserved appreciation for the horror genre. This is my kind of horror movie, I put it in the ranks of the last Instant Classic I saw recently (Hereditary).If you haven't seen this... Do. If you don't yet own this... Do. If you have and you do, congratulations! Just don't watch it with someone that is susceptible to nightmares or anyone that gets bad feelings about possession type movies, because this one might just give them those bad feelings or those nightmares!Great little horror flick on a budget with no marketing and unknown actors. Great little horror flick!",2023-10-06
"The movie moves extremely fast. Little to no character development. Personal opinion the main character drove me mad, couldn't stand her. Seemed like a ripoff of Evil Dead. I don't understand why people enjoy this movie so much. I'm a total movie buff, especially horror and Talk to Me wasn't doing it. It's very predictable and the ending left you wanting more. I did enjoy the soundtrack of the movie- whereas the rest was barely tolerable. It's very unfortunate to because I was looking forward to it.TLDR; cliche, open ended, crap character development, too fast paced- almost made me feel like I was watching the movie in blips.",2023-09-19
"Well thank you Tiktok this time for introducing me to Talk to me. The plot is quite simple and full of Gen Z perks, up until the 2nd act that the whole movie becomes genuinely scary, and it keeps its way until the end of the third act. I like that they did not over-explain everything relating to the hand, the scary scenes are brutal and gory but not over the top. I like some humours as well, the acting is superb. The ending makes sense but it could be done better, regardless its 90 minutes run time. Overall, a very well made movie with genuine scares, very tense and fun to watch, for horror fans and non-horror fans.",2023-08-15
"The way the entire team performed is a true showing of hard work and beautiful connections. A group of mesmerizing people presented to us that no matter what anyone ever tells you, if you have a dream, idea, or thought that you want to pursue all you have to do is reach for it. Another note is how affective Australian audiences have shown there support in helping grow all the amazing people that deserve to be recognized. There can be many interpretations of what art is to someone but at the end of the day all anything is to you as a person is how it affects you. It makes you feel. Does it make you regret? What does it make you love or hate?",2023-08-17
"One of the most unique and original horror films I have seen in a long time. It's hard to fathom that Margot Robbies ""Barbie"" broke box office records and made over 1 billion dollars (considering I myself thouht it was just nonsense and silly) and yet here is this sleepy lil aussie horror that deserves soooo much attention. Must watch if you love horror. 5 stars. Well written, well made, Great acting. Congrats to all involved in this production. I will be looking forward to more work from this director. Also, the gen z actors did a great job. This film exceeded exepectations for me. Would watch again.",2023-09-12
"I've had this imdb profile for years and I have rated movies before but this is my first written review. Not because it's the best movie I've ever seen but because it really stayed with me even after I left theater. I was not only at the edge of my seat but there were even scenes that made me want to look away. I have never experienced that during any movie. And it wasn't just the violence, but the context of it. I love how this movie doesn't spoon feed the audience and it's still easy to follow. You most likely won't get everything on your first watch but it doesn't even matter cause the acting and script is what shines here and doesn't leave you confused like some other ""elevated"" horror movies do. I loved hereditary and midsommer but this one just took the top spot of my favorite horror movie of all time. I highly recommend watching in theaters cause the sound is just so satisfying. 10 out of 10 wouldn't change a thing.",2023-09-04
"I didn't expect much from this movie and was pleasantly surprised. The storyline is refreshing and even though it relies on the same scares, same ""good spirit/evil spirit""-issues and dysfunctional family plot as many other horrors in the past, it doesn't get too cliché, which I like.Although the movie has many good parts and a somewhat eerie vibe from the get go (the first scene sets the stage pretty well), my biggest problem with it is that it's just not particularly scary. The ""monsters"" are mildly disgusting at best and it misses out on a lot of potentially scary scenes. I am by no means a hardcore horror fan, and I still only found it to be kind of a sad/tragic family story with a sprinkle of demons.",2023-10-28
"This is a real surprise - an effective horror movie coming out of Australia. I don't mean to offend Australians but the industry there is not famous for producing really good horror movies.The story is logical, the direction very good and the acting is surprisingly convincing.I especially liked the twists and turns culminating in a very effective surprise ending. (You won't see many better endings in this category.)
All in all it is a very, very good horror movie.I especially liked the twists and turns culminating in a very effective surprise ending. (You won't see many better endings in this category.)

"A group of naive teenagers find thrills communicating to the dead via a paper mache hand, then watching over their antiques. Things then take a turn for the worse when these idiots let a young boy talk to the hand (pun intended).There was plenty of horror moments and the makeup was very well executed! Miranda Otto, one of the few likeable characters in this movie, played her minimal part very well! Unfortunately the story was focused on Mia who, as a character, was so unlikeable I had to keep watching in the hope that karma was given.I liked the way the film ended, felt like a full circle. Wonder if the other players involved in the game got the same outcome?Anyway, that's my summary of this film. Can't see how it got such high ratings, maybe purely for effects cause that's all this really had going for it.",2023-10-31
"Sure thing, my bad. Here's the revised version:So, ""Talk to Me"" had me on edge. It was so scary that I hesitated to step into my own kitchen after watching it, and that's saying something. I'd give it an 8/10 on the scary movie scale for sure.But you know what really got me thinking? The whole concept of purgatory they dived into. It's not something you see often in films or hear about in the real world, but it's the scariest idea of what happens after we kick the bucket - just endless nothingness and potential evil lurking. That concept is spine-chilling.Now, I gotta be real, the acting in the movie was kinda blah. And that kangaroo part? I mean, come on, we get it, you're Australian, but it felt out of place. I was hoping for a backstory about that mysterious hand too, like, did it make 'em high or something? It's the little details, you know?But when I think about it creatively, that whole endless nothingness in purgatory is a mind-boggling concept. It's what had me hooked. The execution could've been better, no doubt, but the idea itself was cool and kept me engaged.So, all in all, I'd say it's an 8/10. If I were creating that movie in my head, I'd probably focus more on the endless void of purgatory, but as an actual film, it had its flaws. But hey, it's worth a watch for that concept alone.",2023-09-23
"I didn't have a very high expectation going into this film but it definitely leaves you wanting a lot more! The plot is very well put together with a steady build up throughout and the casting is great and fits perfectly.This film will definitely leave an impression on you, it's been around a week since I watched it and I still remember it scene for scene. I've made it a goal to watch every horror movie of 2023 and for time so far this one is sat right at the top, not necessarily because it's the scariest but because the story is so solid.If you're looking for a great date night movie look no further.",2023-08-21
"Very good movie had me holding on to my seat the whole time very intense great actors aswell. Sophia wilde was amazing she made the movie for me because her acting was so convincing made the movie feel real. The guys who made this film should be very happy for themselves they started of as youtubers making funny videos to possibly creating the best horror movies of 2023 the whole movies was unique, intense, and actually pretty scary most horror movies these days usually cant pull that off but talk to me was not like most. Definitely the most intense Australia horror i have ever seen definitely recommend watching this movie.",2023-08-14
"I had high hopes going into this given the reviews and ratings I'd seen. I was expecting jumps and scares....but they didn't really come.There's was about five mins of gory which was a little shocking but it wasn't exactly ""scary"".None of the characters are likeable, they all seem to dislike each other immensely for no reason that is ever explained and most of them have terrible hair which is distracting.It felt like any other ""contacting the dead"" film, but there are many others done better which have jumps and scares.It wasn't terrible but it wasn't good - it was all just a bit blah.Skip it there are better films out there!",2023-10-30
"The character Mia annoys me.So when she returns to Riley's bed and saw what was happening in the spiritual world, she saw how Riley suffered in there but then she just freaked out and left?? Like Riley was a random boy who wasn't important to her. I thought she would want to figure out a way with her friends quickly like how to find a new way to save him.Also she left her dad bleed there after accidentally stabbed him...such a self-centered girl.The story was interesting though, I like how it scares people in a more subtle way, I only started to feel it after finishing the movie. The ending was great.",2023-10-28
"I took a massive break from horror. Once obsessed with the genre this is a brilliant idea and simple there are some things that are that we know what's coming but man when the credits rolled I stopped and took a few minutes and let out, ""damn."" Will rewatch this film multiple times to fully absorb it. Transitions were smooth and creative environment was spooky but not nightmare fuel scary just one of those movies you'd play for that friend that reacts easily to terrifying films. Gave me a feeling like Happy Death Day which was equally as fun and suspenseful. Can't wait to watch again down the road.",2023-09-15
"I don't usually write reviews but I was so pleasantly surprised by this movie I had to comment! I'm a fan of horror and suspense with an added flair for the supernatural...the gory slasher movies just don't move me. With that being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie...tense, suspenseful, great acting from the main character, and although they give the gore, it's done in a way that it balances out the scary which I greatly appreciated. A fresh take on hauntings, and definitely a film I hope they do good things with regarding the franchise. It's certified a classic that you'll want to watch again!",2023-09-24
"Although a good movie, there really is something to be said about how much A24 values self inflicted blunt force trauma to the head when creating ""shock and horror"".Weather it be because of a possession, falling off a cliff, or via bedroom dresser, A24, really loves it.That being said, I think it works well in this movie. It was truly horrifying to see a ""preteen"" do something so painful and hideous to himself while others around him were unable to help.Side note: I think this movie is made for teenagers and is built around the peer pressure aspect of high school and impressing people at that age. Watching as a 25 year old who never partied in high school, I found the movie scary, but I couldn't relate to it in anyway. Which made me less scared in the long run. I'd go home and think, well, I would never shake hands with that thing, so this would never happen to me. ¯\_(""-"")_/¯(In conclusion.... Better than Beau Is Afraid, but not better than Hereditary or Midsommer)",2023-08-16
"Out of the current group of psychological + supernatural horror films, perhaps none has as successfully combined grief, trauma, and shame as competently as Talk to Me (and I say that having loved the Babadook and Barbarian).Mia's choices are bad. But the film sets up reasons why Mia (and her peers) make the self-destructive decisions, with an obvious but not brow-beating comparison to drug usage and addiction.One thing this film does better in comparison to other films focusing on teenagers is the relationships with the parents. Miranda Otto is strikingly believable as an exhausted, overly-harsh mother with both a cruel and a kind streak. Mia's father is both distant and loving, lost in his own kind of impenetrable adult grief.The script doesn't try too hard to lean into teen-speak and allows the teenage characters to actually use acting skills to relay the relationships between them, instead of throwing a lot of corny exposition at us. The actor portraying Riley is entirely suited to a young teenager seeking approval from his cooler, older friends. The only slight negative is that the plot point with Mia's mother is a little overtread by other films, but Talk to Me is otherwise an incredible film that should stand out among 2023 offerings, even beyond the horror genre.",2023-09-24
"This film had so much hype around it and after finally watching it I was let down. First half of the film amazing has great tense moments but the scares start too fall short. This film was more suspenseful/creepy than anything else. I really enjoyed the cast all the actors were great. Film could have benefited from an extra 10-20 minutes of film explaining the lore better and maybe some kills??? Throughout the film there's only a total of 3 deaths - 1 of which is right off the bat and happens within seconds. I'm not saying we need SAW level of kills and gore but it needed more. The little brother I can't think of his name has some of the THICKEST PLOT armor i've ever seen he should have died during his first possession or at least be brain dead, not to mention fast forwarding later too the shower scene with him which is the best scene in the movie thats where he should have also died. So overall 6.5/10 should have been so much better needed more scares, less plot armor, more explanation into the lore all we got is ""It's a physics hand."" ""My mate gave it to me before he stabbed his brother & killed himself."" That's literally the only two pieces of lore given.",2023-10-07
"Cheap rip off, it tries to create an urban legend. But what it does it shows that storytelling still remains the heart of movies. Now, no matter how much you try to please the public you still need to study literature so that you can create a story. Unfortunately the streaming industry is promoting content above quality. The movie in it s essence is terrible. I mean if you are creating a circular motif ... studied better. Hence we are left with an incomplete plot. The acting is good, the direction as well, but the story is far from complete. Movies should be created by storytellers and not by people that can not understand this art.",2023-09-12
"So, after having had read the reviews after watching and seeing people's complaints. 1) I think they ARE supposed to be insufferable teenagers, 2) feels very to date with the technology being used (so everyone posting it online and recording it, and watching it) and how media effects people (and especially!!! Teenagers). Really, the only couple of things I didn't quite understand was how a 12 year old BOY managed to survive banging his head (with quite some vigour might I add) on tables and walls, several times and on two separate occasions. That would at LEAST leave permanent damage??? There was also a quiet moment after the boy was injured (first time round) when presumably they were all at a police station which was missed, and they all still had their phones on them and the hand? Surely that would have been confiscated, and then again later Mia managed to leave with Riley completely unnoticed... but other than that a good show. An enjoyable film yet quite a difficult watch (probably more so cringeworthy with the dog scene, the bed scene, the noise of the fingernails scraping against wood, the EYE). Would definitely recommend you watch it at least once.",2023-10-27
"I was absolutely taken back with how well this movie was made. When i heard ""oh it's made by a couple of Aussie youtubers"", immediately i had my expectations loweredBut this film, this fricken film, is AMAZING. I usually have so much to nit pick on, ESPECIALLY with new horror movies but this was just such an amazing movie to watch.The gore in it wasn't over the top, just enough to have you going ""ewww"" but not enough to have you covering your eyes, which is perfect 😈i've heard rumours of a second movie - in my opinion a prequel would be wayyyy better than a sequel. Show us the origins of the hand! Show us how it came to be! I want to see those first interactions with it, I JUST NEED MORE!!!!",2023-10-05
"The trailer seemed like another teen demon horror, but dang... This took me by surprise.The cinematography, non corny characters, acting, story, and writing, all blended far beyond what these genre type of movies typically have to offer. Great pace of intensity, scares, and portrayal of the demons. A24 never fails. This film is satisfyingly Horrific, On Edge, and Uneasy.The acting in this movie, specifically the main character, was just phenomenal. Not once did I disconnect from watching the movie. My Eyes were glued.I do wish some of the lore and story went a bit deeper, There could have been a few scenes etched on for increased tension. I appreciate how non cheesy and authentic this movie felt. Definitely a passion piece.Overall this movie was addicting to watch, wish it was longer.",2023-09-28
"I think the only reason this movie is getting good reviews is because there are a couple of young and somewhat promising actors the studios are trying to promote.As far as storyline goes, this Movie gets off on a good foot. Sadly, though, after you're an hour into it you start to wonder if it's going to result in at least one jump scare, which it doesn't.The acting is okay, but nothing I haven't seen before, and I definitely won't be ringing anyone back home to tell them to hurry up and watch it.Where is Ari Aster at when you need him. Get me some more flicks like ""Hereditary"" or ""Midsommar"". I had to keep a night light on for a couple of weeks agree this movies. And lastly, to the film's credit, I didn't predict the exact ending, but that was the only part of the movie that wasn't easily forseeable. This is sad, because A24 is becoming the only reliable home for the horror genre these days.",2023-10-14
"My issue with horror movies, is how many times they start good, and it makes you happy, anticipating a good time. But most of the time they just give up midway and destroy the ending: They make the characters stupid, things doesn't make sense, goes full action mode with cringe dialogue, etc....I don't think that was the case for this movie. The idea was really interesting, they give you hints, they don't spoon-feed anything, if you pay attention you'll have all the answers. You'll understand what happened and why, and you'll know the true nature of that hand, what it's purpose is.Most of the time, the more I'm looking forward to watch a horror movie the more it's bound to be bad lol (probably because the trailer has all the good parts...) . I'm glad it wasn't the case this time. The trailer was good, the movie was good.",2023-09-17
"This is an amazing and terrifying film. In the first year after my mother died, I would have done ANYTHING to talk to her again, this portrays that so well and I think a lot of commenters are too young to have experienced that grief that makes Mia make bad decisions. A really stunning film with so many scary moments - not least just how awfully the men and boys (mostly - the girls and women too at times) treat each other, so casually hurtful. Riley comes to his sister in fear and she turns him away? Painful. Anyway. Ignore the nay sayers and give this a watch. No plot holes that I could see! It's clear Mia wasn't possessed but the door was left open.",2023-11-01
"Overall was a good movie and kept me intrigued the whole time. I read some reviews saying the ending was silly or it didn't make sense to people...

"It was a really good horror movie ... for an indie production. The story the ran with was somewhat a unique take on contacting with spirits in this genre. The characters made the movie more captivating as each one of them was well played and written to suit the theme of teenagers partying and attracting trouble.The movie does well to deviate from the boring cliche of good guys fighting the spirits, losing friends in the way but altogether celebrating their victory, bathing in sunlight. As this movie looks deeper into the psychological battle the protagonist is having with her own buried family issues arising from the short-lived entertaining spiritual engagement.Regardless of it low-budget, the effects, makeups and cinematography still make the movie immersive enough to like somebody might be right behind you in a dark room. But that's where the potential of the film is not seized. As much as I love it for being its own movie in the repetitive horror movie scene, it would be great to get some proper jump scares, or any type of orthodox horror scenes, it had its fare share of blood and guts which made it irky to look at but I was looking forward to possible jumping out of my seat with my heart pounding. Would have loved some classic horror vibes even though I do rate its effort to be its own movie.",2023-09-20
"Going into the movie I had pretty low expectations and not because of the trailer or the cast. But because this movie just going off plot alone, seemed like a fun horror movie to watch with no real stakes involved. The movie was well worth the watch, especially for a horror fan. It never made me angry in the way some horror movies are just garbage. I spent the majority of the time on edge and getting gut punched with legit uncomfortable and scary scenes. Nothing was ever truly that scary and I'm glad the movie wasn't longer. They consistently kept you waiting to see what happened next and I was on edge after the movie really got into the plot. Very unique and def reminded me of telling ghost stories as a kid.",2023-09-27
"Having seen the trailer, the only conclusion I took is that it was high production value, however it did seem that the story is not going to be of much interest to me.I gave it a chance because I had no idea what to watch on a Friday night and boy, I was not dissappointed.The story evolves alongside the backstory of the main characters and you understand and feel the context of their development better.The cinematography and camera movement are extremely good for a B rated horror movie.While the story itself is not something very original, the execution and special effects give it a higher value than your average ouija board horror flick.Don't miss this title for the Halloween, it is definitely one of the good ones for 2023.",2023-09-23
"It is worth watching though not more than once. The story is modern exorcism spiced with the lives of a bunch of teenagers who tend to rebel. The story begins with a shocking scene followed by an intriguing storyline. Though I myself am not a big fan of slasher horror movies, the brutal scenes are quite bearable. The exorcism scenes aren't scary at all but can be considered creepy to some extent. To put it in another words it definitely lacks the scare factor. Comparing with other horror movies released in 2023 such as Cobweb and the last voyage of demeter, it's just a one-time-playable entertainment.",2023-09-15
"For those who are used to clumsy and long-winded scripts, this movie manages to break that habit. Which turns out to be just one of the movie's great points.The movie is one of those that gets straight to the point, without any jargon, but still giving some content and a complete story. The performances were impeccable, and the plot twist really is a plot twist... so much so that it left me wondering when it all stopped being real and if it ever was.And there's more, usually teenagers have been painted as very unusual, and this movie surprised me in that sense too: here we have ""innocent"" teenagers who try to make fun of things, reminding us that it could be us living this horrifying Experience.The soundtrack is wonderful, the highlight being the second act.What a rich production!",2023-09-18
"Great movie! Thriller level is higher than the scare level and the makeup was on point. The only thing missing is an ultimate ending explaining exactly what the endpoint was. Some could surmise that both characters passed, or that her sacrifice saved Riley but it's unclear as to what exactly happened. Overall worth the purchase and time, but they could've laid things out better.Was it Riley? Was it Mia? Did the friends meet the consequences of their decisions to mess with the undead? Were Mia's efforts in vain and why was the character on life support... so many questions were left to the imagination. Still a great movie!",2023-10-28
"I'm so glad that I missed this movie and couldn't see it in cinema I had to pause the movie and I screamed a bit too.I don't usually get scared from horror movies but this is different, from the beginning you know something bad is going to happen and if you and the slow burn is so terrifying. The thing that made me scared the most is that I could see myself in the movie and that if I had the hand all of this could happen to me it's just one stupid idea that me and my friends would reject at first but would consider trying and we could get addicted to playing with it. Overall this is a solid movie with a great story about how it was made and I hope you could read more about it after you see the movie.",2023-09-25
"I just watched the movie and i absolutely loved it especially the acting that was captivating and to see how far the directors went from youtube videos to this and with the budget they worked with the more reason that i think that this is a totally amazing horror movie with barely any jumpscares which i also love and can't forget about the ending how it was pretty simple to understand,i saw some people complaining about how it felt dragged but to me i felt like that was a development to the story that got me more emmersed,so to conclude this i would say this movie is absolutely worth the watch.",2023-09-12
"Talk to Me is a 2023 Australian supernatural horror film written and directed by Danny and Michael Philippou.The film follows a group of teenagers who discover they can contact spirits using a mysterious embalmed hand. At first, the teenagers are excited by their newfound ability, but they soon realize that they are messing with forces they don't understand.Talk to Me is a well-made and suspenseful horror film. It has a unique concept, and it does a decent job of building tension and atmosphere. The film also features strong performances from its young cast.PROS:Unique concept: The idea of using an embalmed hand to contact spirits is original and intriguing, and its underlying of drug use correlates with the movie's overall theme.Suspenseful atmosphere: The film is well-paced and there are some effective jump scares.Strong performances: The young cast of Talk to Me give strong performances. Sophie Wilde is particularly good as the lead character, Mia.CONSRushed ending: The ending of Talk to Me is a bit rushed. The filmmakers try to tie up all the loose ends in a hurry, and it doesn't feel entirely satisfying.Additional thoughtsTalk to Me is worth watching for fans of the horror genre. The film's unique concept, good performances, and some effective scares make it a worthwhile experience.",2023-10-28
When I was I kid and was waiting in the queue for an epic terrifying rollercoaster I counted how long the ride took and then I knew how long I had to hold on. That same feeling I experienced again when I saw Talk To Me in the cinema! I almost wanted to look at the time. Because I really felt terrified and I wanted that the film was over and the lights went back on.. So I would felt less terrified.How they did it? Fortunately not with too many jump scares but the Philippou brothers did an excellent job! Even if you realise this is the first feature film of them. Everything was great. Especially Miranda Otto who made the film a little bit lighter with her humoristic mother role. I really needed that. The story was original and the horror elements were quite realistic. Best horror film I have seen in a decade! Maybe since The Blair Witch Project?,2023-08-20
"What a wild ride! 'Talk to Me' is about the summoning of spirits that are stuck within limbo, and how to NOT do that if ever offered (lol). Very unique storytelling and captivating from start to finish.I haven't seen a horror film in a long time that was this enjoyable (last one for me was Hereditary) and this one is on the same playing field as Hereditary.Highly recommend it. Keep an open mind when watching and it will keep you engaged throughout. The run time was perfect. Did not drag on too long, and the ending was **chefs kiss**. Excited to see what they do with the sequel. Bravo Philippou brothers!",2023-09-13
"I've seen a few reviews on here saying this is a great horror film, and as far as originality is concerned, I can maybe understand why.However, as far as I'm concerned this is an absolutely shocking movie. I couldn't watch more than 20 minutes because its so awfully written it beggars belief.The first minutes are spent watching someone break a door down because someone has locked themselves in a bedroom at a house party. This person then proceeds to stab the person who has broken the door down. No explanation, but okay - I'll go with it for now.We then cut to a scene involving a girl who goes to pick up who I presume is either her brother or her girlfriends brother, and on their way back after screeching sia's chandelier bump into a dying kangeroo because Australia. The younger brother naturally asks can't you put it out of it's misery before she screeches past it in her car.At this point I switched it off. It's a terrible b-movie and impossible to watch.",2023-11-01
"John Kramer is told he has just months left to live, he's given home of a new treatment, a life saving surgery being held in Mexico, when it doesn't quite go as expected, he takes his revenge.We're at the point now where new horrors just aren't sticking, hardly anything looks worthy of a follow-up, so we're getting endless Scream and Halloween movies, all of which seem to diminish with time, Saw though has been different, could this later one offer something new?This latest film really does offer something new, it's unlike any of its predecessors, very much John's story, it's all from his point of view, we're almost made to feel a degree of sympathy for him, it's very, very clever. There's a monster even greater than John Kramer.I should be used to the macabre deaths by now, but once again they manage to shock and horrify, there are some nasty moments here, a girl a few rows in front of me was actually sick during the second death scene, it is a very nasty moment.The pace is unlike any other Saw movie, deliberately so, I found the build up very interesting, the fallout was very exciting, not for the faint hearted.Tobin Bell delivers yet another excellent performance, he really does shine once again, and credit to the makeup team, you see a physical decline in the character as the movie develops, it's very well done.It made me add The Hollies to my playlist.Is that the end? I doubt it, I doubt it very much.8/10.",2023-09-30
"The Saw movies are those we go into with the lowest of expectations, and even then there have been instances of utter disappointment (think Saw 3D or Jigsaw). But now, for almost the first time since Saw II in 2005, there finally is a ""good"" Saw movie. Yes, actually good.Saw X does two very important things that make it work so well. The first is that we now have a movie where John Kramer is finally the main character. Rather than having to learn about him through his victims, like was so for the 8 other movies he was in, we finally get to know John Kramer through John Kramer. The second is that we're finally on John's side, essentially rooting for a serial killer, because the ""players"" in this movie are written to be some of the most disgustingly scummy people on Earth.Saw X is much longer (with a runtime of 118 minutes) compared to the 9 other movies (all of which average at 90), and is paced much slower too; which quite honestly works really well. The games are decent, the violence is unwatchable (which in Saw language means it's good) and we also get a few fun Easter eggs.There is yet one major disappointment, but that's spoiler territory since it has to do with the ending, so I will ignore that for now. Other than that, the movie was surprisingly good and I honestly did enjoy it more than I thought I would. If you have been keeping up with the Saw movies, definitely go check it out in cinemas!",2023-10-05
"I had the honour of attending the world premiere of this film tonight. I think at this point it would be pretty hard to argue that 'Saw' is the most consistent horror series ever made. To be 10 films in and still putting out masterpieces is something we really shouldn't take for granted. And 'Saw X' is a masterpiece in my opinion. This film was everything I wanted and more.The motivations of John Kramer and whether they are justified or not has always been a great discussion among horror lovers and 'Saw' fans alike. This film is very aware of that. It makes multiple references to this debate and they are done in a way that is both slightly tongue in cheek and also deadly serious coming out of the mouth of Kramer.This film is a little different to others in the series however. This time we have a revenge plot and no matter where you stand on Kramer, he is likely going to be your undisputed protagonist here. I thought the revenge element was a brilliant addition to the series. It adds another layer to the depravity that we are witnessing and makes everything so much more layered.The movie is probably the most patient in terms of set up the series has seen yet. It takes quite a while for the movie to get all its ducks in a row and get down to the nitty gritty business. Once it does though it is relentless the second half of the film moves at an electric pace.This film was incredible. I couldn't have asked for more. 10/10.",2023-09-28
"I have never said this about a horror movie, but i enjoyed the non horror part more than the horror. The backstory of John Kramer was good just as Tobin Bells acting, but the rest is a typical, even sub-par, Saw sequel.A huge pet peeve of mine is when writers are dependent on coincidence and luck instead of logic. When they steer characters and actions in the right direction with dumb or illogical decisions and dumb timing, just to force the script together. Or if they just don't understand themselves how dumb things are.One of the most glaring ones in Saw X was when it's ""revealed"" that Parker Pears was in on the scam. He were just as suspicious as everybody else on the site as a fake patient to make everything look more believable and therefor not very revealing.Another one is the setup of Johns final trap. Firstly, the coincidence of the kid playing soccer late at night, at the right time, and them noticing him, which fantastically goes GREAT with the rest of the setup. What luck.And John's plan was to cross his fingers that if they got overpowered, they would be chained up in that trap. Both would go get the money before he/they died in the trap and stop the trap by grabbing the money bag, setting off a new trap. And the door to the room didn't even close at once. It took 20 seconds until it did and they stayed in the room to look in the bag instead of leaving or securing the door, like normal people would - especially when the situation involves a person who's fond of traps. So John's plan involved another lucky coincidence that they wouldn't exit the room at once and possibly kill them all anyways.All in all, besides one really good trap (the lady sawing her leg off) and the first part of the movie, this was not a good watch.",2023-10-21
"4 out of 5 stars.Saw X is a good horror film that takes the franchise into a whole new level which has more of a story than letting blood and gore take over. Yes it does have blood and gore but focuses more on John Kramer perspective as he goes after a group of scammers.The film starts out a little slow with John going to Mexico. Discovering a group that saves people from there terminal illness. Only to find out they scam people for money while they don't perform the miracle surgeries. He grabs each one and places them into bloody traps for there redemption.Good plot. The traps are brutal and gory. But the film does not let the gore take over while letting the story be the focus group. Great cast ensemble lead by Tobin Bell. The films plot twist was good but the fate on one character in a trap is left with a little disappointment. There is a mid credit scene that will leave the fans surprised. Overall, it may be a fresh new direction for the franchise and it was really needed.",2023-09-29
"Saw X definitely has the gruesome goods expected of a Saw film however, what makes this entry really good is the unexpected amount of heart. It's a personal tale of revenge that's oddly wholesome, using its concept to make its traps and victim's suffering enjoyable viewing.Front and centre like never before Tobin Bell gets to lead this one and it's absolutely all the better for it. The relief when he believes he's cured and the realisation it's all fake is heartbreaking which makes him easy to root for. Also, his bond with Shawnnee Smith feels so genuine.Kevin Greutert's direction is really good, it's the same style that the rest of the franchise has but as a prequel trying to match that same aesthetic it works. The traps here are inventive, gross and believable, it's only the final one that feels too nice for the monster it's meant for.Charlie Clouser's score still uses that iconic theme at the end, which will honestly never get old at this point and before then it still avoids going unnoticed. As the first half is mostly trap free the score itself is nicer and more laid back.",2023-10-03
"I swore I'd never see another Saw film after the abominably bad ""Saw 3-D"", but after seeing some good reviews and hearing some positive word-of-mouth I decided to jump back in with Saw X. While the movie isn't particularly bad in and of itself, the entire experience cemented for me that the Saw franchise is now entirely insular-able to be enjoyed by the franchise die-hards but perhaps not so much by more casual viewers.For a very basic overview, Saw X tells a John Kramer (Tobin Bell) story. Battling the cranial cancer that was a plot point in many of the Saw sequels, John is told by traditional medicine that he has only months to live. But after discovering an experimental treatment in Mexico, the Jigsaw killer heads south of the border. Discovering corruption, he devises a new ""game"" based on his patented grisly devices imparting morality plays on their victims.Like I said, on the surface there isn't a ton wrong with Saw X. In fact, of all the series sequels it might be the one that hews closest to the spirit of the original. All the key franchise elements are present and John unleashes a series of new moralistic challenges upon unsuspecting victims. There are even some ""easter eggs"", of sorts, that devoted sequel fans will likely be delighted by.The problem-at least for a viewer like myself-is that I enjoyed the original Saw film as exactly that (a movie), not necessarily a concept. In 2004, that genre-bending combination of shocking horror, psychological thrills, moralism, and detective procedural was unlike anything previously seen. But of course, something can only be original once. Since that point, the flicks essentially double down on the traps, narrative structure-playing, and pseudo-morality plays. It is now very much a ""known quantity"" franchise.To be fair, there are many of these-James Bond, superhero flicks, Liam Neeson romps, etc. Different strokes for different folks, to be sure. But while watching Saw X, it became clear to me that Saw films have now turned into exactly that-known experiences. One doesn't watch a Saw movie to marvel at the overall filmmaking experience any longer-it is now for insiders to see the next wave of traps, hear Bell's iconic voice, see the doll on the tricycle, and lapse into the wicked morality scenarios.Thus, for me, this film didn't work all that well because I am not one of those insiders. Director Kevin Greutert and writers Pete Goldfinger & Josh Stolberg may have crafted a decent film, but it is for the long-termers-likely not new fans or ones (like myself) who compare everything with Saw in the title to '04.",2023-10-19
"'Saw X' returns with fervor to the franchise's unsettling realms, aligning its haunting narrative to explore the exploitation inherent in the current anti-big pharma rhetoric. Despite its stance, the anti-big pharma movement is just as profit-driven as big pharma; but as depicted here, its unregulated nature can lead to highly destructive actions severely impacting individuals' lives.At 81, Tobin Bell reprises his iconic role as John Kramer with remarkable vitality, maintaining the character's haunting grip on the audience with his enduring portrayal. It was also a nostalgic and incredibly rewarding experience to see the return of Shawnee Smith as Amanda Young.The narrative is seamless and compelling, guiding the audience through its labyrinth of moral quandaries with an impactful flow.The victims in this installment are framed as some of the most deserving in the series, heightening the film's moral ambiguity and intensifying the notions of retribution among viewers.Despite the climactic twist being predictable, it retains its satisfying essence.'Saw X' is a compelling blend of socially pertinent themes, stellar performances, and satisfying narrative, providing a lingering experience. All in all, it's my second favourite film in the saw franchise.",2023-09-28
"I'm a huge fan of this series. I love the original 7 and I mildly enjoy Jigsaw and Spiral. I was excited for another chapter and was not disappointed. This is a great addition to the series.Just like with the other sequels, this continues to add layers to the backstory and lore with interesting new material. And of course we have lots of cool and gruesome traps. But in many ways, this chapter is different from any of the previous.For one thing, it takes it's time building story and character. The pace ends up slower because of this, but I think it's worth it. Everything feels more fleshed out (unintended pun). We don't see the hyper-editing style this franchise is known for. And the movie overall feels a bit higher in quality of filmmaking.My only downside is a lack of surprises, for me at least. I think it might work better for people who aren't as familiar with this franchise as I am.I had a fun bloody time with this movie and look forward to any future chapters in this series. More games. More blood. More, please. (1 viewing, opening Thursday EMAX 9/28/2023)",2023-09-29
"""Saw X"" is a film that tells a more personal story of John Kramer, the script successfully achieves this purpose and also provides an excellent change in the character of Amanda Young, giving her a lot of sympathy. Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith excel in their characters not as villains, but as redeemers of troubled people and this theme is further deepened in this tenth part. The cast includes Norwegian Synnøve Macody Lund, and Mexicans Renata Vaca, Octavio Hinojosa and Paulette Hernández, all of whom give good performances. The cinematography is well done and the director's work is noticeable. Definitely this film co-produced by The United States, Mexico and Canada achieves great old school gore effects (except for a couple that are digital) and mainly shows that more human side of John Kramer and Amanda Young, resulting endearing. A great tenth part of this franchise!",2023-09-28
"Maybe it was my fault I didn't know what to expect since I don't usually watch trailers, so I didn't know this was a prequel, but even knowing that I can't help but think that this was sooo generic, yeah of course everyone is happy to see Tobin Bell playing the role of John Kramer again, or even to see again Amanda, but do they really think that just because they bring back 2 og characters will make this movie good?The whole problem with this entry was it contributed absolutey nothing to the series, not new characters to the lore, not a single hint of all the other disciples or copycats that are actually alive, or the detectives/policemen, nothing, just more traps that fullfil the shock value and that's it, it just ends up to be another revenge generic movie.At the beginning I was ok when this will get interesting? Never happened, these movies have always been characterized for their plot twists as soon as the iconic Hello Zepp theme starts (even if some endings are pretty bad) and I had faith that at the end it will have some mind blowing twist, but no, when the songs starts it's just closes the doors where the bad guys are, and John is like: ""HA! It was all part of the plan"" and that's it, I felt insulted for trying to sell me this when it has been done like 10 times before.Seriously, all I want is a real ending for the whole series, I wanted to see a big duel of the disciples vs copycats with the detectives involved or something, but no, with this movie they are just laughing to our faces saying that they will milk this franchise because we keep saying this kind of movies are entertaining and the only thing we want is sadism and no story.And by the way, this has again that sepia filter because obviously it was filmed in Mexico and that is how Mexico looks like in real life.I don't get the huge ratings or why people keep saying this is the best entry since the first one, or one of the best horror movies of the year. Hugely dissapointed.",2023-10-25
"The movie starts off interestingly, but ends being more unrealistic that I remember most other Saw movies being.On John's primary location in the movie, it would probably take John months setting up all his equipment and traps, but it happens in a few days. Also, everything just works with the traps and victims - kinda contrary to chaos theory where you know something unforeseen usually will happen. People were made to suffer in horrifying ways without fainting - and to do things to themselves during a few minutes that even skilled surgeons can't in such a short time.Maybe if John had months to prepare his location and to set things up - and maybe if persons had at least 15 or 30 minutes to ""play the game"" instead of 3, just maybe this movie could have been slightly realistic - or possible.Many things happening felt totally impossible within the movie's time frame - and totally unrealistic knowing how normal persons respond to severe pain and blood loss.I did not enjoy the acting either, it all felt fake. I'm a great fan of especially the first Saw movie, Saw X was to me a waste of time and money.",2023-09-30
"When considering horror franchises, how many come to mind that have worthwhile sequels that live up to their originals? Now take it a step further and consider how many horror franchises make it to a tenth installment, and then how often is that installment any good? These are the questions one might ask when thinking about Saw X, the tenth installment in an exhausted (and exhausting at times) franchise that arguably peaked at its inception but gave at least a few worthy sequels. Saw X delivers above and beyond all of its predecessors beyond its original work. Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith are front and center for this one, a questionable choice that pays off at the hands of creative writing and strong direction. It's difficult to stay fresh at number X but they manage it here, going back to basics and bringing a little humanity to that series antagonists. Bravo to those involved, because to do this takes work but they managed it here with aplomb. The traps are fewer but this is a Saw movie so they are there, and they are brutally effective when on screen. But like the original we're back to really focusing on the story and not just the brutality. I won't say this is the most surprised I've ever been by a movie but it ranks, because upon hearing that a new Saw was to be made my eyes rolled hard, but seeing the positive reviews I just had to check it out and it lives up in every way. Are you a diehard fan of the franchise? Then this is for you. Did you lose interest after the first. This may also be for you, because nothing has come close since 2004.",2023-10-06
"My biggest problem with these prequels is that the characters don't look like themselves. Amanda and John should look 20 years younger than they do for this to work and it really takes me out of the movie.The boss woman's speech near the end is way too long and cartoonish. They could've just killed everyone, even without a working gun, and just leave the place with the real money bag. What's up with not checking the gun and just assuming you get a fully loaded pistol handed to you after pointing it at others?How does everything always work exactly like planned by the way? Especially for someone who gets fooled with a false cancer treatment?As the synopsis states, this movie happens between the first and the 2nd movie, hence my title - Saw 1.5.I gave this a 6 because I think it was interesting enough and better than some of the sequels. It was also good to see more Kramer than before.",2023-10-15
"The original Saw movies were never my favorite genre, but at least they were shocking and realistic. None of that is to be experienced in this cheaply made B-movie.The bad: the sole purpose of these Saw movies is that the audience wants to be shocked by revolting violence and torture scenes. But what if these torture scenes look laughable? That's the case with this flop. There isnt any horror at all and the supposedly shocking violent scenes put me to sleep.More bad: ofcourse this is just a money grab from Hollywood producers cashing in on the name of this once popular movie, but this movie is almost entirely cast with B or even C listed movie actors, who usually would at best star in a tv commercial at the homeshopping network.Beware, this is a complete and utter dud! Boring from start till finish.",2023-10-11
"Yes it's entertaining and there is a plot twist as usual, although it is obvious that Parker is an accomplice of Cecilia as soon as he shows up at the warehouse.The finale game is underwhelming compared to other games played in the movie. Valentina has to cut her own leg, Mateo has to open his own skull, Gabriella needs to shatter her own hand and foot. And Cecilia's game? Just to kill a guy, that's it.I mean, throughout the movie Cecilia has demonstrated her callous behavior. When she saw her accomplice died, she was thinking ""one less person to split the money"". I don't see why the finale game is challenging for her nor give her a chance to ""reborn"".... She would have killed Parker anyways if given the right circumstances.The cinematography and gruesome scenes were nicely done though.",2023-10-25
"A character like Kramer would never go for an expensive procedure without researching it properly to be in the position he ended up in, but it is a movie so gave it a whirl.So the traps....someone completes their trap in the allocated time but you decide to just stand by and let them die? What's the point in the game then.All of the traps are basically impossible to be able to completed, so once again why not just kill them.The ending we all saw coming :
We know Amanda and Kramer are both going to survive because it's a prequel.One final woman left but two chains.The tune we all know comes on.Flashback scenes commence.Are they ever going to make one of these where the person being tested is actually a likeable character and comes out alive?Think it's about time the script was flipped.",2023-09-30
"Not going to lie, my expectations were low, based off the fact that the previous saw instalments haven't been very up to standards. This movie takes place in between saw 1 & 2, following the life of John Kramer, a cancer patient. I won't get into the story here but there are some pros and cons to this movie. The traps are immaculate and absolutely disgusting (In a good way), and it's a more ""horror"" styled movie. Horrible things happen to horrible people, and you can't help yourself from sitting there and thinking, ""please don't be over, please don't be over."" Overall I would give this movie a 7.5/10, it exceeded expectations, the gore was great, and the story is pretty good. Would recommend to see in Theatres.",2023-09-27
"In 2004 I saw my first modern survival horror film in Saw. I watched it because I'm a big fan of Danny Glover(Predator 2 1990, The Saint Of Fort Washington 1993). The film was directed by James Wan in his directorial debut. He later went on to direct some cult horror and action movies like
Dead Silence and Death Sentence both released in 2007 and the first two installment of the horror franchise Insidious(2010-2013). He also directed the first two installments of yet another horror franchise in The Conjuring(2013-2016).Now Darren Lynn Bousman is credited with directing parts 2,3 and 4 of the Saw Franchise. He was a director I had great hopes of becoming a legend. However this was not true. After the Saw movies he sunk into oblivion. He resurfaced when he directed the Saw spin-off movie Spiral: From The Book Of Saw(2021) starring the acclaimed actor comedian Chris Rock.In my personal opinion Saw 1-4 are worth your time. The rest of the franchise is mediocre. The spin-off movie Spiral was actually a homage to the fans of the franchise but I don't consider it a part of the Saw films. In my opinion if you wanted to own one movie in the franchise, then go for Saw 3.Saw 3 is one the best revenge/horror films I've seen in my life and Angus Macfadyen the actor who played Jeff, a grief-stricken father who was consumed with vengeance after the death of his son Dylan in a drunk driving crash, was the reason why.Okay now onto Saw X. I think this is a prequel to the 2004 film. It shows the backstory of John Kramer a.k.a Jigsaw. The movie shows the part of his life and the circumstances that led to committing the acts that he did. Shawnee Smith makes a welcome return. Though I'm not such a big fan of hers, she is quite a talented actress. Costas Mandylor(Saw 4) also makes an appearance. The film has gory and grisly traps that are a trademark of the Saw films. So the film is interspersed with both story and horror elements.Verdict: well, if you seen all the previous installments then this would be just another useless add-on film. I think they should've stopped after Saw 3 which meant sense because they wanted Saw to be a trilogy. Saw X isn't a clever film, rather it is dull and predictable. There is another film quite similar I've seen called Mindhunters(2004) directed by Renny Harlin and Escape Room(2019) directed by Adam Robitel. P. S. Not to forget to mention the Cube trilogy of horror films(1997,2002,2004). Thanks for reading this review and as Mister Spock says, ""Live long and prosper"".",2023-10-22
"...or should I say jovially? Or juvenile? Because there is nothing serios about this movie, except it seriosly put an end to a milked franchise.I expected something like original movie at least, but I will never trust these ratings anymore. There are a lot of movies rated around 5.0 that are better than this overrated mess.I must say, some scenes are really well filmed, and there are some gruesome stuff like every Saw movie, but in the end, it only got +2 rating from me. Why? Because everything else is bad. From cold/blue scenery to warm/yellow change when in Mexico (groundbreaking), to unbelievable ending which feels really amateurish. Not even one likeable character. But, I would say it wasn't boring. So, fans of the previous movies and superhero no-brain-needed lovers, enjoy.",2023-10-14
Saw series dont hold any high standards in film making. But this movie is practically flawed in plot. The movie starts of well but soon loses complete logic. The traps were limited and dont even feel that innovative. The stupid things happening in this movie are literally unbelievable. For instance the child conveniently turns up playing football in the middle of the night in that location! Jigsaw's partner having sudden empathy for a victim she was ready to butcher a minute ago? There is just too many coincidences for Jigsaws plan to work here. It was a torture to watch this movie. This franchise is dead and rotten.,2023-10-21
"No spoilers here but before I begin I'll just say - DO NOT leave the cinema as soon as the credits start playing! There is a post credits scene shortly after the main credits start (not a long wait) and you don't wanna miss it. Sadly in the cinema where I watched almost everyone else left and missed it, so I hope enough people will read this and stay for a few more minutes.The movie takes place between the first and second Saw movies (I suggest remembering at least the summary of the first 3 movies before watching), which was the prime era of the franchise. As a big fan of the franchise I actually came with extremely low expectations after the last 2 movies (especially Sprial) and was ready to be disappionted again, but this really ended up being above all expectations. I think they really managed to bring back the nostalgia feeling and this is easily in the top 5 of the movies in the series.The veteran Saw fans will remember the feeling of waiting for a new movie to come out and the excitement, where each movie is leaving you with a taste of more and you just can't wait to see the next one. I think that feeling was lost in the 8th and 9th movies and this movie totally brings that feeling back. I enjoyed every second and I can't explain how much I missed feeling like this about a movie, as only the old Saw movies could make me this excited. I could watch 10 more movies like this and I was even willing to rewatch that one again as soon as it ended. The actors are also all great and it was amazing to see some familiar faces again (though I wish there were more), I'm also so glad Tobin Bell got to be the main character in another Saw movie, even at his age he can carry this perfectly and we can never get enough of him.Only 2 minor downsides - one being that I wish there was more new lore to it that affects other movies, this one was very focused on the current story which was very interesting to learn but I would have loved to see more background lore and more old characters coming back. And the other downside is that with this being a classic Saw movie, I believe true fans who really know how Saw movies work will be able to predict majority of the story and know where all of it is going, like the twist in the end is great but is also not shocking because by now we know how those things work. But even when I could predict the storyline I still enjoyed every single moment of it and would totally rewatch it in the future, so though it's not a shocking masterpiece like the first movie I still think they did a great job and I wish we would get more of this level of Saw movies in the future, because after watching this I sure want more.If you are not a long time Saw fan maybe you wouldn't be as excited as me, but I think you will still feel like this was a decent movie at the very least.",2023-09-29
"Saw X is, as the title suggests, the tenth entry in the Saw franchise. It feels like this movie was made for no other reason than to have that cool title. The best way to describe this film is that it's another Saw movie. I'm a fan of this franchise. I've seen (and own) all of the movies thus far. I'm a huge fan of horror. Saw is my favorite horror franchise ever. There are certainly horror films I like better, and Michael Myers is my favorite horror icon, the Saw films are my favorite horror franchise in that there hasn't been a single film in the series thus far (including this one) that I've outright hated.The original Saw I would put in my list of favorite horror films. It has cemented itself as a horror classic like Halloween, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, and so on. I would recommend it to any fan of horror or thrillers. Saw II & III are also fairly good. While the sequels that followed don't measure up to those three, I can still enjoy them as fun entries. Parts 7 & 8 are definitely the low points in the franchise, but even those I don't hate. What's cool about the Saw movies (at least parts 1-7) is that they all connect with each other. When binged it feels like you're watching a season of television.But even I can say that this franchise is beyond played out by now. This movie, while certainly not awful, proved me right on that. The reason I saw (pun intended) this in the theater is both because I am a fan and because I had never watched one of these films in theaters before. I always knew about the franchise but had never gotten into it until a few years ago.The film also has a high score on Rotten Tomatoes, which really surprised me as critics have never been kind to the Saw movies, not even the first one. Some even say it's the best in the series. I definitely would not go that far. I would say Saw X is better than the Final Chapter (or Saw 3D) and Jigsaw, but certainly not better than the original. I would also put Saw II & III above this. I would say this is on par with Saw IV-VI.I would put it on-par with Saw VI especially, as the two films have a similar plot. They're even directed by the same person I believe. That's one of the minor issues I have with Saw X is that it has a bit of ""we've been here before"" feeling. This film deals with corrupt doctors who take advantage of terminal cancer patients with a fake cure for money. Throughout the film you see them all get their comeuppance. It's similar to part 6 where you have corrupt health insurance agents that take advantage of their customers to save money.However, this film takes a bit of a different approach to its storytelling. Aside from one token trap at the beginning there are no gore/death scenes in the first half. It's all build-up. It's one of the better-looking Saw movies with some nice location shots. It also focuses primarily on John Krammer for once. Tobin Bell as John Krammer has always been the best thing about this franchise, so it's cool to see him as the protagonist for once. It's also one of the longest Saw movies to date. I imagine all of this is why critics seemed to like this film more than previous entries. It doesn't feel as gratuitous and all about the violence like other films. But when the trap scenes happen, they're inventive and gory, like one would expect from these movies by now.However, since this is a prequel, these things can make the film feel slow and boring in places for diehard fans like me, who have seen all the movies, since you know how it's ultimately going to play out. Also, the main cast looking quite a bit older here does take me out at times. They didn't even try to make Amanda look younger with makeup for this.This film also falls into the trap (pun intended) many of the Saw sequels have, where the traps get a bit convoluted. It's hard to believe that Jigsaw could plan things so thoroughly, and nothing goes awry for him. This film isn't as bad as some of the others at this, but it's there.Overall, if you're a diehard Saw fan there's no reason not to see this if you haven't already. I'm going to buy it on Blu-ray when it comes out for the collection. But if you've never been a fan of the franchise this probably won't change your mind. If you only like the first movie, but not any of the sequels for how gratuitous they become then don't bother with this either. It was nice to see Tobin Bell take the lead role once in these. This can work as a decent swan song for this franchise, assuming there will be no more.But we all know there will be. Even though there is nowhere left to go for this series there will always be more as long as there is money to be made, as Hollywood has shown us over the last couple decades. This goes double for horror movies like this, as they don't cost much to make.",2023-10-05
"I wasn't exactly happy getting into this, partly due to unrelated theater mishaps before the screening. Right before ""Saw X,"" I'd just come out of watching ""The Creator,"" where the theater staff had mistakenly played the wrong movie at the start; ended up watching the opening scene of ""Barbie"" before they finally corrected the mistake. People were pretty mad. And then during the previews and cinema ads for ""Saw X,"" I spotted a rat in the theater, which unnerved me to say the least. So, I wasn't in the best frame of mind to begin with. Startled me and left me feeling a bit annoyed. Throughout ""Saw X,"" especially during the slower scenes, I couldn't help but glance around and even lift my feet off the ground, wondering if the rat was still lurking nearby.Regarding the movie itself, I wasn't particularly excited about it, especially since I found the previous Saw movie ""Spiral"" so boring that I couldn't even finish it-a rare occurrence for me as I usually try to sit through any movie, whether I like it or not. But, I went to watch ""Saw X"" mainly for nostalgic reasons. I remembered how we used to spend hours discussing the various deaths in the series during my school days.As expected, ""Saw X"" delivers on the gruesome and gory front; anything less would have been a letdown. It's uncomfortable to watch, and that's all you need to know because has there ever been another reason to watch a ""Saw"" movie? Lol.John Kramer's back, albeit looking a bit older despite the movie's timeline. His morals are questionable but somewhat pure, though I wasn't as emotionally invested in his character. He designs these diabolical contraptions, so by no standard is he a good person. Instead, the movie introduces even worse characters so that we find ourselves rooting for John with a slightly clearer conscience. He's less of a hero and more of an antihero or judge.The movie does feel a bit drawn out, and I found myself impatiently waiting for it to get to the games. It felt like unnecessary filler. We know what we came to see, the director and writers know what we came to see, so let's get to business already!! Once the gruesome and bloody deaths kick in, it's all good. The in-between moments don't hold up as well, but the gruesome scenes compensate for that, a little. I did wish there were more victims than just the 4 the movie mainly focuses on; so other than Valentina it felt like the deaths were somewhat stretched out.So yeah, I don't think it's contending for best movie of the year, but definitely best deaths of the year. I didn't enjoy it as much as I remember doing when I was a kid. Definitely wished it was paced quicker. It's a mediocre movie with fantastic deaths that might be worth the watch if you're a fan of the franchise.",2023-09-30
"Finally, the softer side of Jigsaw and Amanda! ..said no one ever.This movie discards nearly everything that made the other Saw films scary and great horror films, and pushes to the forefront everything that was peripheral. This weakened the film terribly.What did they discard? Jigsaw's anonymity to the subjects for one. The subjects in past films almost never faced Jigsaw and his minions directly, much less had conversations with him. That anonymity...the tape recordings...the lack of human contact...that was essential for the atmospheric dread that was a key mainstay of previous films....all they saw was the Pig mask and Billy (who has just a brief cameo in Saw X). In past films, even if Jigsaw or Hoffman or Amanda were watching, they did not interfere. In Saw X, they kept the tape recordings I guess out of nostalgia, but there was no logical reason to do so, since they were staring at the subjects through a window and talking to them with a microphone and loudspeakers anyway (the subjects could even see John and Amanda through the window). Not scary.This film discarded toying with the notion that maybe Jigsaw and co. Aren't villains, but maybe they're just misguided and really good at heart...no, it shoved that right in everyone's faces. Mystique? Gone. Horror factor? Dialed way down.This film really made an effort to discard the things that worked in the other films. The atmospheric dread that was critical in setting the tone of past films was removed, and instead we got heart-to-heart talks and second guessing. I'm guessing the writers and producers did a lot of second guessing too.The first act of the film was far too slow and soft. And where was Jill??? The eyeball trap never happened, it was all in John's imagination. That's fine, but it was all too obvious that the hospital in Mexico was a scam, and that they were all future subjects. It was way too predictable.Was hoping to see some planning of their games and some setup behind the scenes. But actually the peak of the movie for me was when the subjects got abducted. Best part of the movie hands down. But still not as scary as past films.They threw an albeit small metaphorical bone to horror fans by having some nice gore scenes from the traps which were fairly clever.But the moment John put that collar around his neck he beclowned himself and sucked out any sense of horror the movie had, and just made the audience feel sorry for him and the boy and rage for Pederson. I know it was ""all part of the plan"". But the plan sucked. Allow yourself to be sprayed with blood and tortured, just to sell this plot twist to the audience? And then just to gas Pederson and her buddy? Some climax that was. Did anyone feel that Pederson stabbing her lover was the climax of the movie? It was right where the climax should've been, but was instead incredibly anti-climactic.If all that wasn't bad enough, the evil ringleader of the hospital scam, Pederson, who probably deserved to die more than anyone, was allowed to live. Poison gas??? Really? Nothing cool like she has to bite and gnaw off her own body parts to look for a key but it was all just a scam? I'm spitballing here, but it's closer to what she deserved.There was not even a ""game over"" line or a slamming of a door to lock her in the building. What a missed opportunity to salvage what little chance for good fan service they had left.My predictions for Pederson:
100% chance she survives and escapes
100% chance she returns to scamming people (despite John saying she's done her last con)
100% she'll be in the next film if there is oneShe caused the most suffering and yet suffered the least. I wanted some guarantees that that building would be her tomb, and the movie gave me none.Gabriella played a minor accessory role in the scam, and yet had her face melted, hand and foot broken, and finally her neck broken. She didn't deserve that.I love Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith. But they gave their characters too many lines. That showed their age, and certainly didn't add to their mystique (""oh are they really good, or bad evil villains?""). What it did was unmasked the villains and evaporated their mystique factor. Saw X turned into a horror movie without a villain. And without a villain it's just not scary at all.Lastly, I hate to say it but John and Amanda looked old. It could have worked for John since he's a cancer patient but he was also a cancer patient in Saw 1 and 2 and was much more energetic in those. They didn't seem to even try to make them look right for the time setting. I would've forgiven that if the movie wasn't such a mess otherwise.",2023-09-30
"Saw came out in 2004 and was a decent little thriller done on a low budget with a pretty scary little scenario. The one room setting was effective in establishing just how sinister Jigsaw is and how gruesome this franchise would become. Over the years once then, countless gory, cheap sequels came out to cash in on the franchise and establish Jigsaw within the ranks of Freddy and Jason.Frankly, those movies were cheap made, cash grabs, released around Halloween and forgotten by thanksgiving. Bottom line: the sequels stink!Fast forward to Saw X and now a worthy film to the original movie has arrived. What worked in 2004 has been brought back to what's going on now. The story line is simple, it's not revenge but a redemption of sort where those who do evil to others get a chance to make things right--or die by their own hands. Medical scammers are the metaphor here for the people selected in jigsaw's latest games. Con artists who prey on the vulnerability of people wanting a last chance of hope to survive cancer. I found myself rooting for Jigsaw here, even with those gruesome traps that had me clinching in my seat with those noises of flesh tearing and blood squirting. Still, I'm not saying they deserved it, but they had it coming. They victimized the wrong cancer patient and even when the culprits are brought to jigsaw there is no remorse of the main evil person responsible for ripping off vulnerable sick people. The third act was very satisfying and the conclusion great. Stick around for the post credit scene. Trust me, you'll want to.",2023-09-30
"Granted my expectations weren't particularly high given the most recent additions to the world of Saw, but I was pleasantly surprised to find it was well above my expectations, possibly even being my favourite Saw movie yet. I had to knock off a star for some of the twists being just a little too predictable, and with a few scenes feeling a little anticlimactic, in particular the very end. Regardless of that definitely worth seeing, particularly on the big screen. Do yourself a favour though and avoid all trailers like the plague, I checked it out after watching the movie and it's one of the worst offenders of ruining the whole thing.",2023-09-28
"This franchise needs new blood. Now with ""Spiral"" they tried that but it was made by a filmmaker that has been in the franchise already. Again with Saw X we have a filmmaker (who isn't good at all) who has been here before. A cast that has been here before & a screenplay that has most certainly been used before.This is film is not great and I understand die hard fans love the characters and the traps and the twists at the ends but for me this is just garbage. The traps are so dated and not where horror is anymore. Also the filmmaker is awful. Some of the worst camera work in any of these films. It's all just been done already. The difference with this one is they really let Tobin Bell act.He is the only good part of the film. While his acting isn't great he is giving it his all for this terrible franchise. He is the only reason to see this terrible thing. Stop making these films. Let's stick to the new original horror that's been coming out lately.",2023-10-06
"It is impossible to explain why Saw X is such a disappointment without spoiling it, so I'm gonna have to do just that. This tenth installment in a series that should never have gotten ten installments starts off surprisingly strong. John gets scammed into paying $250k (apparently torturing people pays quite well) for a fake cancer treatment and he's not too happy about it. The setup is slow and the movie is almost an hour in when the killing starts to take off. It's definitely not bad though. The treatment story is done quite well and especially the scenes where Jigsaw and his little sidekick gather the victims are really quite good and make great use of silence and sound to build tension.Once the traps get going, they get really intense. The first trap, the eye one shown in all the promo material, is just a little daydream John has. It's a bit of a letdown, but it's still quite brutal. The bomb-arms for the taxi driver felt lackluster, but that's forgiven when the real villains start their traps. There's some unmatched brutality in here, and it's all shown in intense, gory detail. It's what we're here for and Saw X delivers. For a little while I almost started to get my hopes up.The issue with this movie starts in the last thirty minutes. Up until this point, the movie has been building up the main villain, Cecilia, as a pure evil being, almost laughably so. She likes killing kids, she wants to murder all her friends and she lives only for money. She's rotten to the core and you expect her to get her comeuppance in a fittingly brutal way. That would have been a fine ending to this movie. Just a brutal kill for Cecilia. It would've been cathartic and well deserved. But the writers had other plans, and they're pretty hard to grasp.The last 30 minutes of Saw X are spent on ridiculous plot twists and double crossings that make no sense at all. As soon as Parker Sears barges in, the movie goes completely off the rails. Senseless monologues, deus ex machina kids, terrible acting by Steven Brand and worst of all: no karma for Cecilia. The villain that this movie has spent 90 minutes building up eventually gets off Scott-free by sticking her head through a gloryhole. That's it. No disembowelments, no amputations, no lobotomies. John pays off the kid he scarred for life with a bag of illegally obtained cash and they walk off into the sunset, leaving Cecilia to continue scamming and/or killing kids if she wants to. That's John's moral compass for you.This complete lack of repercussions for Cecilia is just a kick in the balls and is the worst part about an already terrible ending. It ruins what could have been at least somewhat of a revival of the series and turns Saw X into nothing more than some decent gore scenes that leave a bad aftertaste because they happen to the wrong characters.",2023-10-31
"The Good
Story wise, the movie did a great job developing John Kramer character.The Bad
First of all, you can probably tell what's gonna happen after 20 minutes in the movie. The setup with the fake treatment screams scam and you know that the rest of the movie will be about revenge. Of course, it is reveal that the treatment is a money grab and nothing was done to John.Then, when all the ""participants"" are setup, there's 2 majors clues that let you know where this is heading. The first one is the fact that Amanda puts the confiscated phone on a cart that is very within reach of the participants, almost like she wants them to be able to get it (which is the case).The second clue is that you can clearly see that the trap made for the main scammer needs 2 persons but she's the only one tied. Later in the movie, she's able to make a quick call saying ""I was kidnapped"" before Amanda throw the cellphone away. Not long after, one of the previous patient arrive, screaming that he's here because he got scammed and that he want's his money back. In the middle of the night..... yeah right.Of course, the patient is the husband of the scammer and proceeds to free her. They then ask to John and the little kid to tied themselves on the game originally intended for her. What's bogging me the most about this twist is that even if it was planned by John, he or the kid could have died if the couple just had a little more patience. But no, they decide to go BOTH searching for the money, hence triggering the ""real"" final trap and releasing John and the kid.Finally, let us not fool ourselves. We go to these movies mainly for the traps.The first one, apart from being just imaginary, was too easy. Getting your fingers broken (on only one hand) is nothing compared to what we know of Jigsaw.The brain operation trap was creative but there's absolutely no way someone can pull it without doing brain damage to himself, preventing him to finish the job.Other traps were basically ""cut yourself"" or ""break some bone"", I was expecting more elaborated machinery.",2023-09-29
"Was this better than the last 3 movies (Saw 3D, Jigsaw, and Spiral)? Sure. But it was a 4/10 rather than the 3/10 those movies were. Hardly a return to form.The setup was revealed in the summary you read when you choose whether to rent this movie, so they spoil the reveal before you even start watching. This is not a scary movie, but a revenge story. It might as well be a subpar John Wick with traps instead of guns. There are no jump scares and rarely any tension.The main ""bad guy"" being tested ends up being a sociopath - not an even slightly interesting character and not a single hint of moral ambiguity. It's not unprecedented in the series to have an evil or irredeemable person die in a trap, but literally none of the tested in this movie turn out to be remotely likable. You don't root for their ""redemption,"" you're just waiting for the blood spray and screams to end so the plot will move on. There was no journey the characters went on where you wondered will they/won't they change. The characters are just...flat.The twist at the end is weak. I am literally the worst at figuring out reveals, and even I knew what it was (even if I didn't know all the details). It was not a shock and had no emotional weight. And we don't even find out how the final trap ends...or even exactly how it works!I also spent a lot of the movie trying to figure out what the hell they did to the lovely Shawnee Smith's face. I can't tell if it was awful CGI de-aging, if she's had plastic surgery, or if she had some kind of allergy she was suffering from during filming, but it really did not look quite like her. I am not trying to be critical of her looks - it just looked differently enough from her previous films that it was distracting. It would have been less weird if she'd just looked her current age, despite this being a prequel.Honestly, this movie was a major disappointment. Even Saw 6 was twice as engaging as this movie and had similar themes related to greed and taking advantage of the ill and dying without conscience. By the end of that movie, the main character was human, with complexity and an emotional journey that changed him. Not so with Saw X. It misses the mark and I cannot for the life of me understand why I keep hoping for a return to the compelling storytelling we used to get from this franchise. Shame I can't return it.",2023-10-24
"As a major Saw fan, I was excited to see the return of Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith. While Jigsaw was a great film, it missed the mark as a Saw film. Spiral on the other hand to me was a disaster with the Saw name slapped onto it. Saw X was a breath of fresh air to the franchise. Tobin Bell was a real stand out in this entry, using emotions we haven't previously seen in the Jigsaw killer was a real treat. Honestly could be regarded as the best sequel, it is the best entry since Saw 6. With the upgraded cinematography and almost two hour run time, Saw X feels like a real film and not a cheap slasher film. The film feels different to the other sequels, though in a positive way. The two hour run time allows for characters to be better developed and have more down time between traps. Shawnee Smith returning as Amanda Young was brilliant, expanding on John and Amanda's mentor relationship was brilliant and something well needed. The post credit scene was brilliantly done, not too much but enough for major Saw fans like myself. The positivity towards this film gives hope to another sequel (prequel?). Major Saw fans will enjoy and it's a great entry for casual Saw fans too.",2023-09-28
"'Saw X' is the 10th instalment of the long running Saw franchise, and to be honest I was highly sceptical of this film being yet another quick cash grab at a franchise that has already finished its conclusion and the last couple of entries namely (The Final Chapter, Jigsaw & Spiral) were downright awful. However, this one is a solid return to form as it not only gives you the chance to gain back some nostalgia after some of the later films failed to deliver, and along with plenty of extreme gore and plenty of twists and turns, this definitely ranks as one of the best of the franchise.The plot takes place between the events of Saw 1 & 2 where John Kramer (Tobin Bell) travels to Mexico for a risky and experimental medical procedure in the hopes that it will cure his cancer. Only to find out that the entire operation is a scam. John decides to take his revenge by teaming up with his sidekick Amanda Young (Shawnee Smith).I have always been a big fan of the 'Saw' franchise and every year I always looked forward to the latest entry beginning with the first one from 2004 all the way to 2010. But even I had to admit that the later one became even more worse and convoluted as time went on. This one breathes new life into the series and by having it take place when the title character was alive was a smart move by delivering a solid premise that adds an emotional angle to the story which instantly invests you into the drama of the storyline and the second half of the flick is where the violence really amps up with nothing held back and reminding us of why the franchise is loved in the first place. Okay there are some small flaws such as some of the twists and turns, you do see coming, but that doesn't spoil your enjoyment of this in any way. By taking place at an earlier time the movie cleverly side steps the confusing continuity of the later films and instead tells a focused narrative and its all the more refreshing for doing so. The directing by Kevin Greutert is strong with stunning cinematography and plenty of extreme close ups that captures the graphic violence beautifully.The performances here are top notch with Tobin Bell making an outstanding comeback as Jigsaw by easing back into the role perfectly, this is probably his best performance of the entire franchise. Snawnee Smith also delivers a fantastic performance as Amanda, and it was just a treat to have her back. Synnove Macody Lund provides a solid and twisted performance as the cold hearted and murderous Doctor Cecilla and the rest of the characters were good if a little one note.Overall 'Saw X' is not the best of the series, but easily the best since part 3.",2023-10-04
"The Saw saga takes us back several years with this tenth installment where we learn a little more about Jigsaw through his eyes. The saga has always been told through the eyes of the police, the victims and others connected to Jigsaw. At no time has this character been known more in depth than through flashbacks about his beginnings and his operations. This movie does what was really needed and that was to learn more about Jigsaw through his eyes to better understand the reasons for his actions. Here we see the other side of the coin where Jigsaw is terribly deceived and the perpetrators responsible end up falling prey to him. That helps a lot to better understand the character, since he has always been represented as a villain, but with a just reason why he subjects his objectives to his games. What has always been interesting about Jigsaw is his code, which seems to be based more on ethics than anything moral. Throughout the saga, the victims have mostly been people with a dark background who Jigsaw tests to see if they really deserve to live and if they are willing to make a physical or psychological sacrifice to find redemption. The self-mutilations even end up being an allegory about the meat sacrifice that consisted of cutting off a finger to atone for sins. Jigsaw fits perfectly into the list of villains who were always right to commit his actions, despite how cruel and inhumane they may seem. Here the philosophy of the saga becomes much clearer when the ethical-moral conflict arises of whether it is necessary to act outside the norms of society to do what the system cannot. Saw plays very well with that element, which continues to make it interesting. The film maintains the essence of the saga and has brutal deaths as always, although the film feels quite simple and short despite its length. You could say that it is simpler than the first installment. Saw My final rating for this movie is an 8/10.",2023-10-02
"Well I have to say, this is a genuinely fantastic film and I'm so glad I watched in the cinema for maximum viewing pleasure. Plot was fantastic, acting was very good and it has everything you want in a saw movie.I think I had the thoughts of most when this was announced, ""why another saw film"" and I fully anticipated an almost gimmicky movie that was just a quick cash grab. However, this couldn't be further from. The plot gives us so much more in terms of depth with John Kramer, he had a much more central role and the writing makes you feel things for him you likely haven't felt before in any previous film.The plot had a couple of great twists and turns. It didn't feel as one dimensional as the previous few instalments. I was genuinely guessing how this film is going to turn out and I can honestly say it has all the gore and torture devices you want and need in a saw plot. It's made in a way where even if you haven't seen any Saw films before you could watch this enjoy and understand it, which is also fantastic for new viewers.I would happily rate this in the top 3/4 Saw movies and would easily recommend for both fans of the franchise and for new people to get started. Solid 8/10 from me today.",2023-09-29
"First, what makes the difference between a good Saw movie and a great one? Tobin Bell. What a great comeback. The man is 81 and what a great interpretation. Great talented actor. I mean, it is the movie where you see the most accurate picture of John Kramer. Definitely, not "" The monster"" some people thinks he is.Second, Saw X it is probably the best Saw since the second one and probably the third. I should rewatch all of them again, but I think it could be easily battling for top 3. Great Job done here.Third, don't forget that a good Saw movie needs a great script. Saw X has everything you need to enjoy if you're a fan of the franchise. The movie is original, yes original, and mix all the ingredients pretty well. Not the usual torture movie.Last: what made my day watching this too, was Amanda and Costas Mandylor back to business. I mean, back to basics. Excellent.So, overall an acting class from Tobin Bell, underated actor, and great interpretation from the old cast. It is a new and original addition to Jigsaw universe. Probably the most touching one. Hope not the last one, I want more continuing from here.",2023-10-20
"Amanda and Jigsaw are too old! What is the point of this film? To introduce another dose of plot holes? It can't be suspense or anything like that. Why would he reveal his and Amanda's identity so early? Why use the tapes and Billy at all?The original trilogy worked because of the suspense an charisma but also because it sort of made sense. Movies 4 - 6 were OK but 7 - 10 just introduce completely implausible timelines.If you watch closely, the original trilogy happend from about mid/late 2002 (stage 4 brain cancer, chemotherpay, car crash) to early 2004 with John hiding from late 2003 - being unable to walk (hemiplegia). So, when did Jigsaw grew his hair back for this movie? When did the recover from this surgery? When did he recover from the car crash? This simply doesn't make sense.",2023-10-03
"Saw X was something that was needed for us Saw fans, we get to see a more human side of John Kramer which we were not used to in previous movies, and also we get to see another villain than Jigsaw which were not used to either, you will have empathy with John Kramer in this movie for all the things they made him go through. Amanda comes back, Hoffman comes back too, the scenery in Mexico is beautiful and the plot was really good, it's been a while since we had a good Saw movie because the more recent movies were just mid or not that enjoyable and this one was a treat. It's as good as the first 3 movies.",2023-09-28

"Hard to believe the same director and writers that produced the trash of the previous few installments, could deliver such a strong and refreshing take on the Saw franchise.For seemingly the first time - Saw X takes pause to develop story and characters, which does a beautiful job at building tension in anticipation for what you know is coming, and the pay off is more grizzly than I could have imagined...and boy was it grizzly.In addition to the 'poster trap' being (in my opinion) the most visually iconic, and eerie looking trap in the whole series. The 'Twist' in Saw X, is that the movie is surprisingly good.9/10 for a Saw movie. 7/10 as a regular movie.",2023-10-07
"I´ve just arrive to watch the movie few hours ago and its a pleasure to me report that this movie perfectly has all the things that made saw (2004) a great movie, those spins that make you say WOW or WTF. My score as a saw saga fan was 9 just because saw (2004) nowadays its a classical of the new horror movies but, if that movie had the krammer perspective despite the research or the police point view it could be better, this movie its a return of that jigsaw in krammer eye´s and the result is a more personal experience, all characters work great the games have the perfect balance between live and death and that remainds to the first 2 movies of the saga and All of us jigsaw´s fans were waiting for that essence to return and well that day arrived.",2023-09-28
"If it sounds too good to be true then it probably is. That's what ""Kramer"" (Tobin Bell) ought to have thought when he was presented with a miracle cure for his terminal cancer by ""Cecilia"" (Synnøve Macody Lund) for a mere $250k. Anyway, off he goes to Mexico and then quickly discovers that it was all a con. A really cynical con at that, and so he decides that some gruesome revenge is due on the team that dreamt up this atrocious scheme. What now ensues is one of the best horror thrillers I've seen for ages. The assembled ""medical"" team find themselves tracked down, apprehended and then attached to some fairly ghastly devices in a sort of brutal version of the ""Adventure Game"". Great sacrifices are going to have to be made if any of them are to survive! Further complications follow when another victim of their scam - ""Parker"" (Steven Brand) turns up bent on his own kind of revenge... It's violent and brutal, this film, but we are spared the very worst of the graphic imagery and that actually helps us to do our own visualising as limbs start coming adrift. There's not a great deal of dialogue, which is good, and the score doesn't resort to the creation of jump moments for us - that's all left to our eyes and our imagination. There's a twist at the end but it's rather weak and does rather let the thing down a little. All told, though, this is very much at the better end of recent films in this genre and in a dark cinema is well worth two hours.",2023-10-09
"I like the first two Saw movies, and I'm not sure which of the others I've watched, maybe all, maybe just some - I don't remember them at all or at least not much. Saw X is not something I would recommend neither to horror enthusiasts nor hardcore gorehounds. It's quite boring, and the concept of creating torture games for unfortunate individuals feels stale, like drinking leftover beer from the day before. We get some torture and gore but everything feels rather like a (bad) joke. I must admit that the writers attempt to introduce new and fresh ideas regarding the torture methods, but it ultimately feels like old news, and as we know, old news is dead news. Anyway, Saw X is not a complete failure, but it's far from being good either.",2023-10-24
"This movie was surprisingly a very good movie. Even though I know that the ""Saw"" series is a gore and violent movie, I love this series very much. ""Jigsaw"" was a disappointment, but it was still ok. The movie ""Spiral"" was terrible. This movie was a very good comeback movie. The characters were good. We get to know the character of John Kramer better in this movie. The movie also had an emotional side. I liked it, in fact I liked it very much. I think this movie was the best movie after the first movie. It was still exciting to hear the song after a long time. At the same time, I was excited to watch another ""Saw"" movie and it was very good, and I had a lot of fun in the cinema. I also liked the ending of the movie. By the way, I unintentionally laughed a lot at a scene in the movie. When John Kramer came to Mexico, they used yellow effects again. This is funny and cliché now. Normally Mexico is not like that. Anyway, I really laughed when I saw the yellow effect in the Mexican scenes. Anyway, it's great, congratulations!",2023-10-07
"A return to roman numerals also marks a return to form; 'Saw X (2023)' is not only the best 'Saw' film since 'Saw VI (2009)', it's the best 'Saw' film since 'Saw II (2005)' (or 'Saw III (2006)' at the latest). Set between the events of the first two movies, a more appropriate but less Xtreme title for this would have been 'Saw 1.5'. It marks a massive shift in perspective for the series, not only abandoning the cop subplot outright (which makes it perhaps the total opposite to the disappointing 'Spiral: From The Book Of Saw (2021)') but also putting its audience firmly in the shoes of its reoccurring villain. Having Jigsaw be the hero (or, I suppose, anti-hero) of the piece is a bold choice and the story does very little to obfuscate the fact that it essentially believes he's entirely in the right here. To achieve this without resulting in total tonal whiplash, it turns the tables on its varying victims by having them - or, at least, their ringleader - be outright despicable. The first portion of the piece is actually fairly slow, as it takes its time establishing its terminally ill protagonist and the inevitably doomed journey that gives him hope before cruelly snatching it away. Tobin Bell absolutely shines in the role, portraying emotions that you wouldn't think John Kramer is even capable of and - perhaps even more surprisingly - showcasing his basic decency towards people who aren't encroaching on his moral code. He really sells the emotional devastation that is inflicted upon him and does a good job at getting you to forget that his character is a violent psychopath... at least until his engineering alter ego comes back into play, that is. Even then, though, the movie is firmly on his side and most of his actions aren't portrayed as being outright bad, even though two wrongs obviously don't make a right. The way his story ends is almost parodical considering what he has done and what we already know he is going to do, but I won't say anything further for fear of spoiling things.Although I do miss the days where Jigsaw was a scary psycho whose sanctimonious moralising was almost always entirely misguided, his position as a sympathetic cancer patient who gets viciously scammed out of his money and decides to take revenge on - sorry, cause a ""reawakening"" in - his scammers does work surprisingly well. Of course, there is the argument to be made that Jigsaw losing his funding and not getting cured of his cancer is actually a good thing for all those unsuspecting would-be players he'd be able to force into his games during the plentiful years of his fruitful life. However, the piece alludes to the fact that John Kramer's potential new lease on life would inspire him to put down the Billy doll once and for all and it also makes it clear that the scam he's targeted by has already ruined the lives of many less morally questionable marks. The game that eventually kicks off has a distinctly different feel to it, as we're typically in the perspective of its creator and only switch into the perspective of its players as they participate in their individual tests. It somehow manages to make us both want to see them suffer (or, at least, it ensures we understand why they are) and want to see them make it out okay; in that sense, it puts us into Jigsaw's headspace because he sets up these traps in the hope that they cause a moral shift in those caught within them rather than in the hope that they fail (in his own twisted way, he's trying to help these people while also ensuring they don't cause further harm - either by having them reevaluate their life, or by taking that life out of the equation). It helps that none of the traps are rigged (bringing the OG trapper back will do that) and that some of the games are actually won, as this ensures you're on the edge of your seat throughout each sick set-piece and are never just waiting for their foregone conclusions. The traps are all as gnarly as you'd expect, making use of toe-curlingly convincing special effects and being properly conceptually uncomfortable. A couple of them are a bit of a task to sit through, which basically means that they do exactly what they should and are far better than the contraptions seen in the more recent 'Saw' movies (the highlights are, for me, the pretend phlebotomist's trap and the trap that targets two individuals who you'd have thought would be totally off the table). There are elements of moral greyness when it comes to the selection of victims, because most of them seem to be down-on-their-luck individuals who only participate in the con due to their vulnerability and lack of viable alternatives. Their free will is what compels Jigsaw to include them in his game, but it's undeniable that they aren't exactly in the best position in life and are representative of the killer's unfortunate tendency to target those affected by things like addiction. Only a couple of them - those specifically in charge of the operation - are undeniably bad, and the flick goes to great lengths to establish their outright evil nature by giving them no semblance of remorse. Their lack of moral code pushes them to do things even Jigsaw sees as truly reprehensible (even more so than the initial scam itself), which is somewhat cartoonish but also kind of necessary to make sure that everyone in the audience is actually on the protagonist's side - at least when it comes to those specific characters.Although the big twist of the picture is somewhat weak in the sense that it doesn't exactly blow your mind (a lot of it is fairly well telegraphed and its repercussions don't extend beyond the finale), it still works as a satisfying element of a cathartic conclusion that's ever so slightly disappointing in terms of how it deals with certain characters but is still suitably enjoyable and makes good use of the series' signature 'Hello Zepp'. Plus, the piece is still entirely unafraid to flashback to scenes from mere moments ago as it crafts its various 'gotcha!' moments and that's still as counterintuitively fun as it ever has been. The cutting in general is really good, evocative of the same hyperactive frenzy so readily associated with the franchise but also more restrained when necessary. It's perhaps no great shock when director Kevin Greutert's name also pops up underneath 'edited by' in the end credits; the veteran 'Saw' filmmaker has been with the series since the beginning, cutting the first film in an apartment he shared with director James Wan and co-writer Leigh Whannell before going on to edit every entry in the series prior to his directorial debut (series highlight 'Saw VI (2009)') and then returning to the editor's chair after his second stint as director (series lowlight 'Saw 3D (2010)') for 'Jigsaw (2017)'. The only film in the series he had no part in was 'Spiral: From The Book Of Saw (2021)', for which I imagine he's thankful, and that makes him just as integral to the franchise as Tobin Bell himself. He's a bit of an unsung creative hero when it comes to these movies and his latest outing almost feels like the culmination of his talents both behind the camera and in the cutting room (it's weird to contemplate describing a 'Saw' film as an example of the flawed but well-known auteur theory, but here we are). The result is not only that the tenth film in a horror franchise is easily one of its best entries, but also that this is perhaps the closest one of these features has come to looking genuinely great outside of the gnarly low-fi style that the fantastic first flick so cleverly adopted to stretch its budget to its absolute maximum. It's wild that this reportedly cost less to make than both Chris Rock's offbeat effort and Greutert's own cheap-looking last attempt. Although it doesn't seem as though it has been deep fried in human fat like its most visually visceral predecessors, it nails the look and feel of the earliest and best 'Saw' flicks by adopting a crisp yet grungy colour palette that makes good use of sickly yellows, ominous reds and uncanny greens to craft a beautifully ugly aesthetic that perfectly frames the sweaty, blood-soaked sadism which fuels the meat-and-potatoes of the narrative. As clichéd as this sounds, it looks like a real movie and I'm all here for it.Ultimately, this is a really entertaining return to form that's often properly suspenseful and benefits greatly from its behind-the-scenes talent. It may be a bit too slow in its first act, but it makes up for this with its rock-solid remainder. Its traps feel like classic 'Saw' scenarios and are every bit as gruesome as you'd expect, often playing with irony and being equally as conceptually and viscerally upsetting. Its distinct villain-as-hero perspective is bold and only occasionally feels a bit icky. I will say that it might be worth getting John Kramer firmly back in the bad guy seat he occupies so comfortably next time around (there's only so much you can do with him on the other side of the fence), but this is a refreshing take on the character that makes you think about the morality of the particular situation he finds himself in. The feature's limited links to its predecessors are just overt enough that they'll please fans of the series without being off-putting to newcomers. I haven't spoken much about a certain character because I don't want to spoil too much (even though their involvement is revealed in the trailer), but I will say that they're a great inclusion and their dynamic with Jigsaw is as satisfying as ever (sadly, the pair perhaps don't get as much time to bounce off each other as you'd ideally like). It isn't a masterpiece, but it's way better than you'd expect it to be and it hits that sweet spot that most of the franchise does in that it may not be the best movie you've seen recently, but it makes you feel as though it is. It's pretty great, to be honest, especially if you enjoy this series as much as I do. It's one of the best 'Saw' films, for sure.",2023-10-05
"If you're like me, because of the sheer number of movies in this particular franchise, you go sort of in and out in casual fashion toward it. After the first couple great movies, I was ready for a break. Checked in once in a while to see some of the others and was left extremely dissatisfied. Somewhat enjoyed the recent two films for their slightly different takes. But finally we get a saw film that is nearly the same caliber of intensity and perplexing as the original classic.What surprises me the most is that this Director who has worked on past saw films was able to finally refine the best aspects of the franchise and create somewhat of a ultimate finale of sorts. While I am sure, there will be more spin offs. If this is it, for the particular story arc I can accept that due to how impactful and just absolutely decimating this film is. It brings back a couple familiar faces and focuses much more on Kramer, which is undoubtedly the most intriguing part of the Saw Saga. Tobin Bell gives a performance that is up there with his best work and is featured much more. The writing for this film is a step up as well and the dialogue and plotting never seems cheaply cobbled together like some of the other films. The set pieces are obliterating and , comical, all the while being incredibly clever. Brutality is once again on full display, which has become a natural element of the franchise.Overall, what really separates this sequel from the many others is that it goes back to the source and delves into morality, decisions, and the human character. The elements that made the first saw film so brilliantly executed.",2023-09-28
"I have to admit, I'm a fan of the ""Saw"" movies and I was super excited about the new movie. When I first watched the official trailer of the 10th movie I liked it and I really had high expectations about that movie. Eventually, it was as good as the previous movies of the franchise. The plot of the movie was very interesting and mysterious, but not really innovative. The storyline was very well written and most parts were well-explained, however it was similar to the previous movies. The characters were very interesting and well-developed, but none of them was likeable. The casting was really good and their acting was amazing, especially those who played jigsaw's victims (for example, Valentina). The killcount of the movie was very bloody, gory and brutal, just like the previous movies. Gladly, most of the traps were kinda innovative and they were very brutal. Moreover, the duration of the movie was too long and it wasn't as fast-paced as the previous movies. The ending twist was kinda unpredictable, however it wasn't really shocking. Overall, ""Saw X"" was an enjoyable prequel, very intense, bloody and I would definitely recommend it to my friends. Last but not least, we definitely need an 11th movie.",2023-10-20
"I've always been a big fan of the Saw movies. The cool music, plot twists, and the genius of Jon Kramer. This movie takes place between Saw I and II, and it tells the story of Jon Kramer and his pupil Amanda putting a bunch of crooks who ripped Jon off on his cancer treatment through some ""games.""I liked moments of this film a lot, but I felt the final twenty minutes or so the film kind of went away from what made it work so well.But, it was GREAT to see Tobin back as Jigsaw.One big problem I had with the film was that it didn't get to the good music until the final moments and I should add that I saw the plot twist a mile away.Anyhow, there was still some great moments in the movie and it was good to see the old cast back.Not a terrible Saw movie but also not as good as I-VI,If you like SAW _ I recommend this film.",2023-10-04
"Saw V focused a lot on the protagonist's personal story, where we get to know him and his personality better, but this Saw X is even more intimate. We can better understand his frustration. I consider this Saw to be the third best in the saga, behind I and II.Once again in this Saw you hear a huge moral lesson, always containing the extreme violence of custom, in absolute realism.This movie takes place after the first and before the second.The directors have managed to save the franchise, and this film manages to be very surprising for the viewer.The performances were very credible!It's amazing how, after ten movies, they can still give us something so clever.Everything came together perfectly!There's a post-credits scene not to be missed.",2023-10-20
"As John Kramer (Tobin Bell) ""The Jigsaw Killer"" faces his impending death from an inoperable brain tumor, John learns of an experimental cure from a member of his cancer support group, Henry Kessler (Michael Beach), based out of Mexico City as the treatment isn't FDA approved but Henry assures John of its results. John contacts the program's head Cecilia Pederson (Synnove Macody Lund) who arranges for John to join the program. While the procedure is allegedly a success, John soon finds that there was no treatment and he has actually been the victim of a fraud ring targeting dying individuals for their money. With the help of his apprentices Amanda Young (Shawnee Smith) and a police Detective, John captures the members of the fraud ring and forces them to play a game that will determine whether they live or die.Initially intended to be the ninth entry in the Saw series, the film was delayed in development in favor of the standalone entry Spiral from 2021. After Spiral's underperformance, writers Peter Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg decided to go back to the series' roots with this latest entry including the return of characters from the series such as Amanda Young. While Goldfinger and Stolberg's work on the series has been hit and miss (though I liked Spiral more than some did), this is not only the best work they've done for the series but also ranks among the best entries in the series.While being a midquel set between Saw's I and II does lead to some issues you kind of have to just roll with when accounting for the time between segments, Saw X earns a lot of goodwill by being a more human take on John Kramer with the opening act more of a character study of a man dealing with his own impending mortality. While there are occasional leaps such as a ""trap sequence"" in John's mind that feels like a studio note, the character work in the opening half is really strong and gives Bell some great opportunities to show his acting prowess. When the reveal of John's miracle cure is shown to be a scam, it's extremely hard hitting and creates a solid villain in Cecilia Pederson excellently played by Synnove Macody Lund who is effortlessly hate-able in the role. While John is more sympathetic this time around, the movie doesn't frame him as a hero and does address him as a hypocrite and sets this up as a case of ""bad vs. Worse"" but the movie spends time establishing its characters so you become invested in the outcome and it's especially true of Shawnee Smith's Amanda Young who's the best written she's been since the first two entries. The traps on display are as creative as they are sadistic and the gorework is truly to be admired and will have audience members wincing with how creatively nasty they are.I really enjoyed Saw X and definitely rank it with the best entries in the series. I honestly hope they keep making these because I'd love to see what other directions they can take this series from here.",2023-10-07
"I meant to see sooner but I had sleep issues and the previous week I had seen other movies I'm glad I got see Saw X regardless it's so damn good! This hit the spot for me, it's well written, thoroughly entertaining, clever, and well directed some of the other sequels weren't as much. I own all the Saw movies I'll definitely want this one. I'm pretty sure this and Saw III are the only films where Tobin Bell is among the leads he's still impressive at his late age. I didn't expect some of the events which was satisfying for something to have so many connected films they are still fresh, I'd highly recommend this gem to anyone!",2023-10-14
"Far superior than nunber 9 but still overall nonsense. The premise is that this movie takes place between the 1st and 2nd movie but somehow they forgot that Tobin and Shawnee are 20 years older now 🤗 it was hilarious for them to think we'd buy this. Anyway the start of the movie I hve to say was great, I was in to if - a sort of prequel origin story maybe. Then it got stupid. The traps are totally ridiculously elaborate / it wouid take you months to set all this up yet it takes him a day. Plus the traps don't 'mean' anything to the test or person anymore - it's just turtore porn. One girl has to cut her leg off AND the. Suck some Mattie out of the bone - like why? Isn't a leg off enough 😂 then another guy has to cut his own brain out (I'm not making this up) then girl you are supposed to like only has to break her hand and foot. Like what? How is that fair? 😂 plus the ending where jogssw and Amanda walk off into the sunset... babes, do uou realise their still serial killers? Like they are not the hero's.",2023-10-21
"One of the reasons this franchise has been so successful over the years and why I keep coming back to see more, is because of the intricacy of these torture devices. I always get so intrigued and fascinated by how smart some of them are. Unfortunately I can't say the same for this movie. The traps were just not at par with previous movies. Maybe Jigsaw is getting old and running out of ideas.Aside that, I think it was an ok movie. The story was disappointing esp how the victims were chosen. I was hoping for another suspense filled script but this fell flat for me. Overly predictable from beginning to end. You just knew what was going to happen if you've seen most of the other Saw movies. And to my shock, the acting was mediocre, even from Jigsaw.But I did enjoy it, and it's good to see that they are trying to pass the baton to other characters since Jigsaw might not be with us much longer.",2023-10-25
"Have been looking forward to this one since it's announcement last year & have been counting down the days til its release!The Film sees John Kramer, who sick & desperate John travels to Mexico for a risky & experimental medical procedure in hopes of a miracle cure for his cancer! However, he later learns that he & other patients have been duped & that the ""miracle cure"" operation is a scam to defraud the vulnerable! Now, armed with a newfound purpose, John returns to his work, turning the tables on the con artists in his signature visceral way through a series of ingenious and terrifying traps! Will anyone win!?I found the film to be pretty good! It's definitely better than Jigsaw & even Spiral, even though the latter is actually pretty good in itself! The traps & gore here are on point & ace! It's pretty full on stuff so be prepared for that! The story is pretty interesting too & the direction in this is different from the previous Saw films which is good! We get the legendary John Kramer back doing what he does best, so that's pretty great also!My complaints though for this film, were that it dragged too much! Yeah, the pacing was pretty sluggish! At 1 hour & 51 minutes (1 hour & 54 minutes, if you include the mid credits scene), it's overly bloated & the pacing made for frustrating viewing! Particularly, between the traps & action parts! The films set up is pretty slow too & could've been cut down quite a bit to maintain pacing! I also felt the end was a bit loose endish & anti climatic for a Saw Film! Another niggle, is that it didn't feel like a typical classic Saw Film, but that was to be expected from the trailers & story!So yeah, aside from the sluggish & unrapid pacing the earlier Saw Films are known for as well as the over bloated runtime & unclassic Saw feel, it was a good film! The main characters like Amanda Young & even Mark Hoffman were good in this despite the latter being used too sparingly! Hopefully we'll see more of him in the future...! The ending twist was interesting despite being anti climatic! But the gore & traps were ace all the same!Overall, it's a good entry that is better than Jigsaw & Spiral, but lacks the classic Saw feel & set up we're used to! The film is overly long & bloated at 111/114 minutes & has poor pacing which pains me to say! The rapid Saw pacing is lost here! The return of Tobin Bell as Jigsaw is ace & even seeing Amanda Young & Mark Hoffman return was good! The gory traps & action were ace & did make the film! The story despite being different was unique & despite the good twist, the ending was anti climatic & not quite Saw like! But, you'll enjoy this one nonetheless!7/10.",2023-09-29
"I've loved the Saw movies since I was a kid, albeit the 7th one. They have a formula, disturbing creativity, and most importantly an ever expanding story full of twists. This had hardly any of that.It starts off slightly odd, we see John is seeking treatment in Mexico for his cancer- then straight to him torturing somebody. As seen in the trailer, he is betrayed and fooled. I won't spoil anything but I can certainly say that it was the most predictable Saw movie yet. Even Spiral had a somewhat of a twist, and I didn't like that movie. This is basically John tormenting people, most times with no chance of survival. The traps aren't that cool at all, they just become more psychological and personal.I will say that it truly doesn't add to the storyline at all. After seeking for a reason, an explanation, even an Easter egg- nothing. And not to mention, they almost tried moralizing Jigsaws torture porn games even more than ever before. Love the movies but that's exactly why I know that he is a villain. He says he does these things to redeem people and help them enjoy their life but... how the hell can you do that when he makes you handicap yourself?? It's seriously ridiculous in this one. He's a bad guy.All in all it really doesn't serve a purpose. No cool traps, minimal reasoning, vague explanation of John and his plans and his capabilities. Even the mid credit scene was stupid. I really didn't wanna hate on this movie but the first thing that I said aloud was ""that was really stupid."" I just hope that they can make one last great Saw movie with John. This revealed nothing and had a good moment or two. Not a horrible movie but I can't wait to watch the old ones after this.",2023-10-11
"I was a huge Saw fan from the beginning and still am. I went to the conventions, collected props, and met the cast. I have wonderful memories of the time when the series was in full swing.Never did I think I'd see such a beautiful return to the franchise. This is an honest to goodness Saw movie like we used to have. No BS. This is the real deal. They actually pulled it off in this day and age... and it's glorious!I was overcome with feelings of warmth and nostalgia seeing Tobin and Shawnee together again. So much so that I teared up. They haven't missed a beat in all these years, god bless 'em.This movie ranks as one of the best in the series. I can't say too much because I don't want to spoil anything, but the story is engaging and fulfilling. The thing I liked best was the ""behind the scenes"" look that we get between John and Amanda. Much of the film revolves around their interactions together and they don't always agree, we learn.Sure, they were together for all of Saw III too but not like this. That was when wild stuff was going down. This is a more relaxed look at their evolving relationship earlier in the timeline. It even goes as far as giving us glimpses of how John instructs Amanda to set traps up and when. I LOVED this most.The traps were especially brutal but not overly complicated. A little simpler than later installments and this worked well. I always thought that less is more when it comes to traps.I was delighted to hear Charlie Clouser back on the score, and this is a matter of necessity. It wouldn't be a Saw movie without Charlie laying down the atmosphere. Every time, he pumps out a gorgeously haunting score. I still listen to my collection of Saw scores weekly.This is a movie for dedicated fans only. I would hope it's not the last we'll see from the franchise, but if it is, I couldn't ask for a stronger exit to remember it by.If you guys read this, I want to extend a personal, heartfelt, and sincere THANK YOU to Tobin, Shawnee, Kevin Greutert, and the rest of the crew. Saw X was something special. Your effort shined through as bright as the sun. In an era of dead, soulless, corporate-manufactured cinema, a big Saw group hug is what we needed most.",2023-10-17
"The best Saw movie since the original.At first I was very skeptical, since I didn't like Jigsaw too much and Spiral was very disappointing, but Saw ""X"" takes it's glory since the very beggining.The first act is mainly a drama thing but necessary for the main characters developments and sooner than later, the fun really begins and won't ever stop. At this point you've already empathized with John and Amanda 100%, you understand their hatred and why they do what they do, and that the players have to pay for their sins.The design of the traps is not that impressive this time around yet their are still effective.For the record, fans of the first films will love Saw ""X"" as much as I do.",2023-09-28
"Saw doesn't work without John, I think they went too early with his illness as there were a couple of films where you really felt this franchise could end, they seem reluctant to create many new horror icons, so relying on scream and saw is important.This film was amazing, I took my mom who's 70 who likes horror but thought saw was too gory, would never watch it however she saw here the clever writing, the karma and the psychology behind the set ups. The gore was as a result, it eas unnecessary or over the top, she now wants to watch the rest.The story was great, acting was brilliant, was really creative and well put together, genuinely amazed a 10th film could be possibly the best. It had everything and Tobin is a magical actor. Phenomenal.He's imperative in the films even in a small way, his voice is just iconic. I'd not be against a prequel and seeing the making of jigsaw, more of a deep dive.",2023-10-09
"I don't even know where to begin with this so called Saw movie. If you like a lot of drama with your Saw movies then this one is right up your alley!! It's like they forgot what made Saw so great. It was the unique devices, the unique things people had to go through in order to try to survive. I am currently 45 minutes in to the movie and not one person has died yet. Let me repeat, I am 45 minutes in and no one has died yet. Do you ever remember hey Saw movie being like that? What a complete letdown. Just shows you where Hollywood is right now. The last saw movie Spiral was a complete joke and thought it couldn't get any worse than that. They have outdone themselves with this one, the worst in the series!2/10 - The worst one yet.",2023-10-21
"First of all it was great to see a Saw movie with the focus being on John Kramer. He plays off this prequel sequel perfectly and it is easy to imagine the situation as real. Until we start to see the plot begin to unfold. John Kramer is scammed into believing he has had his cancer removed. What are the chances? John Kramer crammed so much into his final days, in this movie we get to see John Kramer as a hero, a family man with values. They sail off into the sunset in this one. The villainous woman explains her motives and moves like some 1960's Batman episode... you know for the viewer... I would of been happier if they would of smeared Amanda's makeup across her face, to make us believe it was the past. Instead we get what we get, which is a much older woman playing a younger woman and it shows. The credit goes to Tobin Bell in this one. The movie is the tenth in the franchise, and it was not bad considering all which we have seen in the past... I just wish it did not have that heroes save the day ending, and had grittier lighting. Besides that.... I would give it a 5/10....",2023-10-02
"I feel like it was a little bit of a mistake to make it so that it took place between 1 and 2. John and Amanda look so much older than they do in the 2nd movie so that doesn't really make much sense. It also takes a bit for the plot to really get going, but eventually it does. Around the middle things start to get better and from that point onward is what you pay for to see a Saw movie. The traps/games were clever for the most part as always and the tension felt real. The plot was illustrated well and Tobin Bell did good in the film. While his methods are controversial and unorthodox, the film did a good job with making you sympathize and understand John Kramer. It really humanized him which was a bit of a welcomed addition! Other than that it was a fair entry for the franchise!",2023-10-16
"A very good (tenth) movie in the franchise, encompassing early compassion, heartful scenes (I so believed it to be true!), gradually descending into madness, though this time a little too personal, clear and out in the open.Because of that openness, the mystery and drama sections are somewhat diluted (unfortunately) and the choices that the ""captives"" have to make lose steam and thrilling mysteriousness.It is still good and enjoyable for fans of the genre and franchise, but I still would have liked it to have more chilling plots and horrifying twists & turns.And I still hope that it won't be the last one and as long as Tobin Bell lives (hopefully a long healthy life), we'd be graced with his trademark mastery and cold-blooded charisma, though in this movie, he showed another side of his personality, the compassionate, righteous one for people who are truly innocent.In the end, I will never get enough of 'Saw' movies and will always watch any new ones with reptile pleasure.Screenplay/storyline/plots: 7.5Development: 8Realism: 8Entertainment: 8.5Acting: 8Filming/photography/cinematography: 8VFX: 8.5Music/score: 8Depth: 7Logic: 6Flow: 8Horror/mystery/thriller: 7.5Ending: 6.5.",2023-10-21
"There's really no way to put this but ... ""huh?"" Was an epically bad movie. There is nothing worth watching in this film. The leap that is made from when John finds out about the scam to the second act is INCREDIBLE.How did he prepare all the traps in such short time?Movies like this really need to stop being made after the first few.There's nothing fresh or interesting about Saw any more. By now this franchise has become nothing more than a game for the writers to one up the previous installment, in terms of ingenuity at the sacrifice of story. It's really sad to see something that was so incredible as the first installment been reduced to this pathetic and ridiculous piece of ""Art"".",2023-10-28
"The original and second films in the ""torture porn"" franchise are the best, the four follow-ups were mixed, the seventh and eighth, Jigsaw, were pretty good, and then the predecessor, Spiral, was absolute rubbish. This tenth ""gorno"" film in the series was a cross between a sequel and a prequel, set between the first and second films, allowing established characters to return and explore more about them, directed by Kevin Greutert (Saw VI, Saw 3D: The Final Chapter). Basically, John Kramer (Tobin Bell), who is suffering from terminal brain cancer, is told that he has only months to live. In the hospital, following his CT scan, he witnesses a custodian (Isan Beomhyun Lee) stealing from a patient. The custodian is seen in a trap where he must break his fingers using a dial to avoid having his eyeballs sucked out by powerful vacuums, but he fails to do so in time. It is revealed this is John's imagination; the custodian sees John at the window and returns the stolen items, and John says to him ""Good choice"". John attends a cancer support meeting, where he meets Henry Kessler (Michael Beach), who claims to have been diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer. John later encounters Henry who is seemingly healthy, he claims to have been cured by an experimental cancer treatment conducted by a group led by Norwegian surgeon Dr. Finn Pederson (Donagh Gordon). Hoping to be cured, John contacts the doctor's daughter, Cecilia Pederson (Synnøve Macody Lund), who refers him to her clinic in Mexico City. John is driven to the clinic by taxi driver Diego (Joshua Okamoto) and meets Cecilia and her team, anaesthesiologist Mateo (Octavio Hinojosa), nurse Valentina (Paulette Hernandez) and Dr. Cortez. John also meets a young woman named Gabriela (Renata Vaca) who claims to have been cured by Cecilia, and another patient, Parker Sears (Steven Brand), who just underwent surgery. John also bonds with a young boy named Carlos (Jorge Briseño) who lives nearby, and he fixes his bike. John goes under for surgery and wakes up to be told by Cecilia that the operation was successful, and he is cancer-free. John stays at the facility to recover and makes the final payment; he has a new lease for life and looks forward to living it. Before he leaves, he purchases a gift for Gabriela. But returning to the clinic, he finds it abandoned. Entering the deserted facility setup, he finds a DVD containing footage of a brain surgery that he momentarily saw on the screen during his ""procedure"", and he recalls hearing and seeing things. Realising everything that has happened, and removing his head bandages, he realises the whole operation was a scam and his cancer was never removed. Deducing ""Dr. Cortez"" was Diego in disguise, John kidnaps and interrogates him. Diego is then placed in a trap where he must remove explosives wired to his arms by cutting through his flesh, which Diego successfully performs. Amanda Young (Shawnee Smith), John's apprentice as the Jigsaw Killer, then kidnaps Cecilia, Mateo, Valentina, and Gabriela. The four wake up in the abandoned clinic, where John and Amanda greet them as the subjects of Jigsaw's latest game. John explains that they have sabotaged lives for financial gain; every scammed person they have targeted has died, and one by one they will be tested to absolve their sins. Valentina is restrained and placed in a trap with a Gigli saw (used by surgeons for bone cutting) in front of her, and another Gigli saw in a box next to her. She is tasked with severing her leg with the flexible wire saw to extract enough bone marrow to suck into a device to release a key and free herself. She is given one minute, and although she successfully removes her leg and starts the sucking, she is unable to escape in time and is decapitated by the wire saw in front of her. John and Amanda leave the room momentarily, with Amanda saying that they should let them die for scamming giving him false hope, but John argues that they deserve a chance of redemption, reminding her how she was tested. When the three remaining victims hear a mobile phone ringing, Cecilia disembowels Valentina's corpse and uses her intestines as a rope to reach the phone. Cecilia makes a call to someone, but Amanda shocks her with a taser and confiscates the phone. Shortly after, Parker breaks into the clinic, claiming he wants his money back. Amanda restrains Parker, John empathises with him and reassures him he will get justice, but only if he watches John's method of ""rehabilitation"" on the scammers. Mateo is next to be tested, he is forced to drill into his own skull and remove a portion of his cerebral tissue (brain) to obtain a key. Although he cuts away enough tissue to dissolve, his one minute is up and he is killed by the heated mask that closes on his face. Parker is disgusted by John and Amanda's methods; he is released from his restraints but reminded of the rule that there must be no guns, but he is tempted to grab his. Gabriela is tested next; she is suspended from shackles around her wrist and ankle and subjected to ionizing radiation, she must use a sledgehammer to break her shackled limbs to escape. She succeeds and John orders Amanda to take her to a hospital. However, before she can, Parker grabs his gun and forces them to free Cecilia. Cecilia kills Gabriela by breaking her neck and reveals she called Parker, who is part of the scam, to free her. She forces John at gunpoint to chain himself in her trap. She hears Carlos outside the building, and having seen them bonding, lets the boy in and chains him up opposite John. They are put into a seesaw-like trap which waterboards them with blood. Parker and Cecilia leave to retrieve the bag of stolen cash from John's control room. However, they unknowingly activate a tripwire and are sealed in the room, while John and Carlos are freed. John reveals Diego revealed was part of the scam, and he tricked Cecilia into luring him to the facility. As Cecilia and Parker realise they have been tricked, deadly chemical gas begins filling the room. The only way to survive is through a ventilation hole large enough for one person's head, and they fight each other to access it. Cecilia stabs Parker to death and puts her head through the hole, but can only watch as John, Amanda, and Carlos leave the facility while she is left imprisoned. John gives Carlos the bag of money. Sometime later, Henry, who is revealed as part of Cecilia's scheme, with a fake scar on his chest, wakes up in a dilapidated bathroom (the same as the first film). There is a trap strapped to his torso, he will be tested by John and his apprentice, Detective Lieutenant Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor), but is unclear if he survived or not. Also starring David Alfano as Doctor, Katie Barberi as Cancer Support Group Leader, Baltimore Beltran as Carlos's Father, and Kerry Ardra as TV Host. Bell gives a great understated performance as the antagonist with the cruel contraptions, and Smith makes a welcome return as his accomplice, as does Billy the puppet. Exploring more of the background of the villain and his diagnosis of cancer is interesting, he is made somewhat more sympathetic, and the people trapped in games of life or death certainly deserve to face the consequences. The story of a cancer cure scam and the elaborate punishment is quite good, the first few scenes with the character backstory work well, as usual the traps are inventive, and there is no shortage of gruesome blood spill. It could have been much more tense, the twists were a little lacking, and it was rather silly at times, I admit at one point I was laughing out loud at how ridiculous and overblown it got (using entrails as a rope lol), but it is one of the better entries, a relatively watchable horror. Okay!",2023-10-12
"Rating: 6.3
Overall, a surprisingly decent Saw movie as it does a good job in being more narrative focused as the story and acting of Tobin Bell helps the audience sympathize with his struggle, and the traps and horror writing was the best it has been since the original Saw movie (though it does spend a bit too much time in the exposition and does have a lot of the same flaws that other Saw movies have).Decent Direction (Uses a more narrative style of direction to tell the story; does a pretty good job at directing the trap scenes as he elicits fear from their grotesque nature; does a decent job in the more interpersonal parts of the movie as the scenes in the exposition are pretty good, but the scenes after the halfway mark are kinda poor; gets a decent amount out of his actors as this was some of the best acting I have seen in a saw movie (though it still is far from being spectacular)), Decent Acting (Good from Tobin Bell (Feels like he knows all the ins and outs of the character as he uses his experience to carry the performance as there are multiple directions to the point that the audience feels sympathetic for John Kramer), Bad from Shawnee Smith (Felt so forced and unnatural; there was no chemistry between her and Bell), Pretty Good from Synnøve Macody Lund (Really showed some dimensions (but did have some hiccups); gets the ability to show off in the scenes that paint her to be a villain), Decent from Steven Brand (Cringey at times (but that was more from the dialogue); holds his own when working off of the other actors), Decent from Renata Vaca, Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast (Just feels like a lot of inexperience and typical Saw-level acting (though it is better than most of its predecessors))), Good Story (Not laid out well but the movie is somewhat fresh in having more of a narrative and the climax being written well (having its signature Saw twist); incorporates many of the traditional Saw elements well and does a good job in having the traps emulate themes in Kramer's treatment; the writing in the exposition was good as it helped paint the backstory well (though was a bit longer than it needed to be)), Decent Screenplay (Did have some bad dialogue but was overall fine and flowed decently (had some allusions to the original movie and does a good job in being very Saw-esque); the horror writing was good as it plays strong into what makes Saw iconic; the symbolism was present as Kramer uses the traps to be metaphors in his experience with Cancer; the foreshadowing was good as it helped lead to the twist in the end), Good Score (Has the signature Saw theme interpolated throughout the movie and helps build tension and anxiety in the horror parts), Bad Cinematography (Felt very amateur and the frame rate felt like something from the 2000s), Pretty Good Sound (Helps with giving the traps life and building tension in the more anxiety-inducing moments), Pretty Good Editing, Good Visual Effects (Especially with how low-budget the movie is, gives the horror moments life and makes them more scary), Pretty Good Production Design (Helped show the grimy nature of the traps and where they are kept hostage), Pretty Good Makeup (Good uses of blood and gore to help give it the signature Saw charm), Plot Structure biggest issue because it spends too much time in the exposition (as it could be cut by 20-30 minutes; after the halfway point the movie does a good in laying out the rest of the plot elements, Pacing was decent (slower in the first half and then a bit quicker in the second (with the final 30 minutes being a good pace to help illicit fear)), Climax was executed pretty well (with the actual twist being displayed very well), Tone was traditional to the Saw franchise (but does play a bit into being a drama)",2023-10-08
"If you haven't witnessed this ten times before (at least), watching a man play god to level up the score, taking the bodies of his prey, removing souls in vicious ways, then press play, and watch what's all been seen before. As the killing and the torture's nothing new, the plotline if there is one's all askew, the acting is quite bad, when the end comes you'll be glad, I can guarantee your eyes will not be glued. But there's one thing that is certain, that's for sure, that the makers will return and make some more, with another awful tale, that will make all scream and wail, within a moment you'll forget, just what you saw.",2023-10-23
"Saw X is an uninspired side story with no relevance to the main plot of the saga. The games are still impressive to watch, creative and with realistic gore, but the way in which they are played is completely different from the typical Saw style. Whereas the gamemaker and his accomplice usually play a backseat role which creates the eerie and unnerving mystique of the game, the director decided to make this a cheesy soap opera with John and Amanda coming in and out of the game room constantly to make hoaky remarks and drag out the drama. A different villain is offered up by the end who puts on their own soap opera with several events that don't make any believable sense and ends in a ridiculous scene in which John and Amanda walk away arm in arm with a young boy as if they were heroes, the villain seemingly surviving and free to go with no clue as to what becomes of that. The Saw movies had been dragging down for years and this culminated in something almost as pitiful as the two previous installments.",2023-10-03
"Hoping for a miraculous cure for his cancer, John Kramer travels to Mexico for a risky and experimental medical procedure, only to discover the entire operation is a scam to defraud the most vulnerable.Armed with a newfound purpose, the infamous serial killer uses deranged and ingenious traps to turn the tables on the con artists......After the tragedy that was Spiral, and that silly voice, no one wanted another Saw film. As far as many were concerned, the franchise ended there, and there would predictably be a reboot/reimagining somewhere down the line.But no, we get Saw X, or Saw 1.5 if you will, as this is lodged somewhere between the first and second entries. And my goodness, have they returned to form here.Yes, there are huge references to the franchise, but gone are the confusing flashbacks and flash forwards that plagued the late entries in the series, so one could see this as a stand-alone film, and enjoy it for what it is, a very good horror film, with so e brutal gore, and a wonderful narrative.Again, Bell is the standout in the film, and unlike Jason, Freddy, Ghostface, and Michael, you can't help but feel empathy for him, he's had his dreams shattered, and he wants his pound of flesh, quite literally.Traps are the order of the day of course, and while there aren't as many as previous entries, they satisfy the gore hound in you, and then some.So after the tenth film in the series, it's a very welcome return to form, the cast are great, the atmosphere is filthy, and it will keep you entertained wether you like the franchise or not.Hopefully we will see another entry soon.",2023-10-03
"I saw Saw X, starring Tobin Bell-The Flash_tv, The Quick and the Dead; Shawnee Smith-Anger Management_tv, Becker_tv; Synnove Macody Lund-Ragnarok_tv, The Girl in the Spider's Web and Steven Brand-Teen Wolf_tv, The Scorpion King.The Saw movies; People either hate them or they like them. I like them and this one takes place between the first and the second movies. Tobin/John Kramer has cancer and hears of a new experimental treatment down in Mexico being performed by Synnove. After Tobin travels down to Mexico he meets Steven, a patient that had the services down on him and he is now doing fine. Tobin agrees to try it and pays them but soon finds out that it's all a scam-Synnove has done it before to other people. Tobin calls Shawnee to help him play his games that teach people lessons. As usual, there are some innovative traps in Tobin's games but remember, he doesn't kill people, he gives them an option to escape. He can't help it if they usually don't. There are a few firsts, such as Tobin/Jigsaw getting to experience one of his games for himself. Another first is that there is a scene right after the end credits start, involving someone playing one of his games-but nothing at the very end.It's rated R for grisly bloody violence, torture, drug use and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 58 minutes.If you like these Saw movies, you should enjoy this one because I think it's the best one since the original.",2023-09-30
Not going to make this a lengthy one.I was really looking forward to this after seeing multiple positive reviews and honestly the trailer had me quite interested.Boy could I not be more disappointed. I've seen it all before. None of the traps were groundbreaking. Id even argue some of them were outright unbeatable... Cutting off your own leg then flushing marrow out of your bone all in under 3 minutes!? Brain surgery in 3 minutes? I mean come on it just felt ridiculous.The ending was tragically bad. It just felt lame and a huge miss. Don't get me started on the post credits. The entire movie is getting some serious hype and I can't see why. I definitely preferred the first 2 movies maybe even the first 4 over this one.,2023-10-23
"All the movies in the Saw franchise are bad to normal if you want to see a story but strong if you want to see gore and horror. This installment was a proper blend of both, the story and the gore/ horror.The story was simple and good, the screenplay is also good, the direction was good and the performances were also good. You can feel the character of Jigsaw. This feeling was definitely missing from last few installments but this installment corrected that mistake.Overall, it is a good installment in once a sinking franchise and will help the franchise to revive both critically and financially.",2023-10-24
"Saw was a low budget movie that delivered something new and disturbing, and I bet the creators never believed in their wildest dreams that would still be making them 20 years later.You could argue that the Saw franchise has had its fair share of milking through the years. But I honestly have at least liked each entry in the saw universe.Then Saw X came out! Would be more of the same? Would it follow the slightly downhill trajectory of some of the other incarnations?Put simply the answer is no!Saw X is brilliant! This is John Kramer's story and he is just so compelling in the role of the evil Jigsaw. But in saw X we get to see a little deeper into his rational. Yes he is evil, of that there is no doubt, but when he is taking revenge on a personal level he is very much at his best.This movie somehow feels more grown up than some of its predecessors. It takes a slower pace than ever before, but it also hits harder when the games begin.It maybe isn't as clever as some of the earlier movies, but it is very well written, brilliantly cast, gory as hell, and simply brilliant to watch.I want more!9/10.",2023-10-10
"Saw X takes us back to before the events of the original. Giving us an origin story of how John Kramer came to be the infamous killer known as Jigsaw. We learn that he was lied to by a group of shady doctors leading him to believe that they removed a tumor which was causing his health to decline rapidly. And this is what brough him to begin his work. The kills are as gruesome as any saw movie before, the acting is quite good. And this movie has Amanda in it as well as Johns sidekick and the chemistry between her and Tobin Bell was great. Lots of tense moments and kept me engaged the whole movie. Arguably the best of the franchise and I loved how they ended it. I give it an 8/10 which is my highest rating for a saw movie since the 2nd.",2023-10-11
"As a Saw fan, this one let me down. Too much story time. Reminded me of a tv series instead of a gory movie. I got bored during the movie and thought there would be more action. Everything was predictable and not really any suspense. Yeah, it was neat to see Jon Cramer and Amanda show their emotions but it wasn't really fun. I honestly think some of the other Saw movies were better. More action! I do think that there will be another movie because Saw X kind of leaves you on a cliff hanger even though you kind of know what is going to happen. I would like to see more action and a thriller instead of drama in the next movie, if there will be one.",2023-10-02
"Saw X is an anamoly for the franchise (and horror sequels in general) in that it greatly improves on its predecessors by focusing on what makes the series work: the character of John Kramer.Helmed by Kevin Gruetert (director of Saw 3D, which we are far better off not discussing at all), Saw X feels like a return to form for the franchise in many ways. Though it doesn't hit the highs of the first few films, it solidifies itself in the upper echelon with a potent mix of traps paired with a surprising amount of character focus.John isn't the only focus here, either. We also get Shawnee Smith back as Amanda, which is always welcome.The film takes its time setting everything up. We spend plenty of time with John as the realization his cancer is getting worse comes over him, and we see his hope rise and fall throughout the film. What the movie does better than any of the others is humanize him. Whether that's a good or bad thing is divisive in the Saw community, but is worth noting.But perfection this is not. It lacks a signature gut-punch twist. That's not to say it's without the familiar ""Hello Zepp"" moment and a reveal, but its twist is more in like with Saw V than anything close to the original.Still, this is the best Saw we've had in almost 15 years. I'll take more of this and a lot of it, please.",2023-10-19
"If Kramer and his team are so good at finding people, how he decided to trust his life and deposit 250k to complete strangers, without running a background check, baffles me... Even a person without his resources and life experience would do that.I know this was forced for the movie's sake, but making the ""feared"" Jigsaw so naive really destroys the original character for me.I used to put Jigsaw at the level of Freddy Kruger and Jason, but after this movie, not anymore.The original premise of ""you have to deserve the life you have"" is completely gone, now it's just meaningless executions.",2023-10-31
"LIKES:The Pacing:
-These movies can often be long, drawn out, and boring depending on the direction, or too fast and trying to stuff a lot of things in one movie.-The tenth movie found a nice medium, which though not perfect, did accomplish that balance of storytelling and torture into one.-Kramer's newest tale really relies to a level on this, and I found myself engaged with the group more than I have been in a while.The Acting:
-Saw may not hold the most class when it comes to the acting, but this group did a great job playing the roles dished out to them.-Each player of the game, alongside the vandals to a degree, hold some level of genuine terror, pain, and emotion that I found quite believable and often well executed.-To start the Macody-Lund was a wonderful character that tied so much together. She might be a little more extreme in her qualities and personality than previous, but in this particular story... it really works.-She delivers an amazing set of vice, class, and strategy and I loved her being that player that had a ""unique"" style of playing that worked to help mix things up a bit.-Smith's return to the role of Amanda was a nice direction, and one that pertained well to the story. This film sees Amanda's transitioning in terms of the tale we know, and I loved the direction both actress and direction/writing took her.-She's got edge, but there is more to her, and Smith really managed to take a rather extreme character and reel her back in to a character with more depth than I imagined this late in the game.-AS for Bell, well, he rocks and still knows how to bring a strong delivery to a role that has been hit by so much time. His voice delivery, the fact he can still convey emotion despite the monotone he does, and the edge, are all there, but some vulnerability that I enjoyed.-Amazing work all around.The Traps
-It's a return to the terror and grandiosity of Saw without going into the cheese fest the last few have been.-The tenth installment has that sinister edge of justice with it, mixed with disturbing traps that are extreme yes, but still quite feasible and classic to the original ones we saw long ago.-Each one of them held a believable amount of prep work, that skin crawling level of shock value that works and tests your merit, which for those who don't like this stuff, really need to shy away.-And to have the characters play much more into the traps, only helps bring them to life even more, the writer and directors telling a story with the traps, rather than just cramming more in for more gore factor.The Edge/Suspense:
-Jigsaw started this a while ago of having a blend of throw away characters and characters you are rooting for to make it through this ordeal.-And in that regards, it adds that bite to the traps, giving you true tests that actually made me wonder who would pass and who would fail in regards to this challenge.-I actually found they mixed things up pretty well too. There was enough diversity and planning to keep things exciting, and not jamming mindless traps in for the heck of it, once more getting back to the roots that made Saw exciting for me in the past.-And all of this again comes back to actually caring about the story and characters over just the kills.The Story:
-Saw's tales have been a mess for a while with all the skips, twists, and plot twists that they threw into the haphazard timeline.-This movie again sort of shed all the trends and complicated telling, and simplified things without dipping quality.-This is a prequel of sorts, and I enjoyed just getting focus on Kramer again, and with it, really diving into the morals of the group that started it all.-No major spins, no accomplice swapping, and no changing the rules, for the most part. Just really focusing on the heart of this series in regards to why our players are being tested and adding a little growth to an already fleshed out character.The Sound and Video Editing:
-The movie requires to capture everything to immerse you into the nightmare, and once more well done.-The sound editing of the movie is solid with clear dialog, those jaw clenching sounds of machines activating, and the music to help tie the terror together.-Visual wise, the filters of the camera go well for almost every aspect of storytelling. The grimy filter gives that layer of ick factor, dirty, dark, dismal and dank to show how horrible it is.-And the camerawork gives you everything you expect, all the details in full view and from the level where carnage is maximized. It might be a bit much for me, but props to the camera and editing to bring it all together.DISLIKES:Annoying placement of Movie:
-For a tenth installment, this film is still on the trend of putting the movie in a nonlinear fashion that is annoying.-Going back to the earlier timeline was smart, but the fact we have to still muddy the timeline with the movie, is a tad annoying for me and may be for others.Missed the Game Element To An Extent:
-The movies that left the marks were the puzzles, traps, tricks and games that made it feel like an adventure/challenge that brought everyone together.-Now the movie once again is missing this element, and though has a the ""game"" nature, is really more of an extended waiting period than anything else.-I'd have liked to see progression and some of that ingenuity to tie everything together, rather than just being chained in the same room like I saw.-The other elements lessen this blow, but still, some of my favorites are still those movies that did that extended tie in element that I loved in these movies that just add that extra marathon element.-In addition some of the traps/tests are a little simplified, but given the venue and the timing, you've only go so many resources compared to others.The Ending:
-It's that same frustrating tone that is annoying for me to leave a movie open for something more to come in order to tell another movie.-Saw X's prequel nature was going to do this regardless, but once more we have a loose end that is opening up for later. Although there is a little more hope in this film compared to the others so I give that extra buffer.-Add in that most of the twists and the ending are predictable when you stop and think during the film and you find that the movie still has a ways to go to escape what the formula has established to really give that final edge.The Graphicness:
-It's not the biggest disliked, but there are times I was a little bit pushed out of my zone and had wished for something a little less graphic or filtered.-But this movie series is about the shock factor, so this serves more as a warning than anything else.The VERDICT:The tenth addition to the Saw library was impressive and to be honest one of the better sequels in a very long time. A much needed win for reviewers like me, the tenth movie returned to the root elements of the franchise and helped bring back the intriguing factors to a dark franchise. The use of modern visuals, combined with a director who understands so much of the fervor of Kramer's legacy made quite a film that had suspense, edge, chill and immersion that I wanted to see this franchise regain. True, the movie is still a graphic torture thriller, that is still missing the game elements, could use to actually not go nuts with the story, and still is trying to find a way to escape the predictable twist nature of the franchise. Still, this late addition accomplished a lot I did not expect them to accomplish what they were able to do in this film. As such, this film is worth the trip to the theater and I encourage everyone who can handle this thriller to give it a shot in the theaters if possible.My scores:Horror/Mystery/Thriller: 8.0 - i.t
Movie overall: 7.0.",2023-09-30
"I have seen the first few movies in the Saw franchise. After a very long break since then, I ventured into the theatre to see Saw X. This episode tells the story of John Kramer/Jigsaw, who is sick and desperate and goes to Mexico for a risky and experimental medical procedure, hoping for a miracle cure for his cancer. He soon realises that the whole thing is a fraud designed to steal money from the most vulnerable people. John places each member of the group into bloody traps for their redemption.Saw X arrives at a time when we have seen a resurgence in the popularity of horror movies. Some of these are Hereditary, Midsommar and X. All of these have been successful with audiences. But Saw X doesn't come anywhere near the quality and sophistication of this new breed of horror. From what I can tell, nothing much has changed from the earliest Saw movies, nor, in my opinion, come close to the cleverness of the original Saw film. Saw X feels tired and uninspired and rehashes the same old formula.The plot of Saw X is convoluted and nonsensical, with the twists and turns feeling contrived and forced. There was a moment when I thought the themes of redemption and forgiveness were going to be explored in a bit more depth than usual. And there was even a hint of questioning the ethical appropriateness of John Kramer's approach to ""rehabilitating"" criminals. But any exploration of these themes was quickly lost amongst the gore and violence. And the tone of the film veers between dark and campy without much rhyme or reason.The acting in Saw X is generally mediocre, with the performers bringing very little depth to their one-dimensional and poorly developed characters. It's hard to care about these individuals because we know so little about them and their backstories. Everything about the film is competently delivered, but it is uninspiring, lacks visual flair or imagination, and is riddled with cliches and cheesiness. I expect diehard fans of the Saw franchise will find the movie relatively effective, but it is hard to understand how, after so many episodes, one could find it as shocking or original as the earlier films.The central philosophical assertion that Saw X tries to explore is that humans have genuine free choice and are responsible for whatever they ""choose"" to do. The assumption that humans are free to choose alternative paths is asserted several times by John Kramer in Saw X. The problem is that the movie deals with this issue in a very simplistic way. The film presents a very black-and-white view of free will, with the victims of Jigsaw's traps being forced to make impossible choices that will often result in the death of themselves or others. This view of free will is not very realistic, and it doesn't take into account the complex factors that influence people's choices in everyday life.The ""exploration"" of redemption is also simplistic. The film suggests that the victims of Jigsaw's traps can only be redeemed if they make the difficult choices that Jigsaw has presented them with. However, this view of redemption is superficial and ignores the fact that people can be redeemed even if they make mistakes.Saw X is a tiresome and frustrating movie. To say I was disappointed would imply I went into the cinema with high expectations. I didn't. And my low expectations were met. So I wasn't really disappointed. I wouldn't recommend Saw X to anyone. If you are a fan of the franchise, you may be interested in seeing it, but I would recommend keeping your expectations low. If you are not a fan, especially of over-the-top blood and gore, I'd suggest avoiding it.",2023-10-09
"Of all the people you had to dupe Jigsaw, Jig-fu@King saw, smh!Jokes aside, this freshest addition to the never-ending series felt different, mainly because of the treatment. For the first time in the series, a SaW movie was crafted as a slow-burn drama rather than a regular, tension-inducing thriller.And if truth be told, I don't know what to make of this transition!On the one hand, this relatively fresh, drama-heavy approach allowed them to dig and scrutinise a more vulnerable state of John Kramer, which had not been done before; on the other hand, the creators had to compromise with the traits this franchise stands for.It significantly misses out on the shock value as well as on the thrills that were envisioned. This wasn't the comeback I had hoped for.",2023-10-20
"I haven't logged in since I last rated a movie (Joker) and couldn't remember my details so had to set up a new account for this but it's justified to save people some bother.I loved the original Saw it was clever, unique and went full circle, I don't care much for the gore but do like the psychological aspect to the Saw movies, I read lots of reviews before going to see this tonight promising it to be much like the original. It was not. It had a promising start, a mediocre twist and it seemed to run out of its own clever torture tricks/rigs. I was bored throughout and my eyes were dropping at some points. I wanted to like it but it got worse and worse and there even seem to be a bit at the end when the credits started to roll that seems just added in there like it was forgotten. Odd that people are reviewing this so highly, it's not scary or entertaining, it's not even clever in terms of the torture rigs. A real anti climax and probably about time they stopped making these.",2023-10-07
"I don't mean to bash on this franchise but this one didn't make me feel how others who have rated this film a 10/10. I'm in the 6's. The kills were.... well kinda weak. I feel like I've seen greater! Now I will add this. Towards the end (SPOILER) when she has her head poking out of the trap for air.... they should have ended it with a pair of two blades that cross motion, chopping her head off and having the blades be as a X then end scene. But they didn't. Can't tell me it isn't a bad idea. Kinda shocked as this director has worked on cobweb which had much more of a twist IMO. Felt like it needed more! I'm sorry...I just think it does.",2023-10-04
"You know the saying, right? F around ... find out - so no pun intended? I reckon it is more like puns - you'll get it, when you watch the movie. A movie that is the tenth in the series, but technically and if you have followed the series .. they do not tend to go chronologically anyway ... so we are thrown back! Which is why you get to see Kramer (Seinfeld fans aside, that is a horror trademark/-name now) ... and someone else.If you saw the trailer you know that another fan favorite is returning. If not I will not spoil anything for you. The cast list is revealing even more though, so do not look it up. Anyway, the movie may be the best one since the first one. And it has quite the long way to go before it really gets going ... but we get a small nugget ... let's say a dream come true (well you know the ... drill! No pun intended).It also has some Easter eggs - and we do know what Kramer means when he says he helps people ... it's all a matter of perspective. The movie also seems to have taken to heart what some critics said about the first movie - about the saw and what it would be able to achieve - also in multiple senses.Kramer has nothing to lose - which makes him quite dangerous. And you can see how and why ... well the other beloved character broke down in later (in this case earlier) installments of the franchise/series. Trying to keep it as vague as possible .. a bonus scene during the credits does hint that we may be getting more Saw ... and the success this had so far ... makes this quite likely! And I am here for it ... especially if they go the direction one of the producers has suggested! When it comes to the twists ... I think it's safe to say ... I SAW them coming ... but I still very much ""enjoyed"" the overall experience (you know how I mean it ... hopefully)",2023-10-28
"Saw X: Saw 1.5 to be accurate seeing as it;s a direct sequel to Saw. John Kramer is in a bad way inoperable brain cancer, just a few months to live, he looks like Lance Henriksen after a night on the bottle. He meets a friend from a cancer support group who is now apparently cured due to the work of a pioneering doctor. Kramer flies to a clinic in Mexico where he undergoes a radical procedure. He soon finds out that he's been conned. Not a good idea to cross Kramer. His apprentice Amanda is back, helping him to abduct the con artists. Some pretty savage torture ensues, Decapitations and an electric chair are about the mildest of gory deaths to be encountered. His traps are truly ingenious, Steampunkish at times. The old factory in which his victims face their terrors provides a perfect backdrop for the nastier narrative to unfold. But nothing is ever simple in the Saw Universe, several plot twists occur and we are faced with surprises. Great performance by Tobin Bell as Kramer and Shawnee Smith impresses as Amanda. The set up for the con is also impressive. This is not a film for the squeamish or fainthearted, really brutal violence is portrayed and much blood is spilled. This is one for hardcore horror heads. Directed & edited by Kevin Greutert, written by Josh Stolberg and Peter Goldfinger. 7.5/10.",2023-10-04
"I can only say one thing about the Saw franchise... Saw X is now one of my favorite sequels or prequels ever made, and it was better than I hoped it would. The movie takes place after the event of Saw 1, where John Kramer goes to Mexico to seek help from doctors, until it was all a lie, and now Jigsaw wants Justice and revenge for those who crossed him. This is a true sequel to Saw 2, and then goes after Saw X.Saw X has the highest ratings for the very first time, and only one of the originals made a little low budgets. Saw 1 is still her best movie of the franchise, but the other sequels of Saw 2 to 7, Jigsaw was not a bad movie to be honest, but expect for ""Spiral: From the Book of Saw"" with Chris Rock, that was a different Saw movie, which was pretty sloppy and campy, but not like Saw X!The Jigsaw traps was pretty well done and they were pretty interesting once you get to know one of them, and one of the traps was my favorite. But Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith on the other hand, they both did a really great job with there roles and they are truly legendary as there main characters from previous Saw films lives on.Saw X, was some sort of anti-hero serial killer's movie I've ever experienced there character's journey and how well the story of John Kramer was very well written. The director of Saw VI and Saw 3D: The Final Chapter: Kevin Greutert, have finally made one of the best Saw franchises in 20 years of the making. And finally... the Saw franchise will live on, and rejoice to the fans who loves... ""SAW""10/10.",2023-09-29
"I won't be going into details about the plot, story, killings, etc... I just wanna say congratulations to everyone involved, production, crew, actors, stunts... You people did an extraordinary job, bringing that small piece of Jigsaw history to life. I am more than curious about your next move.Detective Hofmann I thought you were not in this one, but yet, you appeared at the exact time on the right place.Ps. I'd like to be a part of the franchise, and I wish if the production could give me a chance to write the next one.... :) Saw XI or any other saw spin-off. It would me my honor.........",2023-10-24
"Well the Saw franchise has reached its TENTH entry, which is always an impressive milestone. What's further impressive is that most other franchises that have made it this far have been steadily going since the early 80's... but Saw began in 2004 and made it to double digits in less than two decades! Wow. Saw X is great fun and if it weren't for one grisly daydream John Kramer has in the opening, the first half of the film doesn't even feel like a Saw flick, which makes the ruthless carnage of the second half bite all the harder. Taking place canonically somewhere very early on in the overall story, a cancer ridden John Kramer journeys to Mexico to undergo an experimental treatment carried out by a Swedish specialist, one last ditch effort to eradicate his sickness so that he may continue his... work. Well that Swedish specialist turns out to be an amoral fraudster who never had any intention of healing him and soon she finds out exactly what happens when you get on the Jigsaw killer's bad side. The opening of the film is just so benign, almost pleasant even. Kramer is just this polite old gentleman who doesn't want to die and really earns our sympathy, until the midpoint of the film when we descend into familiar territory and things get typically gruesome once again. Bell is now 81 and it may be an exercise in extreme suspension in disbelief to buy this as taking place so close to the first film in terms of continuity, but the guy does have cancer, which could explain the spectrally geriatric presence. He is quite the actor though and has made Kramer an iconic character, if this is his swan song both in the Saw franchise and in cinema, what a way to go out. The film has some uneven beats and ridiculous plot turns but it's Bell's grave, earnest work, the return of Shawnee Smith as Amanda (with a cute Spock haircut, no less) and that innocuous opening sequence that make this a lot of fun. Oh, and a post credits scene that brings back a franchise mainstay, one of my favourite actors who I was happy to see resurrected, even so briefly.",2023-10-25
"Brief plot: our old friend John Kramer is still sick, but gets word that there is a miracle cure, underground, that can cure his brain cancer. He pays the money, goes there, and manages to find out it was a scam to make bucks off of desperate people. I'm not spoiling anything, as this happens in the first 20 minutes or so.Ok, so first the good. I loved the original Saw movie when it came out, then feel as though they just made too many sequels. A couple were good, but most were 'eh"". Liked Jigsaw, didn't care for Spiral. That being said, Saw X gets back to the original formula....people mess up, wind up in a strange room in a ""trap"", and its up to them to do what they have to do to escape. The original formula and storyline make it fun again, but....
If you saw the original Saw, this is basically an hour and a half or so more of that movie. I wasn't ""bored"" exactly, but.....it was just more of the same......and although it's good they went back to it, it REALLY moved slow. You're just waiting to see when the next trap ""challenge"" will happen. And for whatever reason, the movie feels rushed with little to keep your attention. I am giving it a 5, and maybe that's a bit harsh and I just expected more, but I streamed it on Vudu and would REALLY have been disappointed if I paid 50 bucks at the movies for two tickets and some snacks.",2023-10-31

"Maybe slight spoilers ahead about connection with previous movies.:Just bcuz you show few moments with dying John, trying to get sympathies for him, it wont work as a whole. Theres ZERO connection with first or second part, zero succession and very weak ending. I was hoping for steadily crafted continuation from the ending of the first part , emotional drama in John, emotional fight with Amanda. But nothing comes in this so called finale. I can applaud Tobin Bell for his heroic performance despite being 80 y/o , but Amandas character brings nothing, and this movie doesnt work as Saw X being called like ""part between frist and second instalment"".. its just another Saw with new traps but with zero soul and zero refreshment.. cecillia revealing john kramer is a jigsaw is absolutely non functioning as a twist , billy the doll , john kramer , amanda - all those elements are NOT crafted in a way this part would deserved...
Huge disappointment for me as huge Saw fan.",2023-10-21
"First thirty odd minutes of the film is slower and more painful than the traps, it lacks depth and suspense.. every step is predictable with boring outdated clichés.This do not deserve to wear the tile of ""Saw"".. it's just generic, slow, boring and bad in every way.. it lacks everything the previous movies have, what it lacks the most is the feeling and suspense the other ones give, the dread and psychological menace.The traps themselves are laughable and dull, a mastermind like Jigsaw would never consider using them, they don't instill the fear and horror in the victim like a true Jigsaw trap would.I gave up half way thru the trap after the pipe bombs..don't waste your money or your time with this garbage.",2023-10-20
"A saw movie that does not begin with a trap. An instant let down for many and although unique and creative, maybe not the best idea for this franchise. Tobin Bell gets to really act here but it's more of the feel bad for the bad guy stuff. With that said, It has potential to make you cry through out the elongated first two acts of sappyness. Then we do get some decent traps. The bombs in the arms thing was one of my favorites as it was pretty cringey. The leg thing was also decent. Overall, not too bad with the traps. The eye ball one was short lived and underwhelming but it was just what I expected nonetheless. This movie will sit well with the older crowd that started this journey as the first film was released and have watched them in order upon release since. The younger crowd will want to see it, well, because it's SAW, but they will be bored and not able to sit until the gore. An off kilter SAW film, decent acting, meh twists, and decent gore but more should have been shown as far as violent deaths. I feel the traps could have been more creative. They didn't even have like a stand out trap for everyone to talk about for years to come.",2023-10-07
"This movie was a lot better than others in the franchise - story writers tried to do something different which worked in parts but ultimately fell short in its execution:The traps - as always, the traps deliver the gore and that uncomfortable feeling in your stomach as you watch someone fighting to survive.However, even though Kramer literally whips these traps up in a short space of time to capture the con artists, the traps didn't feel like they were designed for each player. They were nothing special, nothing particularly creative that blew my mind except for the vacuum eyes (which was only used as a ""what if"" moment to fill your gory needs while we watched 20mins worth ofKramer - I loved Tobin Bell taking centre stage but didn't like the writing for the character in this one. You're telling me that someone as intelligent and observant as Kramer got conned by these people? Come on! I know they tried to make him more relatable and desperate but Kramer is a very logical man. He would have known and began to accept that his cancer is incurable and you're telling me he fell for the lies?We already knew John was dying of cancer but he had already turned off his emotions after losing his son... now to see him acting warm, hugging characters and crying with them. This is not Kramer. The subjects come first over any and all emotions.It felt like an attempt to make him an antihero so that the audience sympathises with him which really wasn't needed and... out of character for Kramer who always has his head in the game.Considering this is based between Saw 1 & 2, it felt like watching a completely different character which didn't line up with the rest of the movies.The ""twist"" - saw it coming.To try and make the audience believe that Kramer ""overlooked"" details of his game and then have the twist be that he actually had it together this whole time, it felt really lazy. There was nothing new about it, no clever writing that subverts your expectations which is something that I loved about the original.All in all, it's not terrible but it's not worthy of being compared to some of the better Saw movies, in my opinion.",2023-10-11
"Everything I've ever wanted in a Saw sequel, really the sequel I've been waiting for since 2010. It's amazing to see the franchise in the hands of someone that truly, truly gets it.Tobin Bell is a legend that will be remembered for generations to come, not just by horror genre fans, but by audiences everywhere. His artful performances grab me and make me feel what he feels. Bell is a true thespian and a hard worker in his craft. I truly idolize the work the man puts into every role he takes, no matter the genre, but I especially admire how much he cares about John Kramer. SAW would be nothing without Tobin Bell and his performance as this character. His chemistry with Shawnee Smith is still as real and heartbreaking as it was more than a decade ago. The pair have one of my favorite relationships in cinema, and they still tap into it effortlessly. Shawnee Smith is as amazing as Amanda as ever, and her beauty will never cease to shine. Saw X was definitely a fan same as EVIL DEAD RISE that could ever want and then some, as the greatest horror franchise ever returns with yet another genius concoction of mystery, emotion, and, of course, gory carnage that few movies today even dare try. The traps are gruesome, inventive, and totally squirm-inducing, while Tobin Bell is at his sweetly tender best as John Kramer, delivering a side of the man rarely hinted it in previous films. There are all sorts of Easter eggs and callbacks to the original movie for fans to gobble up, and there's an awesome mid-credit scene. In short: I came, I Saw, it conquered, and I can't wait for what the series holds in store next.Not since ""terrifer 2"" have I been this utterly thrilled for whacked out carnage, and Saw X certainly surpassed all expectations. But to my perspectives this is the same level as EVIL DEAD RISE!! Love my Gore and Torture Films.",2023-09-30
"I'm not going to lie, I was very apprehensive about seeing this one. However, any doubts I had were quickly dashed away once the story was set and the games began. I was glued to the screen and ready for anything this film had to throw at me, body parts and all.It was also refreshing to see a Saw film that actually takes itself relatively seriously. The plotline, the acting, the gory torture scenes, even the direction, were all right in line with the first trilogy. This is the first time in over a decade that I felt like the filmmakers actually cared about presenting a well thought out storyline that included John Kramer (Jigsaw) and Amanda Young.Speaking of the storyline, this is a particularly personal one for the Jigsaw killer. The idea that these people are doing what they're doing makes his psuedo-revenge all the more, for lack of a better word, ""sweet"" to watch. These people deserved the situation they found themselves in and, in true Saw fashion, the chance for redemption. Makes for some compelling moments, especially the moral conversations between John and Amanda and what their purpose is and isn't. Interesting stuff to say the least.The torture scenes in this installment are perfect. After being completely let down by Spiral and Jigsaw in that regard, this was a breath of fresh air. Where Spiral and Jigsaw failed was indeed in the torture sequences. They were too tame and the ideas were too farfetched. Not saying this one isn't as farfetched, there is no way someone cutting their own leg off and not going into shock, but there's a certain quality to it all that makes you forget about how little this would occur in real life and, for me at least, that's all I could ask for.I do have some complaints about the film that made me give it a 4 instead of a 5 out of 5. Either Shawnee Smith has gotten some seriously bad cosmetic work done on her face since the last time I saw her or she has the worst makeup artist in the world. If this is supposed to take place between the first and second installments, then she looks nothing like herself from the film. She is an amazing actress and does fantastically in the role, it was a joy to watch her play Amanda again, but her look just doesn't fit the timeline. I know that people age, but it really did take me out of the film when she's first introduced. It's quite jarring to say the least.My other complaint is the very end of the film. Not the twist itself, because that was brilliant in my opinion. I almost stood up and cheered. No worries, I will not spoil it for you, but there is no resolution for a certain character. We have no idea what happened with them or where they went, the game just kinda ends. They could have done a bit more to tie things up, but the end credit sequence almost makes up for it by showing us a beloved (in a hate you kind of way) character and gives hope for at least one more sequel. After this one, I gotta say I crave more. I would like just one more Saw film to tie up the storyline from Jigsaw. I would buy a ticket and plant my behind in the seat on day one!Overall, way better than I expected. I honestly expected complete garbage, in line with entries 4-9. The trailers made the movie look a lot more artificial than it was, and I'm very satisfied that the film was more like the first three installments than the others. If you're a fan of the Saw series, you will enjoy yourself. Now, I don't think this film is going to win over anybody who didn't enjoy the films in the first place, but if you've seen entries 1-3, it's practically a must watch.4 dismemberments out of 5.",2023-09-29
"We've reached the tenth installment, and, my goodness, who would have thought the Saw series has been around for almost 20 years? It's still all about revenge, and the desperation that drives people to compete for survival remains the centerpiece of the whole movie. Honestly, I have to say this theme is getting a bit repetitive. Even though it's all about gruesome and explicit imprisonments, it vaguely suggests that as soon as someone harms you, it's like any action you take, even if it involves harming them, is somehow justified as revenge and the pursuit of justice. Personally, I strongly oppose such behavior and vigilante justice. What sets the tenth installment apart from the previous ones is that the trailer already gives away the plot twist: why the main character seeks revenge due to a medical scam. I really don't like the idea that if someone cheats you out of money, you go ahead and kill them.",2023-10-20
"It's nice to finally have a Saw movie that comes VERY close to being as good as the original. The traps are great and brutal, and the story is really well written. As an avid fan of the franchise, this is exactly what I wanted and more. But don't view this review as biased just because I'm a big fan of these movies, this is a great film for non- Saw fans too. The gore can be a bit much, but the emotional story beats between John and Amanda are amazing, and help foreshadow her character in Saw 3. The twist is a lot of fun, and is pulled off quite well. I love the massive focus on John Kramer's story in the first half of the movie. Makes everything feel much more grounded and heavy tonally. Aside from some personal gripes with the traps, this is an amazing movie, and is such a promising return to form for the Saw franchise.",2023-10-01
"If you're a huge fan of the saw franchise I can see why this would be a welcomed reception but does little to establish much of a spark to reignite the franchise. A story that focuses on the back story of Tobin Bell as Jigsaw was overdue and much needed but in the end it did not do much to further the need for more saw movies. I'm reminded of the original ""Saw"" which delved into the psychological nature of two people trapped in a room as well as the simplicity of the torture games those captured must engage in and the originality of it. This film starts out strong but then falls into the same trap the rest of the saw franchise did in which character development is shallow and over the top torture contraptions are the focus. Plot developments at times defy logic.",2023-10-03
"Saw is the worst movie i have ever seen. Not only was it not scary, though i admit it had one suspenseful part, it was stupid.The premise on which the movie was written was entirely pointless. This movie not only lacked plot, but it also lacked story and character development. I get the theme that we are supposed to be happier that we are alive, but this movie was a horrible way of showing this. Plus, this movie obviously shows that it is okay to kill another human so that you may live, even if this person did nothing to you. In conclusion, Saw was a horrible, pointless movie, and i recommend that you find a better use for your time than seeing this movie..",2023-10-04
"The 10th entry into the Saw film franchise since a little James Wan directed horror burst onto the scene in 2004, it's incredible to think that for coming on close to two decades on we have been averaging a Saw film every two years, meaning across that time quality has not always been a strong point but thankfully the Kevin Greutert directed Saw X is a decently successful return to form for a property that felt as though it was well and truly out of ideas when the Chris Rock starring Spiral released in 2021.Returning to the directors chair after helming both Saw VI and Saw 3D in the past, as well as handling the editing duties on the original 2004 classic, Greutert knows his way around a Saw feature and his experience shows with Saw X both a much more polished and unnerving entry than the most recent of efforts, as his direct follow on from the original, set in between Saw and Saw II delivers on all the goods that fans will be waiting for with bated breath.Key to the success of Saw X is giving the film an actual plot worth building everything else around and for long-term fans they're going to get a huge kick out of getting more Tobin Bell than they could've ever hoped for, as the 81 year old actor here returns as the infamous engineer/trap master John Kramer (no relation to Cosmo) who after the events of the first film sets off to Mexico in hope of being cured of his terminal cancer, an adventure that leads him down a dark path that eventuates in some of the series most memorable traps yet.Perhaps more slowly paced early on that many would be expecting as we take a nice little sojourn with Kramer to the sunny locales of Mexico (Hollywood Mexican filter absolutely included), Saw X doesn't rush into things here and gives Bell the most material he's had to work with yet in the 10 film series and while not everything in this long-winded early section makes a mark, it at least allows us to enjoy some calm before the storm when the more stereotypical Saw goodness begins to hit, whether you're eyeballs are ready for it or not.Without sounding too macabre it's likely many audience members signed up for Saw X to see some dastardly and terrifying traps/games hog the spotlight and on that front Greutert and his creative team deliver in spades with a collection of scenes and scenarios that are likely to get audiences squirming in their seats and while not quite up to the level of devilishly memorable moments from the first two Saw entries, Saw X can be ranked in the upper echelon of the Saw carnage hall of fame.There's a lot of aspects of Saw X that leave a lot to be desired, including the slightly on the nose script work of screenwriters Pete Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg and the performances of the films supporting cast, including an out of her depth Shawnee Smith as returning fan favourite Amanda Young but overall to consider where we are now from the lows of Spiral and Jigsaw, Saw X is a welcome return to form showing that against all the odds, Saw still has a pulse.Final Say -There's nothing groundbreaking about this 10th Saw instalment but its back to basics approach and lead turn from series stalwart Tobin Bell ensures Saw X is going to be a hit with fans who have been long-suffering over recent times.3 surgery DVDs out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",2023-10-12
"The movie is normal, I liked the beginning, I was waiting for Kramer's identity to be revealed and everything seems to be known about Kramer anyway, but I wanted to know more about him, alas, all this turned out to be just a prelude to development. Yes, I liked the ""psychology"" of the ""engineer"" personality that the beginning of the film hinted at.I liked the final turn, it's like a breath of fresh air.* A woman, whatever she is, would hardly want to harm a child, it's not very convincing.The last two deadly mechanisms, before the finale, are not very realistic, they fit into the logic of the plot, but still, they are strange mechanisms.",2023-10-07
"In Saw X, I praised Bell and Lund's performances, violence, brutality, gore, traps and how they are designed, direction, screenplay, atmosphere, soundtrack, story and its focusing on things more than the victims and the traps that they are put in, dramatic moments, cinematography, and the twist nearly at the end of the movie.Regarding the flaws, what I didn't like is that in the story, there are some confusing elements that make the person a little bit lost in some parts, and not knowing what exactly happened and how it happened. Also, I felt that some story parts were not so logical and could have been presented in a better way.But these flaws won't prevent me from saying that I liked Saw X so much, and I wish that the franchise continue in the future, whether with sequels or prequels. When it comes to the score, I give Saw X 8 out of 10.",2023-10-06

"I've only seen the first two Saw films (and the Spiral 'spin off' film), so I'm definitely not a die hard fan of the franchise. That being said I did enjoy those first two films, but this one just seems a little bit mediocre in comparison.I went into those first two Saw films expecting nothing but gratuitous torture scenes, and while there were plenty, the stories were surprisingly gripping. This film however is much more in line with what I expected from the Saw franchise.Weak story. Bland characters. Cliche writing. An over-reliance on extreme body horror.Now, I must say. The body horror is pretty wild. It's not necessarily my thing, but if that's what you enjoy this film has some properly grim scenes. But it does rely too much on them. The story is pretty empty so if you're looking for a gripping tale this isn't it.There are some positives though. Tobin Bell is pretty good as John Kramer and a return of a franchise favourite is nice.Overall though I was pretty unimpressed. Even if you are a big Saw fan this film adds nothing to the canon of the franchise and is a pretty pointless entry. Maybe one to avoid unfortunately.",2023-10-13
"Saw X, the 10th film in the gory horror franchise, has an impressive Rotten Tomatoes score of 84 percent ""fresh."" This is significantly higher than any other movie in the franchise, with the previous high score being 2004's Saw, which only has a 50 percent freshness rating. The previous high score was from the first film, 2004's Saw, which is now considered a groundbreaking thriller and launched the career of director James Wan, co-writer and co-star Leigh Whannell, and the 10-film franchise. Saw is a franchise that has been a subject of fascination for many years, with its focus on torture pornography and the horror genre. The franchise's success can be attributed to financial greed, but the decision to kill the series' big bad Jigsaw in Saw III left the makers in a trap. The subsequent sequels were flashback-heavy, filling in an increasingly convoluted backstory, making each new Saw film feel more like a daytime soap opera. In 2021, Chris Rock-led Spiral attempted to spin the story off into a detective thriller with a different villain, but it was an embarrassingly junky disaster. Two years later, Jigsaw, also known as John Kramer, returns in Saw X, taking place between the first and second Saw movies. The film starts as a drama, as Kramer deals with his terminal cancer diagnosis. He hears about a radical new treatment, which he finds a new well of hope. However, after the procedure, Kramer discovers it was a cruel scam and vows to teach the fraudsters an unforgettable lesson. The series returns with a clearer plan and stronger dramatic pull, despite the lack of horror in the first half. The mayhem that follows is more magnetic, with Bell playing a more careful and studied actor than his most closely associated role. The traps begin with gnarly, gnarlier traps, with little suspense about the outcome. The film is reminiscent of a juvenile endurance test, similar to Saw films. Some better sequels have managed to embed the traps within a diverting game with deranged twists, but once the trap is set, there's little meat among the blood. Saw X, set in the mid-2000s and featuring a grimy music video aesthetic, aims to appeal to nostalgia for early Saws and attract newer fans. However, it descends into poorly acted silliness and a final twist that requires numerous coincidences. Jigsaw, a horror villain obsessed with his morality, is portrayed as a strange, awkward rhythm, with a suitably abrupt ending. The film's strange, awkward rhythm and abrupt ending make it difficult to stomach, and it's not worth revisiting the horrors of the 2000s. While Saw X might be better than the franchise's lowest lows, there's nothing to justify revisiting the horrors of the 2000s. We've seen enough of them.",2023-09-30
"It's the worst Saw movie I've ever seen.I don't understand how people can give it a good rating or say that it is one of the best in the entire saga. What's happening? Do you know the characters or are they just on the surface? I was about to get up from the room and leave. I was bored out of my mind and the whole movie seems like a joke to me. Nothing makes sense.Saw X presents us with a vulnerable and weak Kramer like none of the previous films. Not even when he was lying on the stretcher in the third film. His personality has nothing to do with what is shown in the first films. Do you really want me to believe that an intelligent and calculating guy like Kramer is going to let himself be carried away by a false hope of being cured of terminal cancer when it is a scam that smells like miles away???? And since when does he start talking directly to his study subjects???? Only on some special occasion. That's not John Kramer.John Kramer would have researched absolutely everything before making a trip to Mexico. He would have 'kidnapped' each and every one of the people participating in the scam and they would have woken up trapped in a game. When they woke up and made some movement their TV would start with Billy or they would have to listen to the cassette tape. The traps would be designed especially for them. And they wouldn't have a conversation with Kramer like in Saw X. It makes me very angry that they continue making films 'for the fans', when it seems that they haven't seen any... Is it too much to investigate the personality of the characters to make something coherent?And what can we say about Amanda... more of the same.It seems like an insult to all his true fans.A -1000/10 for me.",2023-10-12
"Set between the events of Saw and Saw II, this takes John Kramer to Mexico, in hope of getting his cancer cured. With this new hope, he reaches out to a doctor and her team in Mexico, only to have his hopes shattered after realizing them to be fraudsters. You don't get to cheat the Jigsaw himself and escape scot-free. This time it's far too personal yet the man still sticks to his moral code clarifying it isn't retribution. Afterall, he just wants to play a game... game of life perhaps.First things first, it is simply the best entrant to the Saw franchise after the first Saw, even though I have enough soft corner for the 2nd film as well. This time, it's personal ergo, we get to see a lot of John Kramer (Tobin Bell) than Jigsaw as his desperation to find a cure is well established. Barring a short glimpse at the beginning, it's all John Kramer right from the support group to the new doctor in Mexico. Though the pace is slower, those 30 odd minutes do their trick in putting forward his despair.Once the Jigsaw is unleashed, it's the usual ride through the not so innocent victims' inability to follow simple instructions. There is enough blood and body parts to toy around with. The villain characterization is quite generic but serves the purpose within this franchise's genre. The added layer with this being too personal to Jigsaw, works really well in elevating the scenes. On the shortcoming, it is all too one toned when it comes to the fraudsters which is made up for by the franchise's nostalgia and nicely placed twists. I definitely had a lot of fun watching this and it indeed was a paisa vasool entertainer, something this franchise needed badly.",2023-09-28
"Extremely violent but the best part in a while and after so many awful sequels. The first half of the film rocks. Personally, I love the first two episodes and Saw X could easily rise up to my third best. You delve more into Jigsaw's personality, like a character study, more psychological, more humane, more emotional and more sympathizing. Some very unrealistic and shallow moments though, but after a bunch of unnecessary follow-ups, this one could easily stand among the best. And again, lots of loosen flesh, gallons of blood, tons of grisly deaths and of course plenty of traps. A tribute to original story!",2023-09-30
"But thats not saying much, Spiral was awful..this is better, better traps, better story...but again.. thats not saying much, it is still completely relient on main guy being clever by doing these traps, when actually he relies very heavily on a very low level probability of it actually being pulled off.Not as bad as previous ones, but just take the last scene in this, 1000 different scenarios could have happened, each one a fraction off his plan that could have ruined it, something as simple as one of them saying 'you go get the money i'll watch them', which would have been sensible, rather than 'lets both go get the bag of money', and it's all gone down the drain, or how about them torturing them in a different way than the unknown machine that laid before them...he's so clever yet the whole point was he was victim of a scam...and are you meant to root for him? Is he meant to be the good guy?? He got scammed.. and he makes someone dig their own brain out under the false pretence they might live.. then moans about others giving false hope..in all the saws i like how he's mental, thats the whole point, he's a crazy guy who is very clever and thinks he's doing justice.. but i felt they tried to give him a bit of plausible sympathy here, caring about the child and things...",2023-10-27
"John Kramer is enticed into trying a promising cancer cure. However...The original Saw movie was a claustrophobic affair, two men chained in a basement, a ticking clock, and survival possible only by way of sawing your foot off. There was a lesson here: a good concept and great script can result in a compelling and well-crafted film on a very low budget. The production company learned a different lesson: audiences like gory dismemberment.And so here we are at film 10, 10 films in which John ""Jigsaw"" Kramer arranges for assorted individuals who have escaped consequences for their transgressions to, instead, atone by making a choice: mutilate themselves in some graphically unpleasant but thematically valid way, or be timed out and meet their demise in an even more graphically unpleasant way. And, of course, we get that in Saw X.But we get something else. We get quite a lot of Kramer backstory (this is set after he has started as Jigsaw but before his death) and, pleasingly, Tobin Bell gets to do some proper acting. Despite the fact that he has featured throughout the series, his appearances have mostly been overglorified cameos. He's onstage all the way through this one, and he's good.There are the usual puzzlements about marshalling the time, resources and ingenuity to construct the traps, but what the heck - it'a Saw movie!",2023-10-14
"I feel like the ending could have been better. Felt a touch lazy and only thing stopping the 10I've always wanted to see more of John in saw and this gave that side of view. I felt like he knew it was a scam the whole time but then maybe he didn't which would be strange. That was fairly predictable.I'm not sure if they were trying to show a nice side of John by him saving the kid. I was waiting while he was up there on the stage pretending to be in a bad situation and then I was hoping his face would change, something would happen and he'd have the upper hand. I mean the only reason his plan worked was the bad guys left him alive while drowning (I assume he was ready to die) but it wasn't very saw like. I mean what happens if john dies (drowns) then they kill Amanda walk up and then one of them die and one survives. All the work he's put in in the post movies would have gone to waste sort of.NB Most of the kills were awesome and some of the worst stuff you'll see and looked great.",2023-10-03

"This was too much I couldn't watch most of the scenes and I hated the aspect of it where you have to endure endless moralizing coming the front the biggest monsters of all. The whole film is basically torture porn and I don't understand how people can watch it. I felt sad and nauseous and I couldn't watch most of it. If you want to see people punished in the most horrifying way possible for things like being an opiate addict and saying ""this is your room"" this is the film for you... If you were just looking for a normal scary movie with some plot then I really wouldn't recommend this. I feel sick to my stomach and I walked away during 1/2 the movie. Maybe this review will recommend it to some people and I hate to think that but I would have liked more plot, just so much less brutal torture and moralizing about how great brutal torture is at turning people into the best version of themselves.",2023-10-21
"I watched Saw X (2023) in theaters this evening. The storyline unfolds after the events of Saw 1 and focuses on John, who is in the final months of his life, battling cancer. When his friend informs him about a breakthrough cure available abroad, John embarks on a mission to find the people behind this alleged cure. They must be truthful about the cure, or they may have to face John and his unique methods.Directed by Kevin Greutert (Saw VI), the film stars Tobin Bell (The Firm), Shawnee Smith (The Blob), Synnøve Macody Lund (Headhunters), Michael Beach (Soul Food) and Paulette Hernandez (My Demons Never Swore Solitude).Some missions are best left unattempted. Saw X boasts extraordinary kill scenes with impressive gore and challenges that make you question the characters choices, setting a grim tone from the very first chair scene and only escalating from there. However, the film fails when it comes to the storyline and acting. The cancer plot feels inauthentic from the start and ridiculous. Shawnee Smith's portrayal of Amanda is awkward and falls flat in the acting department. The ending twist, while decent, should have been more impactful.In conclusion, Saw X is an average addition to the horror genre with sensational 10/10 kills scenes but a subpar 3.5/10 everything else. I would rate this a 6/10 and recommend seeing it once.",2023-10-14
"Damn, yet another day to milk the cow, lol.Ok , i expected it to be mediocre, but it didn't surpass my expectations.The movie actually started good, and while it was very obvious what was gonna happen, was pretty cool idea. And then it went downhil fast.Traps are one of the most unrealistic ones, esp the first 2. They got the idea from the 3rd movie lol but... at least the operation in the 3rd movie was kinda realistic (creepy i know but thats how you do it). Here.. nope, not even close. I know the franchaise is not known for realistic stuff, but everything should have a line where to stop lol. And the ""ratiation gun"" they used... one of the stupidest things i've ever seen. Nothing about it was right, someone's ""research"" should have been thrown in the garbage.Everything was very predictable, and while you still had the typical twists and surprises, since this is the 10th movie in the series you can guess what will happen, and to an extend - to guess why it happens.Traps were not cool at all. One of the weakest ones in the franchaise for sure.They tried to force your nostalgia with some scenes and elements from the 2nd and 3rd movie, but it.. didn't work. Just tossed random details here and there.Acting - well Tobin is a good actor, and Amanda is finally ok acting-wise, the rest is mediocre. Cinematography is not something impressive, and thats a point down when you consider that the 1st one has actually good cinematography and editing. Unlike all the rest .Overally , 2nd worst after Spiral. But as always , we'll see the next movie nevertheless :D.",2023-10-22
"As a person that is not a fan of many horror movies especially those involving human torture i was not very thrilled about seeing this movie, but i was pleasantly surprised by it! I have not seen all of the saw movies and i didn't remember all of what happened in the first one but i knew enough to understand the significance of some details which made the watching experience fun and interesting. I enjoyed the movie until it started nearing the end, something about the last 30 minutes or so felt unnatural and awkward which took a lot away from the suspense they were going for. Overall a good plot, and good watching experience but ending was a little disappointing.",2023-09-30
"Wow, talk about coming back in style. They really stepped this one up with the gore. I like the Saw movies, the first being my least favourite for it's simplicity but at the same time it is also a genius idea. The amount of movies which have copied the idea of the Saw movies is unbelievable. That shows how popular they are. Saw X did not disappoint and the story was simple but effective. Good acting etc, The only part I found lacked was the end. I will not spoil anything about that but I will say, if you like gore, if you like the Saw movies, then you are going to like this one. There is a scene during the end credits so don't leave your seat too early.",2023-10-06
"Ug, supposedly between Saw I and Saw II, Shawnee Smith filmed the first one 19 years ago. She looks every bit of 19 years older (maybe a little more) in this one.In this one, Jigsaw is the hero! He loves children. He really gets the bad guy who tried to screw him over. Or did he?Someone does not die who should have and it's left open, which is pretty odd for a prequel. Some really dumb stuff in this one. Overall just another SAW movie, I mean, these aren't Shakespeare.And of course a bunch of the things HAVE to happen a certain way for things to fall into place as they did. Any number of things could have not happened and then the plan wouldn't work but in these types of movies, no matter how absurd or out of the way, the people always do what Jigsaw knew they would. Um, okay.",2023-10-30
"John Kramer feels a bit of a plonker after falling for a scam, spending a big chunk of cash on a fake miracle cure for his brain cancer. When he realises that his supposed saviours have made a monkey out of him, he sets about teaching them a lesson, Saw style.Saw X delivers xactly what is xpected, namely xpertly xecuted xplicit gore and xtreme nastiness. The film fails to xplore any new territory, with an unremarkable plot that is merely an xcuse for John Kramer to xecute the con-artists who pretended to cure his cancer, but fans of the franchise's xcessiveness should be more than happy, splattery highlights including the xcision of brain tissue and the xpelling of eyeballs.The running time is unnecessarily long at 1 hour 58 minutes, and neither Tobin Bell nor Shawnee Smith are very convincing as their younger selves (this film takes place somewhere between Saw and Saw 2, but the actors have noticeably aged), but I can say that I was never bored, so I'll still give it a more than reasonable 7/10.By the way, don't leave the cinema too early: there's an xtra scene mid-credits.",2023-09-29
"I love the Saw movies, at least all the ones I've seen. I saw the first three in good timing within that very moment. But I don't think I ever saw the fourth, and I know for certain that I've never seen five through seven. Just never did.I did however see Jigsaw (2017) and Spiral (2021).I say all of this just to let you know my level of involvement with this franchise and my relatability to this newest installment.Does my admitted never seeing five through seven, and probably four as well, make me enjoy this new movie any less than the guy wearing a Saw costume four seats down from me?No, it doesn't.This is one of the best Saw films I've seen.Is it possible to say it's beautiful?Because at times, it actually is.There are gorgeous exterior shots of Mexico.I'm being for real.This is more of a tale of vengeance than of sheer terror, which rest assured there's plenty of enough gore and torture to go around.But the approach here seems fresh and new.People victimizing others at their weakest and most vulnerable.Those are truly the most vile and despicable.John Kramer looks like a superhero by comparison.Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith are spectacular in their roles as always.I seriously thought in the previews, the lady playing Cecilia Pederson was Keri Russell.Turns out it's not.But the actress who did was excellent.This is a perfect Halloween film to see in the theater, even if you haven't seen all nine other films.",2023-10-10
"It's been 19 years since the first Saw film came out. This year, all Saw fans were gifted the sequel we've always longed for, and even more than that. For this film is a masterpiece to me. I cannot think of a single Franchise that has been able to pull something like this off 19 years later. But this year, they did it.Tobin Bell's preformance is nothing short of moving, chilling, and powerful. I genuinely cried, I laughed, and I felt the pain from his expressions and his character's circumstances. Honestly, his character got into my head, John, and that intertwined aspect of him - Jigsaw. What I witnessed was truly masterful acting, so thank you so much Tobin for gifting us this. At 81 years old, you haven't aged a day, and your acting is just as, if not, more impacting than ever before. Of course, there needs to be something said of Shawnee Smith's performance as well. Nothing short of brilliant! Saw X invites the viewers an ever intriguing peek into her character's personality and developments. Also, the raw chemistry between her and Tobin can really be felt, and is part of what really makes this film such a success. It still holds up to the chemistry in their scenes together in the original films. They really do have shared screen presence, so I can't help but think they must feel a connection on a personal level, too. It must have been amazing for them to reconnect after all these years, in a worthy Saw project.I'm still in shock by how amazing this film was to me. It exceeded all expectations. I felt such nostalgia watching this gem. I highly recommend it to all Saw fans. Do not miss it, or it will be a major loss for you. If you haven't seen the Saw films before, definitely watch the first one, and perhaps Saw 2, even 3 if you want although it's not required. If you dig what you're experiencing, then watch Saw X. Even better to watch it in proper chronological order.Applause to everyone that made this film possible. I can't recall having felt this kind of excitement and satisfaction from a film in a franchise before. This film can easily be rated 9 out of 10, I think that would be fairly accurate. However, because I am a fan of the original Saw films, and this one was particularly special for me, I'm giving it a 10 out of 10. My partner feels the same way, in the sense that he thinks this film is something different and much like the original films. He and his buds grew up as major fans of the originals when they were released.In summary, this film is epic on it's own, but it's even better when combining it with the first 3 films for a richer storyline.I highly recommending heading down to the cinema and seeing it that way for the full experience! I especially encourage original Saw fans to not miss this one! It really is different to other Saw films in the franchise later on. This one will definitely give you nostalgia, and I'm sure you will rate it anywhere between 7 out of 10 at lowest, to 10 out of 10. Enjoy, and best wishes!",2023-10-27
"I'm a saw fan since I was a kid and this is my first review ..
For all those years i really wanted to give a 10 out of 10 like a gave Saw 1 but unfortunately I'm not.I don't understand why they wasting time and talking while the game is happing? This is first time I've seen John doing this and explaining his game without a small monitor, i didn't liked it so much
And how did he create all this in Mexico ? In a short period of time ? I'm not being focused enough? Because it's really weird and confusing, and the most ridiculous thing is putting a kid in this kind of Games and when she passed it she get killed.6/10 for me.",2023-10-05
"While I do really enjoy the saw series as a whole, every installment is of varying quality. The fact that the 10th movie in a long running horror franchise is this good is really uncommon.The movie delivers on great acting, great cinematography and style and not to mention some really cool traps with top notch gore! Tobin Bell is great as John Kramer and I really hope they make more saw with him after the success of this movie.My only gripe is that the movie starts a bit slow and that it stumbles a bit at the end. I hoped for a more satisfying conclusion to the story.All in all this was a great saw movie. Stay for the mid credits!",2023-10-06
"Saw X is surprisingly amazing considering this is the 10th installment of the franchise (no Jigsaw traps in outer space unfortunately). It gathered all the best parts of the original trilogy and VI with its creative but raw traps, twists and turns, and simple but deep, moving, character driven story where you will be sympathizing and rooting with the villains who are indeed the film's protagonists. Tobin Bell was always amazing and we can all agree no one could ever top his performance as Jigsaw because he's Jigsaw but this film is his film and brings the character to life more than ever before. Shawnee Smith as Amanda also deserves a round of applause; love her and Bell's onscreen collaboration. Believe it or not, this film has heart and the script was handled with care and respect and is a love letter to diehard Saw fans. Saw X is arguably the best in the franchise but imo it's the best!",2023-09-30
"Saw X is the tenth installment in the Saw Universe, and one of the best. People watch this franchise for it's interesting traps/gore, and this film delivers all that beautifully. The plot here is a little far fetched. It maybe could've also been trimmed a bit for a shorter runtime, but overall that doesn't take away from the sheer quality of Special Effects/ tense moments on display here.The films in this franchise have gone from great, to good, to just bad. (In no set order) Typically as far a sequels go that's the way it always is. I never thought I'd say this, but I'm excited for a possible Saw 11 if this is an indicator of the quality the franchise is gonna continue to go in.",2023-10-08
"Great to see Saw franchise back in theaters and not another spinoff. It's been 13 years since I got to enjoy an actual Saw movie in theaters and I got to say I was not disappointed! Without spoiling anything, make sure to hang around after the credits roll. I remember getting hooked on this franchise in October of 2004 as a college kid, expecting something like the movie Seven going in, but leaving not fully knowing that would become my favorite movie of all time. 19 years later I'm still a Saw junkie! This entry, while still very much a Saw movie, was different, but in a good way. The pacing felt like Saw 3 as did the tone. It had good length and did not feel rushed like some of the unfortunate sequels that between Saw 5-3D. This blew Jigsaw and Spiral out of the water!! It's also a movie that would mostly make sense for a new viewer never having seen a Saw movie but also is still going to please most hardcore fans. There weren't as many rabbit holes as I had hoped for but still some surprises. The twist certainly wasn't the best and was not jaw dropping at all, partly because I saw part of it coming a ways off, but this movie didn't need a twist to be great. Saw X is truly a tribute and story for John Kramer, just as we heard it would be. Violence level is right at the top of what we've seen, but more realistic like the early entries and not over the top cheesy violence like in later sequels. That's about all I can say, so enjoy it!",2023-09-29
"The Saw we know is back babiii!!!Loved the additional character development of John and Amanda. Traps were more gruesome for the most part, and they were well planned and practical. Although there is a cliff hanger, I still expected more from the ending and the post credits scene, but one could assume it was left semi open for more blood; hopefully in the events after The Final Chapter. It would be nice to see future installments that include the apprentices that were shown and forgot about.Huge improvement from Jigsaw and Spiral. Felt like the OGs when necessary. Kevin has displayed his talents for directing and editing in full passion and I'm now a big fan of his. Hats off to the crew, Kevin, Tobin, Shawnee, and (secrets)9/10!",2023-09-29
"My expectations were low, but I have to say that I was surprised by this new Saw film format. The traps are amazing and cruel. The camera shots are great and that yellow color is similar to other old Sav films. Some scenes are unrealistic and absurd, and storytelling is a little off. Some small details could be done better and those things are easly noticeable even on the first watch. I have to say it eas refreshing to see Amanda again but her hair and makeup could look a little better and more like how she looks in part 2. Last two Saw movies were so bad and Im glad they are moving in a good direction but it is still far from being a good movie that Saw fans are seeking for.",2023-09-28
"A Saw movie, where the gory endings starts in at the hour mark, is unprecedented. The script, which picks up after the end of the first Saw (2005), invests a lot of time in setting up the characters, which is worth it as the payoff is almost incredible.This has super gruesome games, with shocking violence that would make you want to shield your eyes. Body parts are screwed and drilled into, skewered.The script is tight. However, I found the last 20-30 minutes a bit unbelievable.At close to two hours mark (with a Marvel like post-credit scene), it is amongst the longest installments in this long running series. It is well made and should please the fans, such as yours truly, who were looking for redemption, after a string of mediocre series outings.Recommended.",2023-10-22
"After the fifth or sixth movie, or even the seventh movie, fans of the Saw franchise have stopped watching these movies because it got too confusing and hard to follow at times with it not having a fully developed plot to it and just being bloody and gory just because it is. The new Saw movie got me interested since it was a prequel sequel taking place after Saw (2004) and before Saw 2 (2005); the movie Saw X (2023) is close to being my favorite film in the Saw franchise other than the first. I liked the fact that we had John Kramer be the main character following him dealing with his cancer, along with seeing more of him and his apprentice Amanda working together.Tobin Bell playing John Kramer again was great, and he is cool seeing him in the role because of how good he is as this character; I liked that we follow him trying to deal with his cancer but also stands by his moral code on giving people chances to live in his traps, since this takes place after the first film. When John Kramer finds out he was tricked into doing this procedure that did nothing to cure his cancer, you can tell how distraught he is about it, and he gets mad in a way, so he kidnaps the people involved with the fake procedure and putting them in traps to torture them but also give them a chance to live or die. I liked seeing Amanda once again played by Shawnee Smith, she was great to see again, and I liked seeing the relationship between John and Amanda who is his apprentice helping him out with his goal.You will want to hate these people involved with this fake medical hospital and procedures and want to see if they can get out of the traps or not; these people have done terrible things swindling sick people, so it makes sense why they would be in these brutal traps. The traps were simple but well done by being brutal and bloody, but there is one trap that was used in some kind of dream sequence that I thought was cool, but wished it were a real trap and not a trap that never happened. There is a character that does something by the end that was not needed, but it leads to a well-planned out reveal by John Kramer that I was not expecting.The ending of the movie was weird because it did not seem like it fitted what kind of movie it was, but it did not bother me that much, and there is a mid-credits scene that was cool to see. Saw X (2023) was a good prequel sequel that I was not expecting to be good; I like that John Kramer played by Tobin Bell was the focus along with Amanda working with him, you could understand John's pain with his illness, and the characters in the traps were unlikable so you can route for Jigsaw, along with the movie looking and feeling like the first movie. I would recommend fans of the Saw franchise to check this entry out, because it goes back to basics of the first film and the movie was not too convoluted to follow; if you liked the first original Saw film, then you will like this.",2023-10-21
"Yes, I'm a fan, and I made my parents and an aunt watch it, and they liked it nearly as much as I did. I loved it obviously. I'm used to saw movies but there are some scenes that I can't get out of my head, and that's a good thing. I almos cried once.It's pretty well done, pacing, light, acting, script, story, camera, directing... traps don't feel overthought and are savage af (one over the top, even for Saw fan), and the way they managed the main characters was good, quite right for the time the story happens, the Kramer philosophy is there and works well, they movie doesn't give more than needed or spoil anything further.The development of Amanda and John was really good, they seem more humane and kinda heroic, smart as always, also seeing them in a Saw movie is both refreshing and nostalgic.For some the ending was predictable and anticlimatic, but for me, there was the climax and it was satisfaying, yet I figured it out five minutes before they explained it, but it's not annoying at all, cause that's not the point but how they got there and what happens next.I'm excited for the next instalement, cause this one was really cool (hoping there gon be another one).It's one of the top three in the franchise. Go watch it.",2023-09-28
"Not only did this movie top all the others (just my personal opinion) on gore and tension alone, but the story while seemingly contrived felt necessary while viewing. We get more context on John's perception of mortality and his ""tests"" than ever before. Instead of listening to him talk about them, we get to see the man in action let alone in his very own game. The performances were top notch all around, and the way this story plays out not only feels fresh but the best direction this franchise has ever taken. I'm not sure how they will make another sequel after this, but, they have always found a way to make it work. I'd recommend watching the first three films first at least to have the best context for this film. It's also an amazing send-off for Kramer himself. 8/10.",2023-10-09
"Refreshing change of pace showing the human side of John for a while, and how even he can succumb to the evils of others without going full metal jacket on them, but calm, collected and above all, calculating.I always love the twists of the Saw movies, the first 2 are my faves, not so much the later ones because they dove into the weirdness too much over the psychological aspects, but this feels like a return to the classics with some evolution thrown in.I like how we see a glimpse of John as a vulnerable human being for a while, and then he comes back as Jigsaw with full vengeance while never faltering from character. Also nice to see Amanda back in action. Nice film, bit slower at the start but worth it to witness the finale.",2023-10-20
Set between parts 1 and 2 Saw 9 (leave out spiral) this is another welcomed addition in the saw franchise which reminded of the earlier saw films in brutal quality.Jigsaw killer is back like we used to know him from the original trilogy.The gore and blood traps are at their best form.If u like torture horror then this is 4 you.This entry is an improvement to the latest films as the franchise declined after part 6.The story was nice the main villain was great and tobin although an old man was again so much convincing.The reasons stated for his actions were fully explained and the ending promises a follow up sequel.All in all it's another solid entry in the franchise and a fresh one if u think that is the 9nth film already (forget about spiral)grade B.,2023-10-11
"Now, first things first. There are a few writing missteps in Saw X which I won't spoil here - one of them happens early on in the film while one happens pretty late into the final act. The latter one, especially, is a pretty big ""what if"", and I'm willing to let it slide because the rest of the film is a total blast. Tobin Bell is in fine form, and this time around, we get a surprising amount of character development for John Kramer. It also helps that Saw X is set between the events of the first and second instalments, and since I knew what transpired before (and after), I was able to connect the dots. Also, as seen in the trailer, Saw X brings back Amanda Young (Shawnee Smith) as Jigsaw's accomplice, in a performance that impressively swings between distressed and psychotic.The focus is somewhat lesser on the traps and the gore, and to some extent, that's also why Saw X is one of the strongest entries in the franchise. Now, there are some interesting traps on display here, and the bloodshed is intense when we get to it, but writers Pete Goldfinger & Josh Stolberg (who also wrote Jigsaw and Spiral) make solid efforts to let the emotions sink in. The victims of Jigsaw's game in Saw X are actually terrible people. This makes their survival from the traps less of a (writing) concern, and we can just sit back and enjoy the violent, gory ride instead. Kevin Greutert, who edited all entries (barring two), and directed some of the latter ones, brings his A-game. He gets to make the best use of Tobin Bell (as Jigsaw) right down to the stoic mannerisms, the voice, and the character's overall moral grayness and judgment. Casting Norwegian actress Synnøve Macody Lund was also a smart move - it makes sense from the perspectives of both storytelling and performance. Some of those nauseating fast cuts also make a return, especially when traps are in progress. Also, I have to say that the opening shots are brilliant.Charlie Clouser's score is significant to the proceedings, and when the iconic theme music started playing in the climactic portion, I got goosebumps. And just when I wondered why one character was left out from the potential victim list, the post-credit scene arrived. It felt good to see a prominent character from the series in that particular scene. While Saw X carries less shock value and gore, it left the franchise fanboy in me wildly satisfied, as it features more Tobin Bell than I could ever ask for. This is, without doubt, a major step up from the previous entries.",2023-10-02
"The return of Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith as John Kramer and Amanda is a standout feature, with Bell's performance being particularly memorable, solidifying his role as the heart of the saga. The film wisely brings back the classic elements that made the series popular, including brutal traps, psychological mind games, and unexpected plot twists.From a technical perspective, the film excels and may be the best-crafted installment in the franchise, with high-quality cinematography, editing, and special effects. The realistic portrayal of violence, especially in the medical-themed traps, adds intensity to the narrative, even though it can be quite graphic at times.Kevin Greutert's exploration of the Jigsaw character, humanizing the killer and turning him into something of an anti-hero, provides a refreshing and intimate perspective on the franchise. The film introduces one of the most compelling villains in the ""Saw"" series, leaving audiences eager for their reckoning. Additionally, the film delivers a highly satisfying conclusion, possibly one of the best endings in the entire franchise.However, the film is not without its drawbacks. The plot twist, while intriguing, is somewhat predictable, and the film's placement between ""Saw"" and ""Saw 2"" reveals that Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith have aged, which may impact the continuity with later entries in the series.Overall, ""Saw X"" successfully pays homage to the franchise's classic elements, offering a technically impressive and engaging installment. While it has its minor shortcomings, its strengths, such as the return of iconic characters and the exploration of Jigsaw's character, make it a commendable addition to the ""Saw"" saga, catering to both long-time fans and newcomers to the series.",2023-10-30
"I loved it, the dark humor was top tier and I laughed throughout the entire thing and they made you feel real hatred for a specific character. I feel Saw fans will love it as well as casual watchers. The hype was well deserved. I went with a group of coworkers and we were engaged the entire time. The humor was subtle but gold, the characters were fun to watch, and the traps were cool this time around. It was so much fun to see John Kramer and older characters again. If you're a Saw fan you'll see little things you love and appreciate and if you're a casual or new fan you'll still be able to follow along with the story and not be lost.",2023-10-04
"John Kramer (Tobin Bell) is suffering from terminal cancer. He spots an orderly stealing from an unconscious patient and considers putting the guy in a trap. He is told about an experimental treatment by Dr. Pederson. In desperation, he finds the doctor's daughter Cecilia Pederson (Synnøve Macody Lund). After supposedly being cured, he discovers that it's all a scam. He sets off for revenge with his apprentice Amanda Young (Shawnee Smith).This movie puts the rooting interest squarely with John Kramer and that is interesting. I am not looking for any of the people to escape his traps. Without the itch to escape, the intensity is somewhat lower. I'm just waiting for these folks to die. There is no police. This is taking place between the original Saw and Saw II. Cecilia is acting too suspiciously. She is more calm than expected and too knowledgeable. Ultimately, this is a good Saw movie and it's great to have its two best characters.",2023-10-12
"Terrible movie , terrible choice of story , terrible back for john , terrible story telling,bad game the worst game ever created in saw series ,that is not a movie that looks like anything related to saw , john never showed his face and talked in the game like this , the movie color and lighting is soo bright and that never been the mood of saw , also a lot of flaws in the story like there are a lot of things that could happen in the end not by john plan and the girl was killed that is not john at all you made the end look like john had it under control but like every thing was going according to his plan and that was Soo weird , because nothing can go perfect to john plan with such a bad story.",2023-10-09
"Okay, so it starts unlike any other SAW movie I've seen and that's not such a bad thing but does make it a little slower than most enthusiasts are likely used to - but it doesn't stay that way. Once things set in place for John to realize what has happened in his life, things immediately turn gory and dark QUICKLY.This one is definitely a bit infuriating though, as well and I say that not wanting to give too many spoilers but rather to be frank about the fact that one of the persons playing the game who should be unalived lives to be the last contender and it really made me scowl.Other than that, you're for sure going to enjoy the shocking, slashing and twisted genius that everyone has associated with 'Jigsaw.'",2023-10-04
"John Kramer (Tobin Bell) is a civil engineer with terminal brain cancer. He is also Jigsaw who rights even the smallest of wrongs by allowing people to ""redeem"" themselves using extraordinary methods. He meets a number of other terminal people at group therapy. Months later he runs into Henry Kessler (Michael Beach) from the group who is cured. He used a technique developed by Dr. Finn Penderson (Donagh Gordon) of Norway. He gives him a web address. The treatment is not sanctioned. His daughter has an opening for him at their Mexican facility. He undergoes the treatment at a remote facility. He travels back to thank the doctor after the treatment and realizes he has been scammed. Wrong guy to scam. Amanda (Shawnee Smith) shows up to help out.The film makes you feel sorry for Jigsaw and makes him the protagonist as he allows others to kill themselves. Blood and guts. Decent Saw film.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",2023-10-26
"Am i the only person here who saw this film for the absolute discombobulated mess that it was?! Both John and Amanda both looked ridiculous in their roles. This should of fit in nicely between 1 and 2 and it just didn't do the franchise any justice. The eyeball trap probably the best trap in the whole film. The fact Hoffman was billed as being in the film and all it turned out to be was just one phone call was a massive insult to the die hard fans such as myself.After Spiral the film makers should of looked at that hard, realised the mistakes that were made and then should of delivered a cinematic masterpiece. But this qas just awful. Genuinely awful.Game Over?Absolutely after this entry.",2023-10-13
This was great 10th entry for the Saw series. Tobin Bell is back as John Kramer and he so excellent in his role. Shawnee Smith was wonderful too. The traps are very good and some are more gruesome than others and there are nice twists.My expectations were pretty high and the movie delivered it pretty very well. Time went so fast while watching this.All the actors do fine job on their roles. I liked the plot very much and John Kramer shows that dont mess with me or you gonna end up in my trap. I hope we get Saw XI in few years. Its interesting to see what direction the series goes from here.,2023-09-30
"Saw X (2023) follows a sick and desperate John who travels to Mexico for a risky and experimental medical procedure in hopes of a miracle cure for his cancer only to discover the entire operation is a scam to defraud the most vulnerable. This was one of my most highly anticipated movies of the year and it really lived up to my expectations! This is one of the best films of the year so far, and one of the best in the Saw franchise.The visuals in this film feel so reminiscent of the earlier entries in the franchise. The cinematography includes a lot of sickly colour palettes which set an eerie and stressful atmosphere. This movie also uses mood lighting to its advantage. The editing is quick and erratic, and the gore is absolutely disgusting which made for a brilliant cinema experience.The sound design is extremely chaotic and adds to the overall unhinged vibe that makes the Saw movies so iconic. I also really love the score in this film, it might be my favourite score in the franchise.The acting is overall very impressive in this film, and I'm so happy to focus lies mainly on John and Amanda. Tobin Bell takes centre stage in Saw X, and gives one of the strongest performances of his career. He turns the villainous character of the Jigsaw killer into a man with humanity and morals, and I often found myself sympathising with him. Also, Shawnee Smith is phenomenal as Amanda, she's a character I've always related to and I am extremely happy to see her back.Lastly, this movie takes a good amount of time to build up the story and characters, and doesn't feel rushed. The pacing is consistent and I enjoyed seeing a more plot and character driven film, it makes for an entertaining and emotionally gripping watch.",2023-10-11
"At long last, we have received the tenth installment of what has been a tremendous franchise so far. And Saw X (2023) not only reaches the same levels as those that have come before it, but even eclipses many of them, including the original for me. Unlike all the others, this one focuses primarily on hitting you in the feels, on touching you deeply in your heart.Starting with a super long exposition (the longest we have ever gotten), we see everything from John Kramer's perspective, right up to the end, which Saw megafans will undoubtedly adore. We get an insight into his experience of suffering from cancer, and his desperation for a cure. As a result, it makes it all the more unspeakably abhorrent when we find out the big twist in the middle of the film. But I will say the lack of gore up until this point & the fact that the exposition lasts for an incredibly prolonged amount of time could be a drag for some of you. Personally I was somehow still thoroughly entertained by the beginning, even though not much was even going on. It was weirdly engaging.When it comes to the gore as a whole, it's brilliant. Not the best of the series, but awesome nonetheless. Valentina's trap was the highlight by a mile for its thrillingly gruesome nature, the people in my theater were so on edge during that scene, myself included! It's a shame that the eye vacuum, which had been so heavily marketed in the build up to release, was considerably underwhelming, partly due to its short runtime but mainly because of, to vaguely put it, its disappointing ending. Another thing I wasn't pleased with was the fact that we had two back-to-back traps where the victim was killed purely because they ran out of time at the last second, even when they had technically done the task that was assigned to them. I cannot understand how the writers didn't realise how repetitive and monotonous it would feel to have two consecutive games end in pretty much the exact same way.But it didn't matter too much, as things really stepped up a notch from there. I won't go into detail anymore about what occurs, but there are two or three more twists from this final act, and one or two of which will horrify you. Remember when I said this one gets you right in the feels? This is where the most heartbreaking moment lies, for a twist that even Kramer himself doesn't see coming happens. And whilst tears may not have escaped my eyelids as I watched this unfold, they were damn near close. It's an unbelievable scene executed masterfully by Kevin Greutert, who has yet again pushed the boundaries for what this horror franchise can become, nearly two decades on fron its introduction into this world.So, overall, it's a fantastic return to greatness after the two substandard flops we've had in recent years. With his uniquely modern approach, Kevin Greutert has brought the Saw franchise right back to the mighty heights where it so belongs.",2023-10-05
"Maybe, but that's like picking your favorite turd from the bowl.Let's start with some of the things I liked.No obnoxious flashback sequences that break the film's momentum and confuses the audience. Some previous sequels used that at a comical frequency.Some variety in shooting locations. Previous Saw movies were contained almost exclusively to very bland looking abandoned warehouses, so it's nice to get multiple scenes outdoors as a change of pace. Even if it is only very briefly at the beginning.The slow burn. This movie is not in a rush to get to the gore. I quite enjoyed the buildup as we followed Jigsaw and his cancer diagnosis. This movie actually attempts to be a movie, unlike some of the worst Saw sequels, which are just compilations of people dying in the most horrific ways surrounded by a bare bones plot.Things is disliked:Shawnee Smith's haircut, my god what a tragedy. Whoever did hair and makeup must have had a personal vendetta against this woman. Maybe it was someone who is still mad that Becker only got 6 seasons.Cliches and poor writing, such as when Jigsaw is about to drown in blood when he is inexplicably saved by the impatience of the antagonists (is this the right word to use?) when they retrieve the money.These scammers use their real names when they do the scamming, making it incredibly easy for Jigsaw and Amanda to track them down.A human being would pass out long before being able to saw their own leg off or cut out a piece of their brain.This is a bad movie, but far from the worst Saw sequel.",2023-10-23
"I'm a big fan of Saw franchise (except the trash can titled ""Spiral""). But this one is a clear money grab! No one seemed to show the least bit of care of creating a quality movie. Rather, they just grabbed a few Saw signature elements (quick jittery camera movements, grungy color grading, mechanical gadgets with industrial sound fx...) but that's about it. They didn't even pay least attention to making actors look younger than the first installment since it's a prequel. In contrary, they look at least 10 years older (which is the fact). Even the iconic Hello Zepp theme is not presented in place!Story is as predictable, flat, and mediocre as it can get! Acting is average to bad. Let's squeeze the franchise even more, a few extra grands won't hurt anyone but the viewers, and who caresOne thing I liked about this movie is that it helped me sleep in a terribly insomnious night (for real)",2023-10-23
"I think Saw X might be my favorite Saw film thus far. I loved having Tobin and Shawnee back at the forefront and it just left me wanting MORE, however we can get it! Very well presented story and a deeper dive into the characters of John and Amanda and the history of their dynamic. I honestly have very few gripes about it and the credits scene is *chefs kiss* for true Saw fans. I really felt like it took Saw back to it's roots...Gory and gut-wrenching, but not overly so, and it still has a story! I can't say enough good things about it and honestly I can only hope that we get one or two more movies still.",2023-09-29
"Now, I am much more a thriller than a gore kind of person.Bit the saw series doesn't disappoint for the most part to be compelling and a good story. The spiral offshoot with Chris Rock was probably a low point mainly because it felt too Chris rock cliche, rather than the movies where he actually plays a part. But even then:..the movie did have basic good going for it.BUT.... Saw X is really good. I was worried with the movie taking place out of country. Like it was a low budget version. But I was wrong. And happy to be wrong.The movie holds to all the basic principles of the series without fail. It addresses the cancer part marvelously. Because I thought they had painted themselves in a corner when they gave him cancer in a prior moviesThe surprise ending was great. As well as the post credit.My only gripe is the most evil person seemed to get away with no real ""game"" because all she had to do was kill...which she already does easily before. So there is no real test so hopefully this will be covered in a future movie. As it's a huge frustration that she got away with it. Especially since people far less than her in the evil category got the worst trials. If they had made her test it consequence more rigorous or outcome known...it would have been a 9 out of 10.",2023-10-26
"I'm not going to sugarcoat this review, but rather let you know that aside from Saw, Saw 2, and Jigsaw, none of the other films have impressed me at all. In fact, this franchise is trash more often than not in my opinion. For that reason alone, I had no faith in Saw X, but because of very positive word of mouth, I decided to give it a shot. Colour me surprised, because even though I do have a soft spot for the original Saw film, I think this may just be the best one yet. The fact that it takes its time to tell a solid story definitely helped, but that's also what this franchise has lacked. Here's why, if you've seen the Saw films, I recommend checking this one out.Saw X takes place after the first film, to really put into context certain things the rest of the franchise has hinted at. John Kramer (Tobin Bell) is on the verge of death due to his brain cancer, so he ventures to Mexico to take a chance and be experimented on in hopes of survival. This facility being not what it seems, sends Kramer on a personal revenge mission. Creating some of the most gruesome and hard-to-watch traps in the franchise. His storyline here is what had me thoroughly enjoying the film. Not only is he doing this to bad people, but I genuinely thought that most of these people did absolutely unforgivable things.I will warn viewers that if you're a queasy person when it comes to violence and gore, to stay away from this one. Yes, there is a lot more story and human drama going on, but when the film reaches the traps portion, even I almost looked away from the screen. Props to the practical effects and makeup artists here because everything looked, sounded, and felt very real. With the premise playing out as it does, this film feels isolated from the rest of the franchise in the best ways. Saw fans get what they came for, but I was invested in this twisted man's story as well.Saw X is a film that stands on its own, as I said, but I also can't see them ever being able to top it. I really hope this is the end of the franchise, because this film solidified (for me) that Tobin Bell is the heartbeat these films need, but in the main timeline, he hasn't been around for many films. If they choose to continue, I actually hope they go the route of legacy sequels these days and just make something new up, ignoring what came after the first film. It's by no means a masterpiece, but Saw X truly does make most of the other films in the franchise look even worse. Now playing in theatres and available on-demand, if you're up for some strong gore and a solid story, I thoroughly recommend it.",2023-10-25
"Just finished watching the tenth installment in the Saw Franchise and the direct sequel to the original Saw, Saw X (2023)... It's a really well done Saw film with a simple plot and of course twists... There are gory moments as usual in a Saw film but not that much in this one... I wouldn't say it's the least gory Saw film but it's definitely more extreme than Spiral... Overall it's a great film... So awesome to see Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith back as John Kramer and Amanda... Love to hear the Jigsaw theme again... They even brought back the old Lionsgate logo just to open the film... It's up there with Saw, Saw II, Saw III and Jigsaw for me... 10 out of 10 stars...",2023-10-20
"Of the two X movies I've seen in as many months, this one is X-times the other. And no, I'm not referring to the sexy kind.Unbelievably two franchises hit the ten-spot this year: Saw and Fast & Furious. Ironically, this one was far less torturous to get through.And speaking of which, how on Earth did they manage to get through ten of these to finally make the arguably best one? To be fair, I'd still count the original as the best, but only because of its originality, classic-status, for sparking an entirely new subgenre of horror all on its own and for setting the rules in motion. It would almost be a tie, though since 2004's far from perfect.Saw X takes place between Saw I and II, though you wouldn't really know it with how much older some of the actors are today. John ""Jigsaw"" Kramer may finally get a cure to his brain cancer with experimental treatments south of the border. But, will the treatment match the price and if not, will John want to play some new games?Honestly, I'd hate to spoil all the wonderful surprises in this one. There are literally one after another and so much so, even after awhile you can totally see where this is going. Not a complaint. Any fan of the series will relish in how much this progressively gets better. And boy, was I giddy and having an incredible time with each new reveal.I seriously can't remember even liking a Saw movie since IV and that was five movies and 16 years ago. And the most recent chapter, 2021's Spiral was absolutely the worst in the franchise. Self-proclaimed Saw-fan Chris Rock literally didn't know what movie he was in. It barely worked for him in Lethal Weapon 4, but not in a Book of Saw.And yet, I had high hopes for this one to get the series back on track. Thankfully, it truly delivered. It was well made, far less cuts/edits - a franchise staple, but grew old, well-acted, Jigsaw was front and center - where he belongs and its place in the timeline is perfect. NOW, you can watch Saw I, Saw X, Saw II and Saw III and end the series there. Sure, you can throw in Saw IV, which was not terrible, but those first four chronological movies are the life and times of Jigsaw. Without him in present day, the films wander aimlessly and very soap opery.Hard to recommend this to anyone BUT a Saw fan, but if you know the background, maybe seen the first two at least, you'll fit right in. Weird, and as always the case, you pick your monster to root for. Shouldn't be that way, but I didn't make the rules.And hopefully, I'll never have to play the game.***Final Thoughts: All Saw chapters ranked...and keep in mind I really only love/like the first 5 listed below and they get monumentally WORSE from 6 on with Spiral being an abomination:1. Saw
2. Saw X
3. Saw II
4. Saw III
5. Saw IV
6. Saw VI

8. Saw V

"I watched all of the movies of Jigsaw and finally I loved return of the John. After a bad one (Spiral) this movie is the true nature of the Jigsaw. Betrayal and revenge are what you felt and of course twist in the end.I loved characters and the environment of the film. I got what all I expect before the film. Jigsaw music, iconic words, twists, mind games, betrayal and the inevitable end. These are why we watch Jigsaw.On the other hand I did not expect the another work from them but they gave the message of Jigsaw 11 in the end. I wonder the another work from Jigsaw. I hope nothing bad happen in this process. Good job!",2023-10-30
"After i watched it i thought that i liked it but after couple days i realized that it was probably worst one out of all Saw movies. The traps were bit meh in my opinion, nothing special. I think it was also bit predictable, i was pretty sure that John wouldn't heal just like that, something bad has to happen. I guess i set my expectations too high. I did like the fact that in this movie one of the victims was also a bad guy and someone turned against John, it is possible to win John. Earlier it has felt like John is so smart that it's not possible to ""win"" him. I love John but it was nice to see someone fighting against him. I don't remember all movies that well so i don't remember if in earlier movies someone tried to fight against John. Overall 6/10.",2023-10-09
"SAW X (2023) :
Movie Review -Kevin Greutert, who edited the best of the Saw franchise movies such as Saw (2004), Saw II (2005), and Saw III (2006), serves as director for the third time with SAW X. He did Saw VI (2009) and Saw 3D (2010) and missed a few things that define the franchise, but this time, he is in a safe zone. In Jigsaw's words, ""He won the game"". Kevin's SAW 10 is the direct sequel to the first film and a prequel to the second one. There isn't anything complicated about the timeline, as you can enjoy this one without any research. The film sets a plot in the least complicated way to provide you with a worthwhile experience with whatever you liked about the Jigsaw or Saw franchise. The 10th film isn't great enough to be called the best in the franchise, but good enough to be called one of the most scary and enjoyable Saw flicks.The film is set a few months after the events of Saw I, as we meet John Kramer (Tobin Bell), who is dying of cancer. His jigsaw games are going well, but the fear of death is becoming frustrating for him. He learns about some impossible treatment from one of his friends and sets out to Mexico to check. He sees doctor Cecilia (Synnøve Macody Lund), who assures him that things might be okay after the operation. After the surgery, John realises that the entire operation is a fraudulent scheme targeting vulnerable individuals to cash in on their hopes. He then kicks off on a journey of revenge and justice for the people who have been victimised by Cecilia and her gang and brings them to his deadhouse to play the game of jigsaw's trap.The Saw series has been weak in the storyline right from the 5th onwards. The casual ideas and narratives became quite boring because we kept seeing them again and again. Well, SAW 10 is a nice break in that sense. More than other people, this is Kramer's personal revenge, and that too when he's feeling helpless and defeated by himself. Yes, some flaws are there, and I was expecting them anyway. Cecilia's comeback was too mediocre, and from the way Kramer surrendered himself, one can easily guess that it's not going to end that way. That twist can be sensed much earlier than when it takes place, but be assured, you'll have enough suspense even after knowing it. ""How did he know about you?""-is the real moment of the film, and that's the X factor Jigsaw I'm talking about. There were a few slip-ups here and there, and I forgave them all for the climax.One good thing about Saw is that Tobin Bell is not typical here. I was getting bored with his portrayal in the 5th film because he hardly had any variations to offer. Now this one has fulfilled my wish. Tobin's portrayal of a distressed man is really nice. His weak eyes, miserable expression, and low voice tone in the conversations make his efforts visible. Shawnee Smith's Amanda Young has a look that's lovable. Everything else remains the same. Cecilia's character is poorly written if I have to consider the villain who 'beat' Jigsaw, aka John Kramer, but Synnøve Macody Lund has really lifted it above it's limited potential in some scenes. Michael Beach, Renata Vaca, Steven Brand, Octavio Hinojosa, Joshua Okamoto, and Paulette Hernandez get some go-go scenes to deliver so-so performances.I remember watching those early films of the Saw franchise in my college days and I tell you, I was stunned by the brutality of the visuals. Some girls ran out of the cinema hall because they didn't have the nerves to watch all the blood and kill stuff, which was so intense and raw. Saw X too has similar segments, with one or two getting better with atmospheric brilliance in the auditorium. I am not sure whether that intestines scene was censored or cut down by the editor, but I'd have given an extra penny to see it, especially the moment when it comes. The other Saw's trademarks, such as hammer, blood, brain, scalp, femur, rays, balance, and bla bla, are there to keep the franchise's value alive. The cinematography is fine, and so is the sound design. It's almost a two-hour film, which I thought would bore me for half an hour, but the editor was kind enough to take care of that. Two hours passed, and I didn't even realise it. Thanks once again, Kevin Greutert, the editor, not the director. Finally, a standard Saw film by Greutert! It was long overdue and finally came now. We had to go through a pandemic for that. Jokes apart, Kevin has given me that old Saw back. Now, honestly, it's been too much Saw content already; it has to stop someday. I'll be happy if they stop after a good film so that one can at least remember a fulfilling ending instead of some mediocre films in the past. Saw X could be that ""Good Film""-indirectly or directly. Having said that, it still has plenty to offer; it's just how much you have seen and what else you want. Make your choice! Go and meet the Jigsaw killer one more time.RATING - 6/10*",2023-10-02
"John Kramer meets Denzel from Man on Fire... literally. Until this movie, Jigsaw had tortured and forced suicide and harm upon ""victims"" he identified as predators because of the harm they had done to other people but in this movie, let's just say this time it is personal. Jigsaw introduces an all new array of torture devices, plenty of blood and gore and though the film focuses much more on him as a patient with cancer, it entails everything you need including a plot twist no one would ever guess including M. Night Shymalan. The last time he managed to surprise me to this extent, he was laying on the floor in an abandoned warehouse restroom pretending to be dead holding a revolver. Great acting, dialogue, and the detective in you will seriously enjoy piecing the film together in the time limit before the game is over.",2023-10-03
"The 10th instalment in the (in)famous Saw franchise, Saw X attempts to take the series back to its original roots by focusing on the narrative aspects instead of revelling in stomach-churning extremity and proves to be the most plot-focused & character-driven entry amongst all sequels. Led by an impressive showcase from Tobin Bell, the film delivers all the expected goods & then some.Directed by Kevin Greutert (Saw VI & Saw 3D), the story takes place between the events of Saw & Saw II and finds John Kramer exacting retribution against those who wronged him. Greutert is patient in his direction, exercising restraint while setting up the premise but he doesn't hold back once the games are underway. Apart from making it personal for Jigsaw, there is also an effort to humanise him which doesn't work.The film does well to create intrigue & interest, the storytelling is neat for the most part, and the death traps are downright unsparing. It is only during the last act that the story stumbles with a needless twist but the ending is still somewhat satisfying. Tobin Bell returns to his signature role with new dimensions to explore and makes it look like he never left. His performance is his finest in the saga so far and he's brilliantly supported by Shawnee Smith.Overall, Saw X is a competently crafted, skilfully told & emotionally involving follow-up chapter that fares a lot better than any & every sequel in the saga so far and ranks amongst the better surprises of the year too. The film could've done without the unneeded twist nor there was any incentive to humanise the Jigsaw Killer, for the story had enough flesh to make us side with his devious revenge plan. All in all, a much welcome entry in a series that's mainly notorious for its violence & gore.",2023-10-22
"The real question here is... is this a good Saw movie?I might have to go watch it again but I don't really want to, which is a bad sign. Did I like the movie on my first viewing? Not really but that could be to do with I was not expecting the first half to be like that, you'll understand when you see it.I got extremely bored. The 'Saw' parts were really 'SAWy' which means gore and blood splatter and crazy inventions that killed people, but other than that the movie was very boring and maybe I'll enjoy it more a second time because I know what I'm going to sit through, idk only time will tell.All in all it's not a horrible movie and not a bad saw movie just a really, really unnecessary one.",2023-09-28
"6.2/10Let's play a movie. The rules are simple. Don't talk during the film, and put your phone away. Watch, or leave... The choice is yours.Definitely not a film to film to go into expecting to be scared, but you'll definitely be horrified, unless you're a psychopath. There's a lot more disturbing, and unsettling content in this one than I can remember from all the others. One game had me really unsettled, and another had me on the brink, but I stuck through it.The story is a lot more personal with getting more clarity from John's perspective of things than it is from the victims. I like how conniving it tries to be with the ""victims"" side, and realizing that people only beg for mercy when their life is on the line.The acting is far from perfect, and lacks full commitment for me. It feels almost nonchalant at times with how little pain the actors are ""experiencing"" despite the fact they're digging into their skin with sharp tools, or inflicting other forms of torture on themselves.The score worked really well, especially when motions were being made and the pluck of the string or key is in sync. I didn't fully pay attention throughout to it, but it caught my ear a few times.Overall, my conclusion is that it's worth seeing. Whether or not in theatres is something I would still need to debate. It's a chaotic, and calm gore fest. Acting is okay, but the story is good. The sounds add to the terror for most of it.That's all for now. Thank you for taking the time to read my review. See comments for synopsis. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!",2023-10-14
"Every saw movie I've seen has been a fun watch but nothing that good from a technical standpoint. So when I saw that the reviews for this movie were generally very good, I had to watch. Now that I have seen all the bloody goodness it has to offer, I can recommend this to ANY horror fan.The plot is centered around John Kramer (Jigsaw) finding a new experimental cure-all for his cancer. I won't say anymore because the twists in this one are actually pretty fun and exciting. However, it's not just dumb-horror fun, it's actually good for a regular movie. It's paced pretty well, the acting is actually soli, and you end up invested in the actual story. Think about that. You end up invested in the story of a SAW movie. Rare, I know.Now, let's talk about the kills. They are very bloody and VERY messed up. My friend and I had multiple jaw-dropping moments and were gagging from some of the gorey traps. Don't be fooled if you are watching and about 30 minutes through there has been only one trap - trust me they come.The only thing that takes it down a peg would be maybe some of the plot holes. I won't get into them because it's spoiler territory, but they are just common holes that your mind will probably skim over as soon as you think about it. I mean who cares, it's a saw movie. The other thing, I wish like 10-15 minutes was taken off. In the last act I felt a little impatient at times, wanting the story to close up. However, it does in a very exciting fashion.I would rate this a 8/10 for horror movies and a very solid 7 for all movies. Just be warned, I told my girlfriend about one of the traps and she nearly threw up. So, watch with your own caution.",2023-10-05
"Kramer's (Tobin Bell) notorious rough justice and hellish contraptions return for a tenth Saw instalment, with a reframed examination of Jigsaw's moral code, tempting moments of conflicted empathy with Bell's infamous character. Some may say the franchise is hackneyed, but the hellbent revenge angle and refreshing direction of this installment proves otherwise. This film is not just brutal, it's smart too, with a genuine plot and dialogue to boot.Kramer's terminal brain cancer is an enclosing trap of itself that has ensnared him, and he has only months left to act. Cancer doesn't discriminate, it strikes, and malignancy saps the life from the human host whether intervention happens or not, but acting sooner is advisable as the stages march on and one's life expectancy drops in rapid proportionality. It is no surprise that those who struggle with cancer are often said to be fighting a battle for their survivability.Perhaps, then, it is a fitting allegorical symbol for the indiscriminate nature of Saw X's ingeniously themed traps and Kramer's notion of justice and second chances, here in particular from the angle of his unease as a desperate cancer patient. Not to mention the redemption for those who fight for their lives, the survival instinct, against stoically indifferent forces closing in. Kramer's proclaimed personal separation from the effects of his machinations is a brilliantly twisted notion about an omnipresent karmic force acting consequentially; ""you have no choice but to play the game"". His ethical thought experiments are made real, and here more brutally and viscerally than almost ever; ""...what I have in store for you is very real"". The clinical exposure of the less savoury parts of human nature comes in full force. Kramer probably saw the philosophical trolley problem and thought, ""why not make that a reality? That would be interesting.""Set between the first and second films in 2001, it is here we see for the first time how, on death's door, Kramer's survival instincts of his own kick in and the effect this has. It would be almost unthinkable that the mastermind himself is beholden to the instincts he's long preyed upon , but here we see that, unmasked, he is as human as anybody else, however briefly. Subject to the force majeure of nature's vice, even he is not above that, and he cannot play God forever.Where the film suffered was, in part, its lack of enduring mystery. Kramer is the unmasked, bona fide, cold-blooded Jigsaw, that's well-known by now. But because of that there's less room for the imagination to participate and fill in the blanks. Fortunately, imaginative plot twists do keep things suspenseful. Yet that absence of deep and pervasive mystery and anonymity is lingeringly felt throughout. Kramer is perhaps too much of a known entity; yet in finally knowing him we can (at least somewhat) explore the inner world of one of horror's most enigmatic characters.Synnøve Macody Lund as Cecilia Pederson brings a callous and vindictive intellectual force to compete with Kramer. Her narration during various scenes adds an interesting medical perspective that otherwise simply wouldn't be there. Her character brings textural enrichment to the Saw formula where otherwise we'd rely on Kramer alone to solemnly explain his machines. Steven Brand as an expressive Parker Sears excels. Shawnee Smith as Amanda Young was a throwback that cramped Kramer's style a bit and made her seem like a bit of a lackey henchwoman accomplice. Yet in other moments her reactivity provides a more emotive side to the partnership.Overall, this is probably the second or third best film of the franchise. And to do that ten films along is a testament to the series.X marks the spot, and they did hit the spot.7.6/10.",2023-10-10
"When I heard about Saw X, I wasn't interested because I knew about Jigsaw and the gruesome games. After stomaching Saw I and Saw II, that was it for me. Now fast forward to Saw X, I read the reviews and watched a couple interviews and saw the trailer and it was the story that intrigued me. So I gave the Saw franchise another shot. I was prepared for the gruesome traps and more - and boy- it did not disappoint. Loved it and John Kramer is the man! Highly recommend for any horror fan. I hope there will be a Saw XI and I will watch the other Saw movies - not sure if binging all 7 episodes would be a good idea 😊.",2023-10-03
"How do you outdo yourself with the tenth entry in a franchise? Well, Saw certainly did.Saw X is more story-heavy than its predecessors, with half the runtime being devoted to John and his story, it's a bit of a slow burn but it was well worth the time.Tobin Bell yet again shines in this movie, perhaps outdoing every performance he's given this franchise in the past.It pays off in the gore department when it gets going, it's a very gooey and satisfying story, and the motives behind the kills in this movie is, perhaps, more well done than any other entry in the movie.Having seen most of the franchise to date (I did miss Spiral), this one was the most intensely pleasurable and darkly satisfying movie I've seen in a good long time. The Saw franchise is absolutely alive and well, and I think it's got some promise for future sequels.Remember to stay for the mid-credit scene!",2023-10-10
"This franchise should of ended at III, and they certainly shouldn't of made more sequels after 3D. But omg did they completely change my mind on that fact. This movie is far from perfect just like any saw movie, it has inconsistencies, plot holes, filler and traps that wouldn't really be possible in the real world. But the traps are some of the most interesting in the series and they're tense again!! Throughout all the traps I was wondering and hoping the characters would make it and the traps were very cleverly made, they reflected the characters sins and they had struggles that were still survivable. The acting is very good for the most part and this movie does something very interesting for the saw franchise, instead of being convoluted and filled with flashbacks and filler it goes for a very real and very simple story. The movie decides to make John Kramer the main character instead of the ones in the traps, and it works perfectly while the movie does have a slow start due to it focusing on John Kramer's life and him trying to get help it makes the reveal and the start of the traps all the more impactful. This movie has great character and is a very very fun watch, I recommend this for any saw fan and reccomend it for a lot of newcomers too (however I would recommend seeing the first 4 movies for full understanding of what's going on, but it's not needed as long as you know the moral code of jigsaw)",2023-10-23
"Wanna play a game... again? Of course I do.Saw X is the 10th entry into the long running Horror franchise that started way back in 2004 and created a horror icon, Jigsaw. The filmmakers decided to not go for a continuation on Spiral, which came out 2 years ago, and instead focus on events that happened between Saw and Saw II.So why make this decision you may ask? That's a very good question and I will answer it in the best way possible... to bring John Kramer (Tobin Bell) and Amanda (Shawnee Smith) back. In the grand scheme of things and the convoluted lore, does this really work? It does in the most satisfying way.Firstly, it's an inspired idea to have John Kramer as the central character to this story. While the movie still has its gory and cringe-inducing moments, it really does have a lot of heart. The movie deals with the internal struggles of people who are diagnosed with cancer, what it means to have hope ripped out of your hands and how legacies can continue when you don't have much time left in your life. In a really sadistic, yet satisfying way, we route for John Kramer and his intentions around the plot of this movie. Aside from these touching moments, you still have the blood, guts and gore but by adding this extra dimension, it gives you a new understanding to the Saw franchise as a whole. The relationship between John and Amanda doesn't seem to have skipped a beat (minus Amandas very distracting hair) and leads nicely into the events that transpire in SAW II and Saw III.Let's move on to the acting. I can't write about this film without mentioning the terrific performance by Tobin Bell, who totally embodies Jigsaw/John Kramer. His stellar performance is recognised more in this entry due to him being present for 90% of the movie and the film shows us John Kramer for the first 30 minutes instead of going straight to the carnage candy. On the other hand, while I applauded at the return of Shawnee Smith as Amanda, I thought she was less impressive in the role but not exactly bad (might have just been the hairstyle). Other than these two main leads, each and every other actor in this film give grounded performances that make you believe the pain they are withstanding in the traps.Speaking of traps, these are definitely some of the more memorable traps that have been shown through the franchise and had me, a seasoned horror fan, still cringing at the sight of the gore on display. Each trap felt dirty, industrial and very handmade which made you feel every ounce of blood that is spilt in this movie. These cringe-inducing moments would not be possible without the brilliant special effects team and this leads me onto the technical sides to the movie.The cinematography, lighting and editing was a major throwback to the original Saw films while still feeling rather modern. The movie employed the dirty greens, yellows and oranges in its environments to make you feel like everything was unsanitary, a technique used as early as the first film in the franchise. I also have to mention that Kevin Greutert, who also directed Saw VI and Saw 3D, is back but he has improved his directing and visual style in every single way considering that his previous entries were some of my least favourite. This leap in visual quality may be down to Nick Matthews, the cinematographer, whose previous work I am unfamiliar with but I'm very interested in what he does next.Carrying on with the technical aspects of the movie is the brilliant grungy heavy metal soundtrack throughout the traps and the heartfelt tonalities used in the much calmer scenes. Also, how can I forget the amazing Saw theme that plays through some of the most pivotal scenes throughout the movie. It wasn't only the soundtrack that was a stimulation to the ear but the brilliant sound design that accompanied some of the gore, leading me to not only look away from the screen but block my ears as well.Overall, I set a high bar for this movie and it absolutely exceeded my expectations. From the acting to the gore effects to the amazing sound design and brilliant story choices, I cannot recommend this enough to Saw/horror fans. Just to let anyone know who is not familiar or haven't watched the previous entries in the franchise, this is a great jumping on point and you won't regret the viewing experience. I can now officially say that this is my second favourite entry into the franchise with only the original beating it by the smallest amount but this may change on repeat viewing. Go out to the cinema right now, grab a bucket of popcorn and have a bloody good time.",2023-10-01
"The film started off so well, but went downhill after the first 30mins.Its another Saw movie, you know what to expect. Plenty of blood, guts and those whacky doodads plus that game!Whats new this time around, well jigsaw decides to play his game in 3rd world countries against people who didnt finish high school, his sure gonna teach those pesky $1-a-day'ers something.Literally just more of the same, not the worst saw film but definitely in the more boring category.Runs long at 2hr, could of easily been 1hr30mins.If you have some time to burn and want to see some blood, this is for you. Otherwise its a total Meh!",2023-10-22
"Saw X follows John Kramer who we all know from the previous movies has cancer. John Kramer finds an experimental surgery that could possibly cure his cancer and when he finds out it's a scam, well that's when Jigsaw comes in. I recently rewatched all the saw movies because I'm a huge fan of these movies ever since I was probably 9 years old. I don't know why this franchise was always my favorite since I was a kid but they always clicked with me, I would sit and watch them with my aunt and I think that's how I became such a huge horror fan. The saw movies always try to show how John Kramer is trying to change people and their bad decisions with this torture horror. I personally liked all the saw movies because like I said they are what started my love of horror. Let's be honest they got a lot of hate but this one gave us a look at John Kramer and how it all started. This movie took us back, it took us back to some of the darker aspects that we love about saw, the traps are more simplistic, there's no lasers like everyone hated but we're back with the simple interesting and also disgusting traps. The emotional aspect of this movie with showing the hope from John Kramer and then this hope being taken from him, makes this movie something we've never seen before. The start of this movie starts off slow paced and then slowly speeds up in a perfect way. Let's be honest after 10 movies we're not coming here to see the people involved escape, we want to see some death and this movie gives us some death like never before. Like I said seeing this emotional aspect with John Kramer, it leaves you switching sides in a way. There are characters you feel bad for but at the same time you feel bad for John Kramer in this one and you want to see the traps that jigsaw does so well. If you think that we're coming into this saw movie and just seeing death, you would be wrong, obviously that is the most obvious thing in a saw movie but this movie also has some good comedic moments in it as well. This is something we don't see to often in saw movies that Saw X does really well, but what is a saw movie if it didn't have a twist ending, the twist in this movie just like many of the others gets you by surprise which is something the saw movies never lacked and always did well. This movie is probably my favorite out of all the saw movies, it did everything so well and the time between movies and being able to sit and stew all of the great things we love about a saw movie makes this movie a 5/5 for me.",2023-10-10
"Saw is back after countless bad sequels they finally give one that delivers on all levels. The traps are gruesome, inventive, and totally squirm-inducing, while Tobin Bell is at his sweetly tender best as John Kramer, delivering a side of the man rarely hinted it in previous films. Saw X (2023) Set between the events of the first two films, John Kramer (Bell) travels to Mexico in hopes an experimental procedure may cure him. Before long, however, the operation is proven to be a hoax, leading him to enact an elaborate and gruesome revenge on those responsible. This film not only pays homage to its roots but also revitalizes the narrative arc, making a compelling case for its spot in the franchise's lore. It's a testament to the storytelling prowess embedded in the series and leaves us yearning for more. Here's hoping Saw X's brilliance heralds a sequel, keeping us on the edge of our seats next October!",2023-10-13
"Probably one of the best Saw sequels, Saw X proves that when you have quality content, you can do something amazing. It was more than just fan service: it was an amazing movie. I'm really satisfied with the result.Tobin Bell is an extraordinary actor, and giving him a main role in his franchise is one of the best things that this guys could ever do. Traps were really creepy and well made. Twists were really good. The edition and the score are sublime.The whole cast is amazing in this, which is esential to keep the movie on and make you stay at the edge of your seat the whole time, even knowing that is between 1 and 2 and you already know what is going to happen next. The practical effects were chef kiss.A true masterpiece, Saw X has become not only one of my favorites from the franchise, but my favorite movie of the year. Kudos to all the cast and crew for keeping this saga alive.",2023-09-28
"The most captivating aspect of Saw X is delving into the enigmatic character of John Kramer. His relentless search for hope amid his battle with cancer is truly compelling. Those who prey on the vulnerable victims are despicable, exploiting people in dire need. My heart goes out to John, as I understand the motivation behind his gruesome traps, targeting those who prioritize their own desires over the needs of others. The unexpected twists in the plot add depth and intrigue, something I've missed in the Saw series. While one character's lack of justification left me somewhat disappointed, I found the film as a whole to be an enjoyable, albeit cringy, yet entertaining experience.",2023-10-16
"Now when I heard about this movie, I wasn't shocked. I know that Spiral: From the Book of Saw did well enough in the box office as the first to not feature the character of Jigsaw. Even the other prequel made money from what I remember. I wasn't thrilled to know that this was another prequel as they tend to not build the necessary tension for me. What does make me curious to see if they stay within the confines of continuity.Synopsis: a sick and desperate John (Tobin Bell) travels to Mexico for a risky and experimental medical procedure in hopes of a miracle cure for his cancer only to discover the entire operation is a scam to defraud the most vulnerable.I should point out that this takes place between Saw and the first sequel. John Kramer is sick. He only has months to live due to his brain cancer. He's already made people appreciate life with traps. To help cope, he goes to a support group where he meets Henry Kessler (Michael Beach). Not too long after, they ran into each other. Henry seems to be in remission. He gives the name of the doctor that helped him and John reaches out.This doctor is Dr. Finn Pederson (Donagh Gordon). It appears that he is doing is a combination of medication and surgery. The big pharmaceutical companies don't like it, so he's gone into hiding. John gets in touch with this doctor's daughter, Cecilia (Synnøve Macody Lund). She tells him that in a few months they can get him into a trial. He doesn't have that long, so she has him come to Mexico at once.Things look good. He meets Carlos (Jorge Briseño) who brings him part of the way to the compound. He is taken the rest of the way in a van. It is from there he meets Cecilia and Gabriela (Renata Vaca). She tends the room he stays in. On Cecilia's medical team are Mateo (Octavio Hinojosa) who is the anesthesiologist, Valentina (Paulette Hernandez) is a nurse and a neurologist who will do the surgery to remove his tumor. John also meets Parker Sears (Steven Brand) who had a tumor removed from his neck.John wakes up and he's told it was a success. He was transported to a place closer to the hospital just in case an emergency happened. John wanted to thank Gabriela and he went about trying to figure out where the compound was. He tries to bring a bottle of tequila that is local to the area. He discovers that he might not be cured of his cancer. There is a limited time to hunt these people down for answers and for them to receive just punishment. He will need a little help, especially in his condition to force this group to play a game and prove they deserve to survive.That is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. Where I want to then start is with something I've brought up previously about prequels. To get into this more, my problem with them is that the stakes aren't there for me. I know where we end up from here. While watching this, I'm aware that this treatment doesn't work with what goes down in the sequels. What I didn't realize until looking at the trivia, this procedure could be the one that was denied as an insurance claim, which ties in Saw VI. As a story guy, I don't think this violates continuity and fits in nicely with this puzzle that is Saw.Now that I have that out of the way, let me delve more into the story here. This tugs at the heartstrings a bit in seeing John dealing with cancer. This is a sickness that hits home for me with having people pass away or battling it around me. I'm sure most everyone has similar stories. Seeing this group take advantage of people in this condition when they're vulnerable bothers me. It is interesting as well in that, we are taking someone who is a 'serial killer' and making them the hero. Do these people deserve to die? No, life is precious. They are despicable though for what they're doing and deserve punishment. It is infuriating. It is also strategic to us to want to see them get what is coming to them. There's also that grey area since Jigsaw puts them in the traps, they need to show their will to live and overcome the pain.Let's then take this to the acting. Bell is great here once again as John Kramer aka Jigsaw. My problem here is that he is quite a bit older, trying to play a character in the past that is between other films' versions. I thought it still worked here. He looks and seems sickly which is what he needed to. This also humanizes him which is odd for what he's put people through. I also liked to see Shawnee Smith back as Amanda. Wasn't expecting her to be here, but it makes sense. Lund is good as our benevolent doctor who might not actually be that. I also like Brand, Vaca, Okamoto, Hinjosa, Hernandez and Briseño. They all work for what was needed. The rest of the cast was solid and I loved the cameo by Costas Mandylor as well.All that is left then would be the filmmaking. I'll start with the effects, since that is what we all come to see. I was annoyed at first. The poster kill is early and they do something there that feels like a cheat. The other thing I heard was that this was making Terrifier 2 look tame. I wouldn't go that far. What I will say is that the effects here are grounded. They did go brutal and I was a fan there. I also thought the editing was solid. We got that patented reveal at the end and I thought it was clever. I was annoyed at first since it seems like Jigsaw is thinking too far ahead. There are things we get to see that weren't revealed earlier that make sense though. Other than that, the soundtrack was fine. They don't use the main theme that is great, which is a bummer. It does seem there was a new variation used. The selections we got worked and fit what was needed to ramp up tension when needed. I love the Jigsaw voice, that just gives the Saw feel.In conclusion, this is one of the better installments from the last grouping. This is better than everything past The Final Chapter in my opinion. What we got though is hampered by being a prequel. I like the story elements that seem to be fleshed out here. The acting is good across the board. Bell owns this role and he shows why he's so good at it. I'd say the filmmaking was also solid. The effects were good, as was the cinematography and the editing. I'd be curious to watch all of them now and do my ratings to see where it falls. It is probably in the middle somewhere which is impressive for the tenth installment of a franchise. I'd recommend giving this a watch if you're into these movies as it is closer return to form.My Rating: 7 out of 10.",2023-10-16
"Hopefully by this series tenth installment one should have no doubt regarding the gore they should expect when going to watch this. Despite how downright nasty and grotesque sone of the scenes are, it has my attention the entire time trying to figure out how it was all going to play out.This is the kind of movie where you either were able to handle the gore or you thought it was simply grotesque to sit there and watch the movie play out. My movie going partner was nothing short of appalled and blown away by the film and not in a good way. We usually agree on most films but certainly did not agree here.If you like previous Saw installments you will likely appreciate this one. If you haven't before, then this won't change your opinion either.",2023-10-23
"Saw X is the best since the first one. As many have stated, in this one John Kramer has a very clear motivation for forcing some truly evil people to play his ""games"". Tobin Bell has a chance to openly act out his emotions along with his partner Shawnee Smith. And the beautiful Synnøve Macody Lund plays the unctuous ""Doctor"" Pederson with aplomb. As my dad used to say, ""they deserved a good killin'"". Indeed, the denizens of this movie certainly deserve what they get. There is plenty of gore and blood to go along with the great acting and direction. Definitely recommended for ""Saw"" fans - and even some who never seen the preceding films. 7/10.",2023-10-08
"This was really a John movie, and I am loving that! As soon as the Lionsgate and Twisted Pictures title played I knew I was back into the realm that is the SAW-universe: my favourite horror movie franchise! We saw in this film more of the man rather than the monster that is John Kramer, we witnessed what he and his assistants are doing behind-the-scenes of their games and that was a nice change. Saw more of his compassion, keeping to his word that he to help his players, getting them medical help after they complete their tests. The heavy rock music made me feel that I was watching the older Saw films an the colour-palette lighting was nostalgic as well! Whenever I hear ""Hello Zepp"" fade in at the end of the film it is ALWAYS encapsulating to see what the new twist-ending will be! I am very excited to see what future instalments of this franchise will bring! This movie has me still with a few questions left in my mind that weren't answered, but just like in previous films we will eventually get an answer in a future sequel from this.And thank you for bringing back Amanda and Hoffman! I was hoping we would get Costas back into one of these films, and me seeing him back me cheer aloud in the theatre with astonishment on my face. Amanda is always welcome return to more Saw films, and I am still awaiting to see what happened to Hoffman after Saw 7...these movies can continue to take place in-between previous films and I would be fine with that idea!I am ready to have this franchise bring out a new film each year again!",2023-10-04
". . . the bloodiest atrocity in Modern History, SAW X is perfectly timed as a social commentary capturing the essence of Today's Headlines. One would think that the invading horde had been training with an advance copy of this picture, since their outrageous war crimes parallel John Kramer's on-screen traps so closely. Of course, John himself is a perfect gentleman compared to his Real Life counterparts. He does not perform a raucous war dance in front of distraught parents while nuking infants in the family microwave. He does not play ""This little piggy"" with actual knives lopping off toddler digits. In fact, John brightens soccer boy Carlos' family finances. As with CLOCKWORK ORANGE, all the student protesters infesting our U. S. Homeland should have their eyes taped open and be compelled to view SAW X continuously until they're thoroughly reprogrammed and civilized.",2023-11-01
"They had everething, John Kramer, Amanda, modern CGI, but I feel like this movie could have been so much more.After finishing it, I was underwhelmed. The traps and the gore was spot on, but as far as the writing and the tempo, ending, there is a lot to discuss...The first 30 minutes of the movie could have been reduced to 10 minutes and the viewers would have exactly the same amount of background knowledge.The traps were great, but I feel like the blood-boarding trap was nowhere near as brutal as the other ones. And it makes my brain itch knowing that the poor ""nurse"" had to cut of her legs, and extract bone marrow, while the true antagonist was ""only"" going to be drowned in blood. Especially because while you have some control over the trap (lever-arm), it lacks the most mentally challanging part, harming yourself in ways you could not imagine in your worst nightmares.This in itself does not result in a 6/10 rating, but the last 30 minutes were an absolute joke for a saw movie. A D-tier plot twist that could be seen from a mile away, and Cecilia becoming the anti-hero and locking Jigsaw into his own trap is comical.I liked how Amanda was encouriging, I could almost see how they would think their traps change people, and show the value of their lives. But it all got shadowed by the dollar store hollywood ending.I imagine they wanted to keep Cecilia alive so there can be another movie, and it sure is a good cliff hanger, but I feel like they could have done better.",2023-10-22
"Directed by Kevin Greutert. A runtime of one hour and fifty-eight minutes. With an R rating.""John Kramer"" aka ""Jigsaw"" played by Tobin Bell is back in what I think is the tenth and final ""Saw"" film. This film goes back in time to the earlier films.""Jigsaw"" has already started his terror. He's trying to plan out his master plan with his first victim turn protege ""Amanda"" played by Shawnee Smith. When he sees ""Henry"" played by Michael Beach a so-called member of his cancer group looking very well.From looking like you're at death's front door to causally walking to get muffins at your local bakery. ""John"" finds out that ""Henry"" went to ""Dr. Cecilia Pederson"". In an unorthodox method, she cured his cancer.With perceived governments hating ""Dr. Cecilia Pederson"", she goes out of the country to do these procedures. From fear of big pharma trying to stop her. ""John"" could care less about the amount of money he has to pay or where he has to go to get this once-in-a-lifetime cure.But soon after the surgery, he realizes it's one big dog and pony show. It's the ultimate scam. Now ""John"" Will have to bring ""Jigsaw"" out of the county so everyone involved in this scam can play a game. He will have to use his allies as well as deal with some unexpected adversity. But nothing will stop him from getting his justice.""Saw X"" wrapped up the nearly two-decades-long franchise with a perfect bloody bow. It had the feel of the original ""Saw"" films while spicing it up. From a new location to different twisted games. That was supposed to be something he did earlier on and with low resources. I won't lie he did a lot with the low resources in a short window of time. But who's looking that hard?I loved seeing the familiar faces from the previous ""Saw"" installments. It was gory and wild. Creativity was through the roof. You felt like oh man of all people you wrong ""Jigsaw"". Y'all done messed up now. I was thoroughly entertained.Some people have gotten tired of these films. But I love them. Watching ""Saw"" films on every birthday has been a tradition for many years. This one unfortunately came out a little before my birthday but it's all good because family members who would have been there for the birthday showing of this were able to see it with me now.Some ""Saw""'s weren't at the same level when ""John Kramer"" finally left the franchise. The film before this one, the one with Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson was good. This one was great because it had some of the original people in it. It didn't seem forced and the film made sense the way they did it.If you're a ""Saw"" fan you will love it. If you stopped watching them, come back and watch this one. For me this was amazing. It's a weird sentimental film for me. I admit I have biases when it comes to this franchise. Even with that, it is a great Halloween-themed type film. That will gross you out and entertain you all in one. I give it five mor fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin

#SawX.",2023-10-11
"It's been two decades since plucky Australian filmmaker James Wan introduced us to the twisted and visceral world of ""Saw"", a cautionary thriller that forced unlucky test subjects to attest for their sins in gruesome and imaginative ways. The very concept could have been woven from the same fabric as David Finchers masterpiece ""Se7en"", as Tobin Bells' ""Jigsaw"", a serial killer with a knack for dishing out just desserts, became one of the most iconic and charismatic villains to grace the silver screen. 20 years (and several mediocre sequels, reboots and spinoffs) later, we are back to basics with Saw X, a ""midquel"" that is sandwiched in between Saw and Saw II. Saw X feels very different from earlier films, despite the obvious similarities (and colour palettes) and is a true return to form for the series.Unlike previous entries, we do not open with a centrepiece trap, and instead This is very much an origin story for legacy character John Kramer, and the focus is on his arc and profile. The film opens in a non-traditional way, as we see John struggling with a recent terminal cancer diagnosis, and we witness the toll this takes on him as a person. He begins attending support groups, conversing with fellow patients and the realisation that time is running out nurtures a desperation that we have not seen previously in the soft-spoken and optimistic Kramer. The veil is lifted on the ""monster"", and the emotional beats that play out as we see how vulnerable John really is, especially as up until now he was more of a ""background"" character (we only ever really got to spend time with John through voice recordings or flashback sequences, especially in later sequels). Here, Tobin Bell and John Kramer are centre stage. Bell is on screen for a majority of the runtime, and this plays to the films advantages, as it is his character who is the most interesting and mesmerising. At 81 years of age, Bell gives the performance of his lifetime, especially in the scenes where he gets to show raw emotion.The traps, which were teased on trailers are as gory and gnarly as ever. One horrifying set piece which features severed limbs and bone marrow is particularly nasty, however in a franchise that is usually heavy on violence and bloodshed, the traps here take a back seat. In fact, it takes a good hour before we even see the first real trap, and that gives us time to learn more about what makes John Kramer tick. The main narrative centres on John travelling to Mexico for a last-resort life-altering surgery. The mysterious out-in-the-sticks clinic he attends is headed by the kindly Dr Cecelia Pederson and her crew of reassuring physicians, who assure John that this expensive treatment will miraculously cure Johns' cancer once and for all. When the surgical team do a bunk and it becomes apparent that the whole thing is a huge con to defraud the most vulnerable in society, John decides to use the limited time he has left to turn the tables on those who have wronged him in the worst way.I really enjoyed the emphasis on dialogue and the heavy back-and-forth between John, his new ""subjects"" and series fan-favourite Shawnee Smith, who makes a well-applauded reappearance midway through the proceedings. This refreshing take on the Saw lore is welcomed, and having John and Amanda as ringleaders really heightens to emotion. Some of the best scenes in the whole film feature these two characters reiterating their respect and love for each other, especially when Amanda struggles to pull off the games in which she would later become infamous for. Here, she is as vulnerable as John, and her reaction towards one of the subjects (who we learn is a drug addict) is a huge turning point for the character. Shawnee Smith was incredible in Saw X, and she compliments Bell extremely well.Another standout performance comes from the villainous Cecilia, played with vampy finesse by Synnøve Macody Lund. She is a despicable and nasty piece of work, and is perhaps truly the most evil and deserving Jigsaw ""subject"" to date. Her wickedness almost makes John and Amanda anti-heroes, and you'll almost certainly find yourself routing for them to succeed in their games.To conclude, Saw X is the best Saw sequel to date. It has heart, emotion, a killer performance from Bell and Smith, great traps, yucky gore, a stunning soundtrack and it leaves you wanting more.",2023-09-29
"Just Got out of Dolby Cinema, Saw X.Great Performances by Kramer, Cecelia and Amanda.Is Cecelia going to be the Next Jigsaw? And all this Time she's been honing her Torture Skills and Traps and now 20 Years Later, she's ready to unleash Hell on her Victims?Anyway.Let's get the Good out FirstlyI really liked the Build up and Story of John Kramers Sorrow and John Kramer Staring Death in the Face with Months to Live and trying to find a Solution to his illness. That for me was a Good Premise.He Finds a Solution in these Medical Professionals. , and Contacts them and goes along with Blood Samples and Eventual ""Surgery"". And you feel for Kramer there in that moment.Let's Get onto the Traps -Some of the Traps Have more Gruesomeness than Others and Some of the Filmaking during the Traps (Quick Edits, Score, Clock Ticking Sound, Screams of the Victim) Have more Intensity than others1. Eyeball Trap - Intensity Level 4/5
Gruesomeness - 3/5It was Pretty intense, (Quick Edits, Screaming, etc.) It was Gruesome, the Fingers being Completely Snapped was Rough but would of been even more Gruesome if we slowly see his eyeballs being Extracted out of his Skull...............Man 💀 👀2. Pipe Bomb Trap - Intensity Level 3/5
Gruesomeness - 3/5The Intensity was there, slightly under the Eyeball Trap. It was Pretty Gruesome, you could see him cutting into his Arms to Extract those Pipe Bombs.3. Wire Trap (Best Trap imo) - Intensity Level 5/5
Gruesomeness 5/5This was the Most Intense imo. The Quick Edits, the Background Score, the Clock Ticking Sound in the Score surrounding my ears, and in Dolby Cinema the Blood Curdling Screaming 😱 oh man. Her Just Viciously, going back and Forth Wiring through her Flesh and Bone Marrow, You See the Wire with every Edit Further up her leg, and when she's nearly completely cut her leg off, the skin just looking flimsy as hell, it was Rough. On top of that, you have Cecelia Shouting at you to ""Just Cut it Off"" and ""Faster"". And then to Extract the Bone Marrow and The Time Running out and then the Wire Going through her Neck and her Head just Collapsing. 😳Yeah, this trap was Through the Roof.4. Brain Surgery Trap - Intensity Level - 3/5
Gruesomeness - 3/5It was Intense at times (Time Running out, Victim Screaming whilst Cutting his own Skull Open, Background Score, Cecilia Shouting once again at the Victim etc). But the Gruesomeness wasn't all that bad (obviously it was still awful to watch and go through). And the Final Iron mask Closing, we can't see his face or the aftermath of his face.5. Chain & Radiation Trap - Intensity Level - 4/5
Gruesomeness - 4/5The Intensity was there and it was not really due to the edits, background score etc, it was more so with Every Strike impact to her Ankle or Wrist (Especially the Strikes where you see the Direct Impact on Camera), it was Brutal at times. With Every Strike, the Bone just Visually Falling Apart and Completely Dismantling with Every Cringe Inducing Hit.6. Blood Boarding - Intensity Level - 2/5
Gruesomeness - 2/5It just wasn't that intense or Gruesome as the Others. Its just Water Boarding with Blood.7. Gas Chamber 1 vs 1 - Intensity Level - 3/5
Gruesomeness - 1/5It was only intense to a certain level due to wanting to see how it would be resolved.Also I think Cecelia will be the New Jigsaw. We see a Glimpse of just How Sadistic she can Be.The Ultimate Plan -""I would Die For You"" - Parker""She will Burn you"" - John Kramer1. So John Kramer reassures Amanda that the ""Ultimate Plan"" will Definitely Workout. (The Blood Boarding + Gas Chamber 1 vs 1 Plan). He gets Parker into the Warehouse and He Disables the Gun and places it into the Locker, he has ""the Money"" Placed in this Location Too.2. Unfortunately, it doesn't go to Plan and you can see Kramer think ""Oh man, I might have screwed this Plan up"" by rubbing his forehead and staring off into the Distance. And also, instead of Amanda on the Seesaw, it's the Young Boy.3. This Slightly Altered Ultimate Plan Still Works and the Young Boy Gets the Big Money Payoff for his Troubles. 😂👌💰 💵The Main Big Issue -1. Is Jigsaw Trying to Punish Cecilia? Because Cecilia is one Sadistic Vicious Woman. So do you really think she cared about Parker? She didn't give 2 Damns About Parker. So was that elaborate Ultimate Plan even necessary? I don't think so.Overall, I liked the Kramer Development, I liked the build up, I liked some of the Traps, I Loved the Ultimate Plan (even though I don't think it was necessary).",2023-10-01
"FILM: 7/10.Saw X is a welcome return to the world of Jigsaw, 19 years after the first film and two years after the last attempt to revive the franchise. This time, Tobin Bell's Jigsaw is back taking centre stage.One of the standout aspects of this entry is the script. It's a rarity for a Saw film to have a decent script, but Peter Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg deliver the best one since the first film. It adds depth to the characters and their predicaments.Director Kevin Greutert's return to the fold is a noteworthy choice. Having edited the first five Saw films (plus Jigsaw) and directed the 6th and 7th films, he brings a wealth of experience to the director's chair. This is clearly his best work.Saw X avoids some of the ridiculous retconning and excessive flashbacks that plagued the later entries in the series. It wisely sets the film between the first and second entries, offering a fresh perspective without rewriting established history.Tobin Bell is excellent, taking on a more rounded and demanding role. However, both Bell's and Shawnee Smith's ages are evident, which doesn't quite align with the film's timeline.The traps in Saw X are inventive, though they lean more towards punishment than John Kramer's original intent to teach people the error of their ways. It's a return to the franchise's roots with a touch of malevolenceFor those who prefer their horror icons to remain nebulous, this film provides more explicit details about John Kramer, rendering him in ways not seen in the earlier films. That may be to the film's benefit or detriment dependent on your preference.Overall, Saw X is easily the best entry in the franchise in a long time. It makes a strong case to stand atop many of the films in the original run. It's a surprisingly fresh take on the Saw formula with inventive traps, and strong performances, particularly from Tobin Bell. If you're a fan of the series, this one is worth a watch.FORMAT: CinemaVIDEO: 10/10.4K theatrical presentation, Detail level: Excellent, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Excellent, Encode: Excellent, Master condition: ExcellentAUDIO: 10/10.Dolby Atmos audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Excellent, Surround sound presentation: Excellent, LFE content: ExcellentMOOFIEMETER: 7/10.",2023-10-18
"After over a decade of so-so Saw sequels, I honestly didn't go in with high expectations. But boy, did this film prove otherwise. This is definitely the strongest entry in the 'Saw' franchise since the original!Without giving away any spoilers, the plot is very strong and very intriguing, and Tobin Bell gives a truly chilling and dedicated performance as Jigsaw. Some of the traps are beyond unbelievable and horrifying. Lots of classic gore you'd expect from a Saw film, but it is positively balanced with a quality storyline this time. Extremely psychological, suspenseful, and an intense ride! Many scenes that will leave you in awe.A lot of heart was put into Saw X and it's a very powerful, worthy installment that was much-needed. This Saw is as sharp as possible and I rate it a 10/10! Highly recommend it. Definitely worth seeing in theaters.",2023-09-30
The movie starts nicely establishing the story and giving you idea of the root concept. Doesn't matter if you haven't watched all others SAW ( which are strayed from concept) . Just the 1st one is enough. The story starts slowly giving you idea of what has happened after 1 St two parts and then starts the blood bath . If you are usual horror fan you may feel like everything is similar to other SAW movie still this one leaves impact with bit of emotion and good amont of blood shed. Keeps you engage and a good length movie not too long not too short just ends about time . I felt like I am back at origin of the movie which amazed me a lot as after so many SAW parts there was no hope for franchise but this has rebooted it and now they can go for another 1 or 2 movies with how John Cramer became jig saw a prequel type maybe😉just imagining.,2023-10-26
"Saw X has everything in store, from brand new traps and special effects to amazing acting and a story that actually provides more insight that the Saw Fans and Horror Fans alike didn't know about John Kramer, aka. JigSaw to begin with. I found Saw X to be an excellent installment in the Saw franchise. I always love seeing Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith in their roles as John Kramer and Amanda Young. With this tenth film in the franchise, they both know how to keep their fans coming back for more Saw films. This time around Kevin Greutert directed the the film and it was written by Josh Stolberg and Pete Goldfinger. The writing and directing is awesome, I can definitely say that this the kind of horror movie sequel along with Scream VI that needs to win awards and Oscars. It's very sad that none of the Saw films have won any major awards, that's heartbreaking, because LionsGate Films, the filmmakers, producers and the cast who made this kind of movie poured their hearts out and they made something that is very dark and terrifying, but also beautiful. The creative minds and the the thought process behind writing a movie script and making a horror film like Saw X for instance needs to be appreciated a lot more by other film buffs. Saw X is an extremely terrifying, thrilling, suspenseful and exciting horror and thriller film that will give all horror fans a great time, no matter how many times they watch it, once this great sequel hits streaming. This is the kind of horror film that I would pay to see a second and third time at the movie theater. I love how the filmmakers always add brand new twists and subplots within the film in order to keep it fresh and brand new. The filmmakers, the producers. The studios and the production companies who make the Saw movies always know how to please the fans and they know exactly what the Saw fans want to see when they watch a Saw movie. They did an amazing job with Saw X, and I definitely do want the filmmakers and he producers to do a Saw XI. As long as the filmmakers can keep the Saw movies fresh, then lets keep 'em coming. Towards the end of the film, the fake blood looked like brown or black chocolate, with Saw XI I would very much like them to make sure that the fake blood looks as realistic as possible. The effects person who did the blood, needs to work on making sure that it looks real throughout the entire film, but that's my only suggestion and recommendation for the filmmakers for when they go to make Saw XI. I strongly recommend Saw X it is a must horror sequel and it's a terrific installment. Saw X gets a super strong thumbs up from me.Written

"This saw movie is the best one released in the last 20 years.They differentiated from the normal fromula and used the first half of the film for story building.Even though I would give this movie a positive rating, I do feel it missed the mark in alot of places compared to the first couple of saw movies.Personally I actually liked this way of telling the story. The first half of the movie might seem a bit slow compared to the other saw films.And some might even consider the first half of the film more of a drama as a horror or gore thriller.But I think it's a great choice to get us as viewers invested in the characters and story.I obviously also loved how the original jhon cramer is actually back. It felt great to see the one and only jig saw back in action.But unfortunately I feel like the producers leaned to much on the return of jhon cramer, witch seems very noticeable by the amount of screen time he got.I love the way Tobin Bell portraits jig saw, but I feel like john cramer was never ment to get this personally involved with his games.I felt like John's personal bias played a much larger part in the story and his games as it should have.I also feel like an authentic saw trap would not let the victim meat jig saw, but would hear his voice trough the sound of the tape recorder. And also a authentic unbias John cramer also wouldn't intervene with the progress of the games or the choices the victims make, for example by electroctuting the victim because he refuses to play the tape recorder.iIt also felt very unfair that the first and second victim in the 2nd half of the movie both didn't survive even though they both cleared their personal tests. Tests that were in my opinion to far fetched. In previous saw movies we have seen a lot of tests that seemed pretty unfair and pretty much impossible, but ( atleats in the first couple of movies), they did feel realistic.But no matter how much I tried to suppress the sceptical voice in my head, I just couldn't imagine a reality where someone would be able to disfigure themself in such a manner. I don't think it would be physically possible for a person to cut of their leg like that, certainly not without any anastasia.And the thing that brothered me most was, that even after she managed to cut of her own leg and insert this bone marrow suction device in to her open leg, she still lost the game on time.I don't really consider this to be fair.She actually beat this insanely unrealistic and unfair game by following the rules, but only because she got a insanely low time limit she got screwed over in the end.And the same holds true for the next victim who had to extract his own brain matter to pass jig saw's game.He also did beat the game but again the insanely low time limit screws him over.Unlike the the true saw movies, the traps/games didn't feel like they were made by some psychotic mastermind to be specially tailored for the victim.It felt like the games were designed for the purpose of the progressing the story line of the movie.I have problem with victims dying on borderline impossible traps, but I do have a problem with them dying when they actually beat the traps.Also let me adress the elephant in the room.This is not necessary something I find wrong about Saw X, but I do feel like it shoukd have gone different for it to be a real old skool saw trap.Dr. Cecilia should obviously have been behandeld after she killed parker to survive saws last trap.It should obviously have been a test on their humanity, and the one that would sacrifice themself would be saved because the gas would stop before it would cause any permanent damage, and the selfish one sticking their head out of the window would be beheaded only after realizing they are stuck inside the window.Besides that I also found it weird that Dr Cecilia and Parker didn't notice that the lat trap was made for two people sooner. And also that jig saw made such a big gamble by hoping Cecilia and Parker would put him in the trap instead of just trying to shoot him and kill him in an other way after finding out the gun doesn't work.But overall I did really enjoy this film.As a saw fan I do feel like this movie did ruin the essence and ""fairness"" of the original saw traps just like the last couple of movies.And also I feel like they could have separated John Cramer more from his games, so that the games and their results would felt more like mechanical result of the trap and the decisions of the victim instead of the will for revenge coming from John Cramer.But still I would certainly give this movie a 8.5 out of 10.It really is a huge upgrade from the last couple of saw movies.",2023-10-20
"For Saw fans who think the first 3 films were the best, then they will love Saw X.If you're like me and prefer Saw IV onwards, then Saw X is a bit disappointing.This film concentrates totally on John Kramer aka Jigsaw. Tobin Bell is excellent.The back story to him being scammed on a cure for his brain cancer is good, but way too drawn out.The traps vary from dull to extremely gory, but some are unfair, which goes against Jigsaws ethos.The big twist at the end is drawn out and way too predictable.The main bad person wins a let-off, when she is clearly the only person undeserving of surviving a Jigsaw trap, totally against the whole idea of Saw.The film is nearly 30 minutes too long.I still enjoyed it, as I have the entire series, but I would prefer them going back to the hour and a half formula, with more consistent traps and concentrating on flashbacks to John Kramer, but focusing on newer characters like they did with Detective Hoffman , the pathologist in Jigsaw and the new Detective in Spiral.I look forward to what they do with Saw 11.",2023-10-06
"I made an account specifically to review this movie, simply because I really feel like the entire SAW team really put everything they had into this project. I'm a long time fan of the franchise and really enjoyed Saw VI, but thought VII was a major step back. This entry though took the concept of the films exactly where it needed to go. One of Saw's major themes has always been Humanity - that every person is capable of great good or great evil in their lives. We see in this film elements of hope and compassion in the characters of John and Amanda, as well as the cold brutality and selfishness of the newest batch of test subjects (barring Cecilia, who may be a true sociopath but provided what I thought was the perfect adversary to John). Even though they've committed great wrongs, it's still easy to get hooked into feeling sympathy for the characters of Diego, Gabriela, Valentina, and Mateo when you witness the sheer primal fear and desperation they each go through in their tasks - a fear that all people are capable of experiencing whether they be overall ""good"" or ""bad"". The story makes you understand why John would choose to put these characters in tests, and makes the audience question whether or not it's justifiable, and whether or not to root for or against them. They've rightly brought it back so that each of the traps is technically possible to survive (though time limits may come into question when you're sawing off your leg or performing brain surgery on yourself. Then again Jigsaw has always graded Pass/Fail rather than giving credit for effort). Putting the character of John Kramer/Jigsaw front and center was the best decision the franchise could have made - Tobin Bell gives it his all in every movie, he respects the character and understands what drew fans in in the first place. Shawnee Smith as Amanda gives a great performance as well - not as hardened as she is in Saw III, but still unsure of her footing and whether or not she can, or should, take up John's mantle when he passes. These two actors deserve all the kudos - thank you for caring about the story you're a part of and the fans who have been invested in it.The new actors do a wonderful job as well - all of the main trap victims have believable performances, both as despicable con artists and as terrified prisoners. I wish we could have seen/heard a little bit more of how each of them came to be involved with Cecelia. We saw some with Gabriela, how somewhere in her life she became addicted to drugs and we can assume she's driven by addiction and desperation. But what about the others? And I wish we could have seen more about their relationship with Cecelia prior to meeting John. Did she target each of them knowing they were vulnerable and could be easily manipulated? Were they afraid of crossing her or truly 100% in on it for the cut? I don't know, but I want to give major props to Synnove Macody Lund for her performance, especially as a newcomer to the franchise. She was captivating as a villain, and a foil to John. I hadn't seen her in anything else but I will definitely be checking out Ragnarok now and hope she'll get many more roles in the future. She embodies a character you love to hate, similar to Lena Hedy as Cersei in Game of Thrones. She's statuesque, manipulative, cunning, intelligent, cold, and ruthless, and I couldn't get enough of her. Her character is absolutely vile to her core, but in a way that's captivating. Her actress does a wonderful job of playing a character who's playing a character - her pitch and demeanor as the compassionate crusader doctor is believable even though going into the movie you know she's running a scam. You also believe she's doing her best to coach her colleagues through each of their tests with the goal of them winning, when in reality it's the opposite. They're only valuable to her as long as she can use them to her advantage in some way. While I was listening to her all I could think was that I'd want her there to direct me if I was stuck in a trap, haha. Everyone was great in this film but she was definitely the standout among the newcomers.I'm also a lifelong fan of classical music, orchestral, and movie scores. Charlie Clouser took every single track in this installment up another notch. He put new emotion into this score that was somewhat lacking in the other entries, I'm not entirely sure how to describe it. I'd like to highlight 'Hello Valentina"" - the addition of the strings to enhance what she has to do with that gigli saw is outstanding, and 'Blood Board'. I listened to the Blood Board track before I had seen the movie, and if I hadn't been convinced to see it before I was after I heard that song. Honestly i was theorizing just based on the intensity of the emotion in the track that it was going to be Cecilia's father in the trap as a surprise final victim she'd have to try to save - but I was just as pleased by what we got in the movie. Carlos is the real MVP, it solidified Cecelia as possibly one of the most morally destitute humans John has encountered (and cemented that she's probably a major reason why Amanda became so jaded and started rigging the traps later on), and we saw the contrast with Carlos who was willing to put himself on the line to help John, as well as John's willingness to potentially die rather than let a true innocent suffer. If John and Amanda had been in the trap like they'd planned it wouldn't have been as meaningful, the boy was the necessary wild card element that John hadn't anticipated.I liked the designs of all of the traps, though the Blood Board near the end was my favorite.Round of applause and big ""thank you's"" to EVERYONE involved, as well as my fellow saw fans that support them. Please keep this energy in the franchise!Funny enough my mom went to see this with me (she's seen the last few with me as well because no one else I know is into Horror like I am. No one I invite ever wants to go, haha. I need friends who actually share similar interests to me I guess). She's always been neutral on them, really just supporting what I like. This is the first one she's throughly enjoyed. Two thumbs up from her, she actually asked me if I wanted to go see it again. I asked what she thought about it and she said there really wasn't anything she didn't like about it. The Saw team has done what I thought was impossible! And I thank you for it. Hey maybe this movie will convert some people to the fan base and I'll find someone else who's actually excited to go to the movies with me.I'm giving 10/10 because I think the team who worked on this movie absolutely deserves it. Fingers crossed that they keep it up!",2023-10-01
I thoroughly enjoyed the movie 3 times already I enjoyed going deeper into johns world and mindset they shouldn't have killed Kramer off. There wasn't a boring scene in the movie I was engaged from start to finish. The movie was very emotional for me. When John gets put in one of his traps that was very emotional I was rooting for him the entire time. Seeing amanda in her role was great to she really did a great job. Michael beach was excellent as well. Cecilia Pederson played her role so good I didn't start hating her til the end even though she did some questionable things during the game. I hope they continue the franchise forever you can't kill jigsaw off his work is immortal..,2023-10-01
"Kevin Greutert and the rest of the crew made a very good choice to return the Saw franchise to it's original roots and form. The plot and cast is phenomenal, especially the performance of Tobin Bell which is an aware winning performance in my opinion.I also absolutely love the way that the relationship between Amanda and John is portrayed in the movie.If you are a fan of John Kramer you should definitely watch this movie because this is his movie and his alone which will take you on an emotional roller-coaster with him.Overall, Saw X is a worthy addition to the Saw franchise. It successfully reinvigorates the series with its complex plot, thought-provoking themes, and visceral traps. Fans of the franchise will find plenty to enjoy, while newcomers will be drawn in by its gripping storytelling and intense atmosphere. If you're a fan of psychological horror and don't shy away from gore, Saw X is a must-see film that will leave you questioning your own moral compass long after the credits roll.",2023-10-01
"This is how a story should look like. It kept me on the edge of my seat to be honest.This is how a Saw movie should look like. The thing is, that it was a saw movie but it was one of the better ones as the storytelling, the cinematography was top notch.We got an actual villain that confronted Jigsaw for the first time ever and they humanized John. He finally felt like a real person with flaws and not this Know it all God.Looking forward to see what they are going to do with Cecilia!I loved this take.It made me emotional too and it was so fresh seeing a good story and also I loved seeing Amanda and Hoffman back.Loved it a lot!Def in my top 3!Keep it going!",2023-10-01
"The film is one of the best in the saga, but that's not very difficult! It has a good script compared to others in the saga, something that disappointed me a lot is the torture machine that is on the film's poster, it serves no purpose in this film but as it was in the film's promotion I expected more.Before Jigsaw had a criterion regarding torture machines, which were made specifically for each person and each person had a purpose in the film, ""Saw X"" is a revenge story that in my opinion does not match the previous films.It's a good film but it's in a film franchise rated 4 or 6, which is a fair rating for this film, honestly this film isn't that good but it deserves a 6.5.",2023-10-14
"Just seen the 10th addition in the long running Saw franchise and this one is head and shoulders above the rest. The acting by Tobin himself as a dying John Kramer is exceptional and i kid you not his performance alone if the movie wasn't in the horror genre is worthy an oscar . Tobins portrayal of a frail dying old man is brilliant, and this role stretches his acting abilities. The focus on this movie is John getting retribution on a bunch of scam artists who offered him hope of a cure down in Mexico only for the operation to be a fake and the scammers and fleece him and others of $250K. So Saw X is light on traps but that doesn't matter as here we have a story and it's nice to see Amanda Young back with a bigger role in the movie and you must and i mean must stay for the end credits to see a brilliant twist and reveal. Saw X visually is not as dark as the others that proceeded it and i liked that as watching a movie is a visual experience and most horror movies are set in the dark which kind of for me loose that visual appeal. The set up i strongly believe is set for SAW XI and hopefully we will not have to wait to long for it.",2023-10-04
"I really enjoyed this movie and the post credits scene surprised me. In the trailer I was expecting something like the corpse of Adam would have been gone and that he never died and the corpse was actually one of the victims from this movie it was a shock though. Great movie though! I hope they make another. Saw I,II,IV,V,VII, Jigsaw, Spiral and X will always be my favorite saw movies and I know that is several favorites lol but they have done such a great job for this one bringing back Amanda in the events that took place before Saw II happens. Once a Saw fan always a saw fan. You don't want to miss a chance to see this. Saw it in theaters last night.",2023-10-04
"This movie made me fall in love with the franchise more. John kramer doesn't FEEL like the bad guy in this movie which in horror movies doesn't happen often where the villain is the actual good guy. I was genuinly sitting in the theater the entire time rooting for John kramer hoping that the scammers would pay for taking a cancer patients money for fun. The traps were a little more to be desired though, they definitely weren't as bad and severe (in my opinion) and definitely could've been much much worse. But I think the main focus was the story and I really love that focus more then the traps.",2023-10-03
"I just came back from the cinema (first day of showing this movie, and first projection of the day) and I was not disappointed. It was really, really good movie. It's a prequel about Johns cancer days, so he's in 95% of the movie. All Tobin, all the time. And he played his role to perfection (as always). Next to him was Amanda (there was one really cute father-daughter moment between the two) who was also brilliant. One thing that's weird to me, is that Shawnee Smith looks like she had a very bad face-lift, when I know she haven't had any work done. How did they manage to do THAT - it's beyond me. But anyways, it's a really good prequel. There's a cool twist, and a twist within a twist. That was a very nice surprise.Btw, I'm used to movie gore (especially Saw gore), but there was one trap scene where I had got an eye twitch and got a slight urge to puke (I didn't though). THAT is how well and realistic the scene was done. When you watch the movie, you will know exactly what trap I'm talking about.10/10 from me.",2023-09-28
"Whilst some of the elements of this film worked really well (for example the traps having a simpler design in many cases), there are a number of creative decisions that really rubbed me the wrong way. That being said it is a distinct improvement on the previous 2 Saw entries so I do have to compliment the team for that.If watched with expectations for that high cummilative score you may end up disappointed. Opens the door for more potential spin offs and sequels, but I do hope they address some of the more egregious issues in the film.Also, good to see the ""mexico filter"" in full effect. Neither bad nor great.",2023-10-05
"As a longtime fan of this series, one of the things I have always wanted to see is how Jigsaw would fair in one of his own traps... and this movie gave that to me.I should preface this by saying that I was always going to like this movie to a degree since it is the first SAW film I was old enough to see in a cinema - Spiral would have proved the exception here but a certain global event prevented me from seeing that. I was so excited about this movie that despite the fact I booked my ticket online, I asked one very bemused usher if I could have the physical ticket stub for a keepsake. Even seeing the return of Lionsgate's red gears made me giddy with excitement for what was to come. So, in case the penny has not dropped for you yet... I really love these movies.That being said, this is probably the only entry in the series (excluding the Jigsaw and Spiral spin-offs) that doesn't feel like a typical SAW movie even though it's sandwiched between the first and second films. Without getting into the content of it, it's worth mentioning that SAW X is one helluva redemption movie for its director Kevin Greutert. With James Wan and David Hackl each directing one Saw movie apiece, you always got the impression that Darren Lynn Bousman was the safe pair of hands for any future films considering he has (for better or worse) directed the most entries in the series. However, for me, the man most familiar with an editing suite proves to be the most interesting of SAW's many directors in my opinion. He is a unique case since he has directed one of the most beloved entries in SAW VI and one of the most loathed entries in the franchise in the lacklustre Saw VII... 3D... Pink Blood Bonanza... Final Chapter, or whatever it's called today. But in the case of SAW X, if nothing else, it thoroughly convinced me that Kevin Greutert is more than capable of directing a bloody good SAW movie. It almost makes me wish that there hadn't been a last-minute change to 3D and heavy studio involvement with the seventh entry since after seeing this movie, I think he could done a much better job of ""finishing"" the story had he not been hindered in the manner that he was.But make no mistake this is not your typical SAW movie and it certainly was not what I was expecting it to be. Although it's the longest entry into the franchise it absolutely flew by; when I heard the start of Charlie Clouser's staple Zepp overture I couldn't quite believe it was all wrapping up so soon. And while it may not have any stakes or subplots or twists, it isn't the smartest or the goriest film the franchise has to offer, but it's undeniably gripping as your investment in the characters carries you through it, and there are more than enough elements from the other films in this movie to satisfy the more gorehound fans amongst the audience since this film does have some of the most wicked and sadistic traps yet! With the bone marrow trap being my personal favourite...While SAW X obviously isn't the only horror movie to come out this year, it is however one of the few character-based horror movies of the past few years that makes a valiant attempt to subvert the torture porn genre (and the wider genre itself) by placing our usual antagonist in the position of the protagonist, and so due to the film's narrative what we have instead of the usual run of the mill SAW movie is an ode to the numerous pulp-style revenge movies of the 1970s and 80s. We see more of John Kramer in this movie than we have in any other because what this film seeks to do is deconstruct his character, his message, his work and his disciples. Everything about Kramer and Jigsaw is analysed to the nth degree in this beautiful blood bath of a character study. When I initially saw the teaser and behind-the-scenes schematics of the eye vacuum trap, I went into this movie expecting it to be the opening scene - as is usually the case for these movies.Instead, it opens with John Kramer ""trapped"" in an MRI machine as his cancer worsens. We even get to see Kramer go through the film's iconic flash-style editing! This film is his own metaphorical test as every fibre of his being is challenged by his experiences here. So, what I thought was due to be the opening scene was actually used to illustrate how Jigsaw sees the world and the people in it, specifically those he considers unworthy. I couldn't help but find it fascinating! Ten movies in and we finally see the world for how John Kramer sees it.SAW X is intriguing but also deeply unsettling and that does come down to Tobin Bell's performance; he seamlessly slips back into his most iconic role and I couldn't possibly have any more respect for the man, appearing in a movie of this sort now that he's in his eighties. In a sense Bell's advanced age acts in John Kramer's favour; we know he's dying of cancer and even though somewhat humorously he looks worse here than he does in SAW II, you really can't help but feel for him.I was initially very sceptical about the decision to place SAW X between SAW and SAW II but with the power of hindsight knowing what happens to Kramer and his followers, it makes one man's desire to cling onto his own life all the more impactful. This franchise has always had its own internal logic over determining whether Jigsaw is a hero, a villain, or somewhere in between, but his actions in the film as its protagonist mean you are very much intended to side with him; and for the most part if not all of the film I think I did. This works so well largely because SAW X taps into a certain potential that previous entries have only briefly touched upon or hinted at - the people Jigsaw has placed in his game are all (albeit to varying degrees) bad people. You do not feel sympathy for Dr. Pederson or Paker Sears as you did for Dr. Gordon and Adam Stanheit. These people genuinely did something wrong, and it's arguably the only time in this series that Kramer's actions have been vindicated and have an air of righteousness to them. When John, Amanda and their newly blood-baptised warrior, emerge from the villa at the end of the film, quite literally walking off into the sunset, it feels as out of place as the film's title card yet it's important to remember this isn't a typical SAW movie, it's a spiritual ending for Jigsaw and Amanda. This movie did what no movie could for Kramer, and what one post-credit scene attempted to do for Amanda - it humanised them.And so, one of the more crucial aspects of the film that I am quite a lover of is that it gives me a near-perfect trilogy of films with SAW, SAW X, and SAW II. It easily feels as though these three films give you all the story that you need and could possibly want. I for one honestly cannot wait to watch all three films in this manner to see how well they mesh. Though the mid-credit scene does slightly contradict this since all roads lead back to the bathroom and another sequel is more than likely, I am happy to have these three films in isolation... and it was worth it alone to see Costas Mandylor... I did miss my Hoffman and I certainly would not complain about getting to see him again. However I can't help but feel that the beauty of this film is skin deep and that overall it gives you as the audience member your own free will to decide the ending of the story for yourself; you can choose the trilogy route or even the whole franchise route and have a series of traps and potential successors, or, depending on whether you feel that Kramer like the film's director deserves his own redemption arc, you can have the bittersweet ending of John giving up his work after his most person game ever and riding off into the sunset in true revenge-hero fashion. I certainly know which one I prefer...",2023-10-01
"Saw is all about the traps and gore and this film just fails at having good traps. One trap the lady has to saw off her leg to suck out bone marrow for the machine to survive but I couldn't help but laugh/cringe at her sawing her leg off it just looked dumb, the traps got more stupid and not better the only trap I liked was the eye trap its good I think, he has to break his fingers in time to save his eyes or they will be sucked out through the tubes which is a cool concept I thought. The worst trap I thought was the one guy had to cut out a piece of his brain and put it into a machine to dissolve to survive the trap, such a stupid idea for a trap.",2023-10-04
"I don't know how many times you can take the same characters and subject us to the same situation without it producing fatigue in the viewer. This happens with the very long Saw where while Jigsaw was alive we could see a motivator who was responsible for transforming lives in the most dramatic way possible. When he died, the saga completely lost its appeal. Now our beloved coach returns and does it in a big way while we see familiar faces and other faces that we hope die in the most gruesome way possible. Everyone knows the story: there are bad people who deserve to be punished but without losing the opportunity for extreme redemption. Despite this, the film can entertain by appealing to the sense of poetic justice that the ending offers us; Nothing offers greater satisfaction than watching villains who prey on others confront their own horrors. The story doesn't go any further and I hope its producers realize it; Otherwise they will have to invent a twin brother of Jigsaw to continue the plot without having to break the story thread with the sequels and prequels.",2023-10-09
"SAW X has climbed to one of my top favorite saw movies. It was the embodiment of the classic first three, with a twist that made me feel that GUT sinking feeling the first movie gave me. The SFX was over the top and, to my dismay, very, very realistic. Gore that made a horror geek like me feel sick, like, the first time a Saw movie made me nauseous. Amanda was also PERFECT. Shawnee has not lost her feel, Amanda FEELS like Amanda. Seeing them both, John and Amanda, working together to set up traps. Seeing Amandas confilct during that period in the timeline felt very authentic and true to her... 10/10.",2023-09-29
"I worked on the original ""Saw"" as an electrician and haven't seen parts 2 through 9. I was compelled to watch this one since it felt 10 was the return of Jigsaw, in a more mature personae. I don't know much that has happened since then but know that there is a formula to these things. Except this time, we empathize with the villain of the 1st one.And in a lot of ways, there are hints of revenge stories. Which I love. ""Man On Fire"" ""The Equalizer"" and ""John Wick"" come to mind. But instead of guns, we get elaborate torture devices.This particular movie makes you queasy. The devices are horrific to mentally wrap your mind against, and sometimes become way too elaborate for such a short period of time. What comes into question are the intricacies of the devices. Which is casually seen when Kramer (Tobin Bell) sketches thoughts.Bell is a phenomenal actor. Personally, I felt he should have had a more advanced career since in this one, he plays a cancer-riddled man in the most convincing way I've seen it. He ambles as one, speaks like one, it's mortifying when we realized he's been bamboozled into a scheme. And we feel it.This flick also made me think of ""The Sting"" The grift within the grift within a grift has always been great plotting. Especially when it's hidden so well. When the entire story unfolds, you do want to step back and dissect some of it. Try not to. The logic isn't what you go to ""Saw"" movies for.For those into torture porn. You get your fix. It's great to see Shawnee Smith embrace this role again. She adds a bit of conscience to these horrific events.I think this is worth a watch. First time we get the inner turmoil of a villain who we start to see humanity but who does inhumane things.",2023-10-10

"Finally through the eyes of John Kramer..
Some people talking about how unrealistic it seemed because he prepared everything for the traps in record time even tho he was in Mexico and didnt speak the language... ok, as for every saw movie, that is true so we kind ignore that..One thing i would point out was the suspended girl trap.. it made no sense for her to destroy her ankle first because it still made her be up in the air in front of the heating machine or whatever that was.. if she had broken her wrist first, she would have just fallen to the ground and out of the reach of the machine.....and for the last trap, it wasnt unexpected.. we already knew the female would be a goner.. we just didnt know how..anyway, great movie.",2023-10-22
"That was bad... Really, really bad. Don't know where to start from. I'll just start with the good stuff.Overall and generally the story makes some sense. ""Saw X"" (2023) is connected to the first 7 installments which is a step ahead having in mind the previous 2 movies. Some old characters are back - except John, we have Amanda and detective Hoffman. What a cool character Hoffman is! The acting is mostly good, and the first half of the movie although a little bit too long and predictable, it was interesting to watch.What I did not like was mainly the 2nd part - it almost ruined this film completely. It was boring, and the traps weren't that good. THE BIG TWISTS you can see from far, far away and they are so poorly made that it was like not watching a SAW movie, but some cliche teen horror. So many forced moments. All of the Jigsaw's plans were so risky that the chance one of them to happen was like 1:10 or even less. Forced just for the plot to move on. Ugh. This was the most annoying thing. The director and the screenwriter must be some kind of an amateurs in their job. So many unrealistic scenes there are that compared to the first 7 parts, this one looks like a non-sense parody, but not a funny one. Amanda looks too old even with the make-up.I am so disappointed!Final Score: 3/10.",2023-10-08
"The fact that they used a rather common scam made the story feel that much scarier. Cancer miracle-cure fraudsters are all over the place, and in ""Saw X"" we saw one such scenario unfold in Mexico.The plotline for this movie was set sometime between the first two instalments in the franchise. The story captured a good many tropes from earlier ""Saw"" movies, including the iconic John Kramer (played wonderfully by Tobin Bell) and that creepy puppet on a cycle.John found himself the victim of a medical deception - starting with the masterful lies woven by Henry Kessler (played by Michael Beach). This plot-twist was by itself quite ironic because John is supposedly the villain of this franchise.The Jigsaw killer, i.e., John Kramer, knew the cancer procedure he chose was risky. In fact, it was highly experimental, as Henry told him. But desperate needs called for desperate measures.However, once defrauded, he visited bloody vengeance on the con-artists - who were part of the front called the Pederson Project, run by Cecilia Pederson. They teamed up to take advantage of vulnerable (ahem) people like John.Thus unfolded a visceral and gob-smacking series of classic ""Saw"" escape-room puzzles and 'games' that, despite having nine instalments featuring much the same thing, still didn't fail to shock, awe, entertain, and impress.All of the targets - Cecilia Pederson (played by Synnøve Macody Lund), Valentina (played by Paulette Hernandez), Gabriela (played by Renata Vaca), Diego (played by Joshua Okamoto), and Mateo (played by Octavio Hinojosa) - gave amazing spine-tingling performances.The story in ""Saw X"" exceeded the framework of 'psychological thriller' and flowed into 'psychological torture'. It continued to fascinate with the way it made a game out of potentially fatal punishments. John Kramer wasn't kidding around in this instalment, especially considering he had terminal brain cancer.The man saw his work as something dutiful, even purposeful. That's what made this villain - rather anti-hero, because he wasn't harming the truly innocent - such an icon, and a fearful one at that. To him, he was delivering justice in a creative (albeit horrific) way.Blood soon flowed and lives were snuffed out as John went about doing what he did best, being a Halloween-grade 'life coach' who was very good at making people see the error of their ways. He found help in his protégé Amanda Young (played by Shawnee Smith), who aided John in finding the remaining crooks.Though the cancer cure was a lie (in this plot), the idea behind it - using genes to turn off cancer cells - holds merit. I make it sound much simpler than it really is, but the science was on point in some of the dialogues during the early portions of the movie.""Saw X"" was not an altogether complex story, let alone original, but it played to its own franchise-strengths and delivered a familiar plotline that somehow evaded being boring. I especially liked that twist near the end where John ended up in one of his own traps, and the double-twist that followed.Some of the scenes in the story weren't wholly credible - not fainting from all that blood loss and pain, to name one. But almost two hours of well-paced scares and shocks made for thrilling viewing this Halloween season. Credibility be damned, this franchise can take liberties.""Saw X"" is not for the faint-hearted. There's enough gore to make you revisit what you had for dinner. So gird your belly and watch with caution.",2023-10-27
"I am late to the party. But one statement in the review on the site carried on in the name of the late Roger Ebert sold me. I am not quoting it word for word, but this is all about the worst kind of scammers picking the wrong guy.I had an aunt. Well, she was married to my uncle, but her bright, energetic, and powerful personality made her more like one of my clan than most of my clan. She was that energetic that she scared me at times when I was a little boy. Then one day when I am in my late teens, I learn that she had lung cancer. Everyone smoked during my childhood, and everyone was warned over and over, so it was a shock and a not-shock at the same time. Long story short, they took out half of one lung, told her to come back for further testing, and they they found a new tumour in her brain. In the last months of her life, she was still possessed of a fighting spirit the like of which would still be a fright to some children, but her body was so worn out that walking from her lounge to her bed was a challenge. I have also had more than half a dozen skin cancers removed, the first at age twenty-two, and wear a scar in my face that can be seen across the room to this day.As the review also put it, this is the first time in who knows how many Saw films where the sins of the people John is torturing are sufficient to justify his actions. Odin knows that if someone had tried to trick my aunt in this manner, they would have a decent number of people with Scottish ancestry to deal with. The ""traps"" themselves, although not genius, are more on-point than any in any other Saw film. I have never had a cancer beyond that of the skin, and thankfully the most curable kind so far, but I know well that during the terminal stages, people would give anything to stop feeling the pain. Including cutting off a limb.Previously, the series' punchline was about the irony of the hero turning out to be not so heroic. Saw X switches it up a bit by making us think there is any danger of Jigsaw being outsmarted, even killed. Given that this film takes place between 1 and 2, we already know on a base level that Jigsaw will get out of this one, so the film gives us a proxy to be frightened for instead. A little boy who was unfortunate enough to arrive at the building at the wrong time. Jigsaw's and Amanda's fear that this little boy who did nothing to deserve their attention might get hurt keeps us anchored in the righteousness of their cause.This is far from a perfect film. The final act, the moment when our last two contestants think they have outsmarted Jigsaw and Amanda, drags a little, the pacing of that part of the film is off. It is as satisfying as hell to see how our chief scammers die, but cut five minutes out of that segment of the film, and it would have been more satisfying. Before I continue, I have to point out that scammers do not play to stupidity, but to emotion. People with terminal cancer will often do almost anything to turn off that time bomb, and those who promote a remedy that is not only untested but also lacks a plausible rationale prey upon that desperation, that feeling that one will do anything to make it stop. That is one clever part of this film. The scammers never go into the specifics of what they are doing and how it is meant to work, but they do give enough of a story that to a person who knows a little more about medicine than the average bear (just enough to get myself into trouble, says my general doctor), the scam here seems to have an actual, plausible rationale. Meaning our scammers are, as the final act shows, smarter than the average Bear.I will forgive the fact that Shawnee and Tobin look far older than they did in Saw 1 or 2. We can call this the Better Call Saul Effect, where the story is compelling enough to stop the audience from caring about that. No, Saw X is not nearly in the league of BCS, but now I can imagine Saul arguing for the sparing of each victim.The big surprise at the end, when the control room also has a gas chamber style mechanism, stretches credulity to an extent that can only be survived because this film does a better job than any of the other nine of selling Jigsaw's knowledge of engineering. The problem that everything has to go exactly right for Jigsaw is still present, but this time he hints that he has made contingency plans, which is a touch that would have improved many a Saw film, including 2 and 3.It is also perhaps timely that I watched Saw X at a time when I was in the middle of watching the Amazon Prime revival of Takeshi's Castle. The traps in this one have a real Takeshi's Castle flavour to them. Close enough is not good enough. We are given a real sense of wonder as to what will happen if our contestants complete the inhumane task given unto them. Indeed, one of them does succeed, and John tells Amanda to take that winner, get them to a hospital. It is true that John, or Jigsaw, has never directly killed anyone. Never caused them the fatal injury, even if the detective in 2 is right in that making a person put a gun to their head and pull the trigger is the same thing. But I will just say that our lucky contestant who should have lived to see another day is not killed by anyone on Team Jigsaw and leave it at that.I would talk about how I would improve the final act, but the simple truth is that for a series that became more comedy than fear, Saw X is a great reminder of what once was. The Saw series was never that good, but now there are four we can argue about which is the best. And this one is a great contender for the top of that dogpile.",2023-10-24
"Saw X is the tenth film in its franchise; however, it is set between Saw I and Saw II, technically making it Saw I.5. It sees the infamous John Kramer seeking medical treatment for his advanced brain tumour. He is accepted into an experimental treatment run by a Norwegian doctor and is taken to a clinic in Mexico and introduced to the daughter of the doctor, Cecilia. After the surgery, John confirms the money has been transferred to Cecilia, and is ushered to his room to rest. Later when he wakes up, he removes the bandage from his head only to reveal no evidence of surgery at all. Upon further investigation, John comes to the realization that he has been scammed by Cecilia and her team, who have taken his money, faked the surgery and left him in a now abandoned clinic. This urges John to do what he does oh so well, and with the help of his protégé Amanda, Cecilia and her team are kidnapped, and placed in traps that will not only teach them a lesson but also test their will to live!As a huge fan of Saw, and after the utter embarrassment that was 'Spiral' in 2021, I was looking forward to this as I felt the franchise needed redemption. Was it successful? Hell yes!This was the only film not to have some sort of police/detective involvement, and I liked that they didn't waste time on any sort of investigation when the fanbase just wants to see the action! This was also the first film where John wasn't the villain. In other Saw films, the audience has seen him this way, and rooted for those in his traps, but this film was different where John was very much the protagonist and his victims were deserving of their fate.For the Saw fans, there is everything. There's John, there's Amanda, there's Billy the puppet. There is plenty of blood and gore, but not in a torture porn type of way that some of the previous films have had. The traps were great, and pretty realistic too. I think audience members watch the Saw films wondering if they could go through with a particular trap themselves, and in this one, I think I could do at least two.As with most Saw films, there was a twist, and I did pick it. However, it didn't ruin anything for me because it was layered.The film has been successful so far, both in the box office and critical response, so it'll only be a matter of time before another film is greenlit, and Jigsaw's reign of terror continues. I personally cannot wait!By the way, there is a mid-credit scene, so make sure you stick around to see that!",2023-10-18
"8/10. So, who in the heck would have thought that it took 10 movies for the Saw franchise to be certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes and critics to actually like it? Very strange and unusual but here we are.This is one of the best Saw sequels and rivals Saw 2 surprisingly. Of course, it doesn't hold a candle to the classic first one. I have always been a fan of the franchise and liked most of the films.What makes this film work is bringing the franchise back to the basics and giving the feel of the first 3 movies. The plot is simple and most importantly Jigsaw and Amanda return. Smart idea to put the events of this film between the first and second movies. The convoluted baggage and inconsistencies from the previous films are wiped clean. Definitely less of ""where have they been the past several movies?"".It's fresh and different; in a good way. Surprisingly, some of it is heartfelt and adds a little of dramatic heft in the mix. It's the longest film in the franchise and actually takes its time building up the movie. Tobin Bell gives it his all in his ninth outing of the infamous John Kramer/Jigsaw. He shows a more vulnerable side to his character then switches to the creepy, morally ambiguous side.Yes, it's still a Saw film so it's filled with gnarly traps, gore, blood, holy cow moments, brutal kills, Billy the Puppet, and the signature plot twist. The traps are quite effective, cool looking, and messed up. They have a grimy, nasty, industrial feel. The twist was well done and didn't feel contrived.So yeah, go see the critic approved movie that is Saw X. Cue the ""Hello Zepp"" music, because that is the biggest twist of this bloody film.",2023-10-21
"To be honest, i like a lot this franchise and i am always overrating it a bit. I can't help myself, especially during the final minutes, listening to the theme song. I get very excited then, it will remain forever a legendary soundtrack. Having said that, even Charlie Clouser's music couldnt' save this awful latest entry, i mean SPIRAL, with Chris Rock.SAW X is probably the best SAW movie since the original trilogy. I loved the original trilogy. Movies that followed don't hold a candle to these first 3 movies. Of course, most of them were way better than an average horror movie. Still, there was a drop in quality.SAW X gets back on track after this terrible SPIRAL. Undeniably, Tobin Bell is the main reason. He is still Jigsaw, even in his age. His acting performance is marvelous. However, there are other positives here too. SAW X takes its time to unfold. Definitely, this is the best directing since the original trilogy. There is a solid story here, too. Any viewer will empathize a lot with these characters, even though they are dangerous. It's not easy for any horror movie to be entertaining and exciting without dragging, when its running time is 2 hours. Personally, i could watch easily another hour. Especially when you know that this is probably the last Tobin Bell SAW movie.I got emotional when the final twist and Clouser's music arrive. Look, i know this was not some mindblowing twist, i know also there are some flaws here, in general. But, if you are a fan of this franchise, you won't care about these flaws. This is a love letter to the fans. Of course i am being naive right now because there are no love letters, just producers who want to make money. Still, there are things you have to overlook if you are a moviegoer, otherwise you won't enjoy any movie or any artistic creation. I just want to entertain myself, not overthink it. And that's exactly what this movie offered to me: Pure entertainment without insulting my intelligence.Please be creative and keep it running: This franchise is not dead yet.",2023-11-01
"So, I will give negatives and positives regarding this movie. Overall, it was a nice experience and definitely top 5 of saw movies (but placed at spot 5 or something, not higher).I will start with the positives:Great production valueGreat lead (although. Tobin Bell is now in his 80s, he still does a magnificent job portraying Jigsaw)Great coloring ( the coloring of the movie is fantastic and really gives you a puking sensation, but not in a bad way, in a horror-like way)Change of scenery was also fresh as the action happens in MexicoThe end twist with the money was pretty sweetGreat soundtrackNow, the negatives:The story is pretty dull, Kramer got tricked into thinking he's going to be cured of cancer. But how? He used to be such a know-it all character which is also shown at the end of the movie, how could he have been so stupid as to not investigate more about this phantom company? They show later in the movie that they were able to steal the money back.. if you could hack into someone's account so easily like this, you could for sure do some research up ahead.The characters are plain stupid - they mostly shout 'What is this' ""What is that' and seem to be amazed by what's happening at every turnAmanda and Kramer look older than the action in this movie is supposed to be in Saw timeline (between 1st and 3d movie) and they were given far too many lines as to make this very obvious. While this can be explained for Kramer due to his cancer, it is not explained for AmandaAt the end.. the orchestrator and major villain of this whole scheme, remains alive after everyone who partook a smaller role has suffered a TERRIBLE TERRIBLE deathThey were not given enough time to be able to actually escape and although Gabriele does it, she is killed randomlyThe whole plot of the movie and actions were predictable.",2023-09-30
"Saw X is the tenth film in the Saw film series. This tenth part is directed by Kevin Greutert, who has previously directed Saw films, such as Saw VI and Saw 3D.The sick, desperate John Kramer (Tobin Bell) travels to Mexico. Here he heard that he can undergo a risky operation to combat his cancer. After this operation, John believes he is cured.When he learns that the people who ""helped"" him are fraudsters, he is out for revenge. John takes on his alter ego of the Jigsaw killer again, to test the people of the operation with deadly traps. The victims only have to follow his sadistic rules to survive the traps, but they have to undergo painful bloody actions to do so.This tenth Saw film takes place between the first and second Saw films. This gave them the opportunity to use John Kramer's character more. Since this character became a background character after the third Saw film, the quality and story of the next Saw film decreased somewhat.Scams like the ones that happen in this movie unfortunately also happen in real life where people scam people for money and ""help"" them with their health or other problems. Because the scammers of the operation practice are wrong people, they are tested by Jigsaw for valid reasons. This way, as a viewer, you can understand more why they are being tested, but you don't care much about most of the victims because of their wrong actions.The Saw film series lost some of its direction when the Jon Kramer character faded into the background. This caused the film series to diminish slightly. With this new film they are trying to bring back this character more. This makes this film a bit more entertaining for fans of the starting Saw film. Furthermore, the film also has fun, recognizable references and further easter eggs to the film series.It's nice to see Tobin Bell back in the role as the Jigsaw killer. Despite being described as a murderer, he still gives his victims a fair chance to survive. The rest of the cast members also play their roles well as con artists, who are later tested for their wrong actions.",2023-10-21
"This was in my top 3 along with saw 1 and saw 6, it was more than just senseless traps and gore for the sake of being shocking. You get to learn more about the type of person Kramer really is, traps on the most part were alot tamer than most other saw's bar the first 1.When it ended I was like ""really"" but thankfully there was a mid credit scene which redeemed it, still a couple of bits that could have been done better but overall I really liked it and have been a saw fan from day 1.If you just want blood and guts and traps you will feel let down as this focuses alot on story and the moral side of what has been done to him.Good to see Kramer back, it's not Saw without him.",2023-10-02
"""Saw X"" falls short of the expectations set by its predecessors in the franchise. While the earlier installments were known for their suspenseful and intricate plot twists, this latest offering disappoints on multiple levels. The storytelling is lackluster, and it lacks the intensity and cleverness that made the earlier Saw films memorable.One of the biggest letdowns is the underdeveloped characters, who seem to exist solely for the purpose of gruesome and gratuitous violence, rather than contributing to a compelling narrative. The once-innovative traps and puzzles have become repetitive and unimaginative, failing to bring the same sense of dread that the original films achieved.Despite the best efforts of the cast, the dialogue often feels forced and unnatural, and the attempt to tie up loose ends from previous films feels contrived rather than satisfying.""Saw X"" simply doesn't live up to the legacy of the franchise. It's a grim reminder that sometimes, it's better to let a series come to a dignified end, rather than attempting to squeeze out one more installment that tarnishes the brand. With a heavy heart, I can only rate this movie 1/10. Fans of the franchise, beware; this one is a letdown.",2023-10-21
"It's one of the best put together film from start to finish. The script is flesh out and yes does it do things plot wise similar to other traps? Maybe, but it's effective and the humor is dark asf, witty and nice this time around. The traps are incredibly difficult to watch but that's the art of it. If they're realistic I like them, but the film leaning on John's character more than ever, is just the way to go. This film didn't have many flaws, I get why people might not like gratuitous violence but that's the whole point, and if the traps could be made I believe he could with how early on it's in the saw franchise. Some other traps in the other films, are just to big to pull off as a CANCER patient. I like the twist, game theory, gotta be steps ahead to be your opponent. I think it's important to say it did right by not being confusing like Jigsaw for the sake of the audience or Spiral dialed up to 11, this is quality more than quantity. I would see it!",2023-10-03
"I'm not the biggest Saw fan in the world, having only seen the first two and Saw 3D, which was the last film in this entry I've seen (it's amazing to think that was 13 years ago). As much as I'd want to look at this movie as a standalone, it's hard not to consider that this is the 10th entry of a franchise and from that standpoint, not be a little impressed.Because Saw X could've and in most timelines, would've, been a tired, desperate, cash grab of a sequel. But...it's not.This movie feels like genuine heart and passion was put into it (even if I can't help but feel it was filmed over the course of a week, given how few sets there are). Instead of multiple confusing timelines and twists, we have a pretty laid back story that's mostly disconnected from the Saw universe writ large. This one seems to take place between the first two films (thankfully), so it's relatively easy to follow. (If you know nothing about Saw and bought a ticket to see this, bless your heart. Wow) Where there are easter eggs, they're done tastefully and it doesn't ruin the narrative (*cough Exorcist: Believer *cough*)The film's first chunk is a pretty compelling medical drama that sees John Kramer/Jigsaw (Tobin Bell - obviously) travel to Mexico for some experimental treatment of his brain cancer. It's a subdued and relevant set up, as not only do we sympathize with Kramer (who, let's be clear, is a murderer), but at the back of our heads, we kinda wish these morally reprehensible con artists would get their comeuppance, right? Yet, it's a testament to the situations these people get put in that I couldn't help but sympathize with them. You want to see them succeed and make it. Except for Dr. Pedderson of course (played by Synod Lund), who is easily one of the most cartoonishly evil people put on screen in a while. She's honestly fantastic though; we need people to root against in these movies, right?The traps are the stars of the show, as usual, and they're notably more restrained and realistic (to an extent, I mean none of this really makes sense). I much prefer the quality over quantity approach and there are some truly memorable (and disgusting) sequences in this movie.But, it's not all perfect. Inherent in this series is the idea that John Kramer is a good guy deep down, just trying to ""get people to value life,"" and he ""doesn't really kill anyone, they make the choice."" The film continues to parrot this idea, which I just find so unbelievably stupid. Crash course on law and ethics: at the very least, this is manslaughter, but realistically, putting someone in a situation where death is the likely outcome, but giving them a way out...is murder. It's plain and simple. Trying to paint Kramer as a good, moral person is just...so weird to me.I also can't help but laugh at some of the deliberate, 2000s era stylistic choices (those sped up transition sequences), which feel dated and silly. Also, I know Shawnee Smith is older and this movie is supposed to take place in the past, but whatever de-aging they did on her face was absolutely terrible and distracting.Finally, I can't help but question some of the logic of this movie; the idea that John Kramer would fall for a medical hoax like this, yet still be strategic and intelligent enough to set up these traps is so dumb to me. That the perpetrators of this years long, international scam would leave damning evidence AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME is also unbelievable and kind of cheap. I wish they put more effort into this aspect of the story.But, at the end of the day, this is a pretty decent horror flick and better than it has any right to be. Saw X feels more authentic and like a welcome return to an iconic franchise, rather than a cynical cash grab. That by itself makes it worth seeing. (Unless, your squeamish. Then please stay away).",2023-10-11
"I mean I call that EPIC bad luck!I absolutely LOVED this! I've grown up watching the SAW movies from a very young age so being able to watch this in the cinema's was an absolute treati've always been a fan of the SAW franchise and this movie did NOT let me down. I honestly kept my expectations very low (no expectations no disappointments right?) but this absolutely exceeded anything i could've hoped for!I really enjoyed the build up to the main events and although i could picture what was coming, it still had me gasping at a few of the scenesanyways, i cannot WAIT to watch this again and again!",2023-10-05
"As someone who wasn't a huge fan of Saw, especially the newer ones, I absolutely loved this movie. It gives you so much depth and backgorund to John Kramer(Jigsaw for those that don't know) and Amanda(the movie takes place between the first two movies). It's a little slow during the first half but the second half is worth the build up. Definitely on the slower side for a Saw movie and the ending felt a bit underwhelming for the final payoff but it still has its blood, guts, decapitations, and unimaginable ways to die to make up for it. Tobin Bell knocks it out of the park as Kramer, Shawnee Smith is as great as she was in Saw 2 and 3, and Synnøve Macody Lund is great as the likeable and eventually unlikeable Cecilia Pederson. Definitely one of the best Saw movies since the early ones.",2023-10-07
"One of my favorite in the series, Saw X successfully captures the essence of the original ""Saw"" film. It strikes a good balance between gameplay and torture, delivering a more restrained approach compared to its predecessors. I watched it in an R18 cinema, and surprisingly, it wasn't as excessively graphic as the previous installments. I cannot comment on its perception in an R16 cinema.If you're familiar with the rules of the Saw movies, you might be able to predict the ending of this one. However, for first-time viewers, the ending will undoubtedly shock and surprise.Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed watching it and couldn't help but imagine the players in this installment as corrupt Filipino politicians, receiving a much-needed lesson.Thank me later. There is a post-credit scene, so don't leave the cinema. Just wait for it.The post-credit scene will tickle your stomach. 😁",2023-10-03
"The original character John Kramer returns in an epic storyline.Both Shawnee and Tobin have given us their best performances in this movie .The twist in this movie was insane and it blows my mind, It was crazy.The soundtracks was great and I've got goosebumps when I heard ""Zepp X"", It brought me back into my old days.The games and the tests were extremely bloody, intensely gory and severe as usual.Finally with the post credits scene was amazing and all the victims got what they deserved and we've seen detective Hoffman helping Jigsaw and I've got chills when saw him again on screen.On my perspective, this movie is the best of Saw franchise.Saw X is Xcellent!",2023-10-04
"For me, I didn't know what to expect from this film at all. I was really going in expecting brutal traps with over-the-top gore and violence, which of course they did have, but this Saw movie is far more than just that now. Everyone was saying this had a compelling storyline, but I didn't know that was actually true. But now, it's all true! This is the most compelling Saw movie ever been written and directed in the whole franchise. While the first one was arguably sometimes compelling, this one felt compelling on a whole different level. This was compelling because we were actually going to spend time with John Kramer and his cancer. While it is stated and addressed in the other Saw movies, this one explores it more. This feels such a more personal Saw film than any others. The games felt more personal because for once in all of Saw histroy, the games were about John Kramer! It wasn't what John Kramer saw in people and their wickedness, it was what the wickedness and conceited con artist doctors did to him. These concieted con artists actually deserved what they got. They took away the one thing Kramer had left in him: hope. I loved how the games felt more on a personal level than ever. It wasn't just about the torture anymore, there was actually a solid, defining plot behind it all.While this is still an over-the-top gore fest violent movie, it is well written. It has such a well-written out plot, that for once: the movie is built on this plot than its tortue devices. It didn't feel like any moment of this film that it was all tortue and nothing else, the plot made the tortue have a place in the story. It felt deserved, it felt like it belonged there! Many of the Saw films just have the tortue violence there because that's all what this series is known for, but I stand corrected with this movie now: it is possible for a Saw film to have a good plot and have tortue. All it needed was its rightful place, and this movie knew where how to. I also couldn't help but enjoy also the score for this music. The hype, tense music playing during the excruciating tortue scenes was such an amazing addition to the scene. But like all Saw fans, they were waiting for that one soundtrack, ""Hello Zepp (titled in Saw X playlist, Zepp X). And I have to say, when that soundtrack got played, I was smiling like I was a Saw fan. I felt genuinely hooked and intrgiued by this whole film.While this movie is never going to win any awards, it did win my attention for it. It was the most surprising film I've seen this year. Barely any hype, it strongly delivers on the storyline; it got me hooked up, it had unexpected twists, it was a brilliant plotted out film. While Saw X may never reach more than the 7/10 it got (due because the Saw series has never been my thing, and I don't think it will), it will be one of the most memorable movie I've seen. I'm no Saw fan and me saying this actually has to tell you something about Saw X; that's it is different than all the others while still staying to the origin of it all!",2023-10-04
"10/10 Stars because Saw X depicts John's journey from finding out he only has 4 months to live, with the discovery of a new hope he would ensure during that period of time. Till now, us, the viewers were unknown of what had happened to John leading up to his death until this 2023 film - Saw X.We can finally see what John did during those last days of his life, and I am so grateful to the Director and Producers for bringing out this film to reveal that.After watching Saw X, it reveals that there will be a Saw 11 as the ending leaves us with an unknown ending of a game.Dont walk out of the cinema too early either, as there's a surprise take after some credits - don't miss that one!Sit tight, and let the games begin.",2023-10-16
"I fell off the Saw franchise a long time ago. In truth I wasn't a huge fan of the first one. I felt like I was promised things, that weren't delivered. However, I can accept it takes its place on the iconic horror list. I saw the trailer for X and thought okay I will give it a go. The premise looking interesting enough. I was definitely not left disappointed. This was a well crafted, intriguing Saw film. Though there may not have been as many traps as usual. It still managed to deliver on all parts for me, the tension, the gore, the would I if I had too?One should also take note that during the film Kramer sends an email and you see his own email address, take note and email him.. It is worth it. A nice bit of interactive horror.Definitely worth the watch.",2023-10-14
"Saw X exceeded my expectations. It was so brilliant to go back to when John Kramer got sick. As a fellow Saw fan, I agree Jigsaw does too soon. I would love to see the little boy grown up in the next Saw XI. I would love to see what happens to Cecilia and how she retaliates. It was a great ending and the sneak peek in the credits had me on the edge of my seat. I clapped at the end it was so good! I loved the storyline of how the medical team screwed John and made him think he was ""healed"" It was absolutely genius. John of course wasn't going to let them get away with that. Pleaseee make another sequel!!!",2023-10-01
"Saw X tells the story of a pre-Saw II John Kramer as he attempts to find a miracle cure for his brain cancer, only to be scammed out of his hope to survive.I believe that Saw X may be the most important film in the franchise since Saw II. I am one of the biggest Saw fans you will find... but after the failures of the last two movies interest seemed to be dwindling from the average audience members. They have been struggling what to to do with this franchise , from Jigsaw the soft reboot to Spiral the spinoff, and have had discussions on Saw tv show. Saw X was the return to roots that I think works great as a placeholder to keep fans invested while they work out what to do next.I think Saw X is.. pretty decent. I believe it is the most cinematic and best acted Saw ever done. Tobin Bell is fantastic as always, Synnove Macody Lund is phenomenal as Cecilia, Renata Vaca as Gabriela was also a standout. Not to mention Shawnee Smith, Michael Beach and Paulette Hernandez plus more giving great performances. I believe this is what drives the critical buzz this movie has. It is shot well and has the feeling of Saw movie without being done before.They clearly went into this film with the goal of making Jigsaw the hero of the story. As the audience we know he is a villain but they do a wonderful job of making you feel his humanity here. You see his frustration, pain and humanity like never before. They also went sort of the way of Saw 6 in killing off deserving victims. In other Saw movies characters were tested for being too dedicated at finding justice, being depressed, being a police informant ect. It made the traps seem cruel and vicious. Ultimately if victims failed their traps you felt devastated. This time you are more okay with some justice being dealt.So the Saw Staples....
The traps are fine here. Unnecessary timers are frustrating but they are practical and fitting to the victim's transgressions.Storytelling is the most basic here it has ever been. It takes it's time in the first act getting into the story which I am more than fine with. We haven't seen Jigsaw like this before and it is worth the run time in my opinion. I will keep this vague in being spoiler free but I was slightly disappointed with the lack of.. Saw-ness. Being a prequel, you naturally know some facts about where we end up here. This movie has the least ambitious ending they have ever had in the series. They didn't try too hard and send it off the rails like in Jigsaw or Spiral, but to me it just felt like this was a place holder in the series rather than a story that needed to be told. We get great character development but the story itself seems inconsequential to the first 9 films which, while not a deal breaker was disappointing. My initial react leaving the theater was ""oh thats it?""So overall I think this movie will keep the franchise going and showed what makes these movies great.it was disappointing to die hard fans with the lack of cohesive story telling to what came before but this is a film we can all get excited about. Bring on Saw XI!!!",2023-09-30
"The return of John Kramer, aka Jigsaw. How far would you go when you don't have any hope to live? A very good motivation for the return of Kramer.The drama kicked in when Kramer thought he was cured from his deadly brain cancer. He literally wanted to stop his Jigsaw games.Alas, con men gave him false hope and Kramer went back with his complicated games of self sacrifice for his targets' lives.Synnove Lund played Pederson, the brain behind the con. She was a familiar face, at the same unknown in Hollywood. She brought her A game in acting, convincing the audience with her angelic beauty and smiles. But, she played a demon in sheep fur convincingly.For those confused with her end, she was trapped in a room with proofs of her con and proofs she killed Sears, hee partner.The return of Amanda added her emotional conflict, trying to allow some targets to save themselves by clueing they needed to play the game Jigsaw prepared. Adding a layer of confusion to figure out what's next.Overall, a very satisfying Saw franchise returns. A must see for the fans.",2023-10-30
"A modern day horror masterpiece. In two words? ""Beautiful"" and ""Brutal"".Everything I've ever wanted in a Saw sequel, really the sequel I've been waiting for since 2010. It's amazing to see the franchise in the hands of someone that truly, truly gets it. I knew Kevin Greutert was going to be the man, he's been one of the pillars of Saw since the beginning.I argue the series would not be at all as distinctive and unique without the editing magic that Kevin has done over the past almost 20 years. Not to mention the fact that he has already directed one (now TWO) of the best entries in the franchise.Tobin Bell is a legend that will be remembered for generations to come, not just by horror genre fans, but by audiences everywhere. His artful performances grab me and make me feel what he feels. Bell is a true thespian and a hard worker in his craft. I truly idolize the work the man puts into every role he takes, no matter the genre, but I especially admire how much he cares about John Kramer.SAW would be nothing without Tobin Bell and his performance as this character. His chemistry with Shawnee Smith is still as real and heartbreaking as it was more than a decade ago. The pair have one of my favorite relationships in cinema, and they still tap into it effortlessly.Shawnee Smith is as amazing as Amanda as ever, and her beauty will never cease to shine.Saw X was Everything a fan could ever want and then some, as the greatest horror franchise ever returns with yet another genius concoction of mystery, emotion, and, of course, gory carnage that few movies today even dare try.The traps are gruesome, inventive, and totally squirm-inducing, while Tobin Bell is at his sweetly tender best as John Kramer, delivering a side of the man rarely hinted it in previous films. There are all sorts of Easter eggs and callbacks to the original movie for fans to gobble up, and there's an awesome mid-credit scene. In short: I came, I Saw, it conquered, and I can't wait for what the series holds in store next.Not since ""terrifer 2"" have I been this utterly thrilled for whacked out carnage, and Saw X certainly surpassed all expectations.",2023-11-02
"Well, to be completely honest about it, the movie started decently good, even if it gave the vibe of an advertisement with how expected and over positive the scenario was.It felt like they are talking from a book, rather than a movie.But the fact that the movie was from the perspective of John, it made me have some sympathy toward him and also lost the excitement about the motives behind the traps.The secondary actors expressed themselves poorly especially when they were bagging for mercy, it is like they share all the same personality and back story.The plot twists were expected and based on luck more than planification. I mean who plays football at the middle of the night, and the kid, how could he just smile at the end after he saw tons of blood everywhere? Hello trauma?Another thing, is the amount of effects on Amanda's face, it felt like she is coming from a dream, and where is her story? Why she did help Gabrilela but stopped right away?The yellow effect in the movies editing, it felt like a cowboy movie, the bodies look fake more than how usually Saw movies makes scenes look extremely realistic, which gives the right amount of terror to actually get out of the cinema shaking and surprised.I believe, if John could survive, and actually get ride of those big dr--ugs cooperations who stoped his treatment we will have more fun, I am genuinely disappointed.",2023-10-24
"SAW is one of those franchises that I feel like it should have ended long ago. SAW III had the iconic villain die but nope the franchise continued. SAW 3D was titled the final chapter but nope the franchise continued. Somehow, this franchise managed to get to its 10th entry but is there any worth to it or is this just another pointless cash grab?Firstly, I love how this entry does something different. For the first time in the series, John Kramer himself is the main protagonist. Previous entries would usually have a protagonist who is trying to survive his traps. We get a lot more insight into his moral code and we get to see a more human side to him. One thing this film does well is make us fully in support of Jigsaw. Sometimes Jigsaw will make certain people be involved in his games but it is very questionable whether they deserve it. This is not the case in SAW X as the antagonists are just vile human beings who prey on sick individuals. Additionally, having this movie set after SAW I but before SAW II was a good choice. This meant not having any of the convoluted baggage of entries after 2.Tobin Bell returns as Jigsaw and he gives a great performance. I loved seeing him portray these new sides to John while also showing his anger towards these scammers. Shawnee Smith also returns as Amanda and seeing more of her relationship with John was a big focus in the film. Amanda is having doubts about being able to follow in his footsteps but John being a mentor and encouraging her is surprisingly heart-warming in a torture movie. I do like they also explore the idea of whether one truly deserves it or not. The scammers all have different levels of involvement in the scam, does someone with minimal involvement deserve to be in the game? They also raise the question of his moral code. John believes everyone deserves a second chance which is why his games have a chance of surviving. However, these scammers are terrible and one of them is truly unforgivable. It is doubtful they would changed if they survived. Both of these are raised by Amanda to John and build up their eventual conflict. The biggest reason anyone is watching these movies is the traps which are enjoyable enough in SAW X. They are not overly ridiculous and gratuitous like some previous entries but they are gruesome enough to make you want to look away.Nevertheless, the film does have some problems. There is a twist in the 3rd act that is a little questionable. You have to wonder why the characters bothered to take that risk when it could easily go wrong. Additionally, the conclusion is not very satisfying because it not giving a proper closure to a certain character. John also has a thing against bringing innocents into his games but in future films, chronologically, he brings people who made honest mistakes and even used a player's child as bait. John is very flippant with his code.Overall, this is one of the best SAW movies in a long time. It brings something fresh to the franchise and feels like a coherent movie. I still don't think there should be any more in this franchise but the studio is obviously going to make more. However, if it is of a similar quality to SAW X then I might warm up to the idea of more SAW.",2023-10-21
99% it's weird how an tenth film in a franchise is the best it really is first i was hyped for this movie bc i heard jigsaw was coming back than hearing it was during saw one and saw two is perfect than i got so hyped every single day any leak of this movie i would watch than the poster came out not the biggest fan of it but than the trailer came out i just knew this movie would be so great just bc of the story and hearing what people thought of it i'm like no way this is the best saw movie for me it is it's perfect i want more saw movies like this not what we had before and this movie actually made me emotional for amanda's character how much she cares for john and you feel bad for john in this movie the whole story around him was genus the villain of the movie is probably one of the most crazy villains too and the twist of the movie was not a twist that you predict or you're like come on i can't wait to rewatch this movie many many times and buy it on blue ray 99%,2023-10-22
"First SAW movie was a thrill. It lived from the suspense of not knowing what's going on, who's behind it and the big plot twist in the end. Probably the best in years of cinema. All the follow ups are just torture porn. This one was even lame. John kramer is an old weak guy dying from cancer you feel sorry for. Where is the thrill in that? All so predictable and boring. You know he's gonna punish the people who scammed him one by one. By the way, absolutely stunning how fast he could pull off all the invented the traps in mexico for them. Completely unrealistic. Same goes for the victims who seem to be super strong and painresistent. One can even manage to remove a part of his brain by himself without passing out. Complete utter nonsense. I don't know why the good reviews. This was horrible, lame and unoriginal like all the others. Cheap torture porn.",2023-10-21
"The story kicks off in what the filmmakers have said to be mere weeks after the first movie, where John Kramer is given the devastating news that he only has months to live due to his progressing brain tumor. With no options left, John takes a risk with alternative treatment. Doctor Cecilia Pederson (Synnøve Macody Lund) runs an independent operation with the goal of healing terminal cancer patients through an experimental surgical procedure. When she's referred to John by a fellow cancer patient who now claims to be cured by this ""miracle"" treatment, the Jigsaw Killer packs his bags and heads down to Mexico where Doctor Pederson's practice is currently located. After being put through a suspicious ""surgery,"" John discovers that he's the latest victim of a fraudulent medical scheme.Is the movie many fans have been waiting years for.

"Let's play a game...it involves splatter horror.This film ""Saw X"" takes place between Saw (2004) and Saw II (2005) even though it's been released almost 20 years later.So if you're looking for something frightening to watch for Halloween look no further.When a movie has a moment known as ""the eye vacuum trap"" scene you know you're watching the ""Saw"" franchise.This is the franchise that put Aussie Directors James Wan & Leigh Cornell on the map in Hollywood and they haven't looked back since with fingers in so many pies it's hard to keep up thanks to Blumhouse.Fun Fact: James Wan has the original ""Billy"" (creepy doll on the tricycle) in his collection because he actually made it for the very first ""Saw"".""Saw X"" marks Tobin Bell's ninth appearance as John Kramer (aka ""Jigsaw"").He was absent in Spiral: From the Book of Saw, however, a photograph of him was featured in that film.""Saw X"" is also the first instalment of the series to feature John Kramer as the main protagonist, which is kind of refreshing, not just some disembodied scary voice on a recording.Although this film doesn't open with a ""Jigsaw"" trap before long there's one that will make you cringe and avert your eyes from the screen.Singer/actress Shawnee Smith reprises her role in this film.She previously reprised her role in Saw VI.""John Kramers"" search for a cure to his terminal brain cancer leads to an off the grid Mexico clinic.Of all the people in the world to try an con why would you target John Kramer, the former Engineer turned sicko.The first time this series of horror/torture films has been set south of the USA border.One of my takeaways from this movie is that even pyscho-chickens like Kramer need HOPE in their life.At least his PURPOSE was still driving him.There is even a scene where the recuperating Kramer is seen having a pleasant breakfast in Mexico sipping his morning coffee and doodling designs for another nefarious trap.Watch out for: Mid credit scene with Aussie Costas Mandylor reprising his role as Detective Mark Hoffman for the sixth time helping set up a trap with Kramer for someone who really deserved to die a painful death for his lack of morality.""Saw X"" is not retribution, it's a reawakening!Witness the return of ""Jigsaw"" if you dare, just don't fall into one of his gruesome traps.",2023-10-12
"To be honest I was not anticipating the movie to be this engaging. Not having seen the first instalment I didn't really know what to expect. I was at kept at the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. The suspense was unbelievable and the acting from
John Kramer was stellar.The visual and special effects were extremely realistic and also very revealing. I don't think that the audience was expecting the amount of blood that was shed.I had never even heard about this movie until a couple of days ago when the trailer was launched. Will definitely watch the original. A must for everyone!!",2023-09-28

"Just got back after theatre. And here's lots of to be said. I'm a big saw fan, and personally didn't like last 2 movies(Jigsaw and Spiral), so my expectations for this were kind of mixed. But I'm so exciting about this movie, there were many unexpected and unique things that done really well. Maybe even note everything you'll got from first time. There was no distribution on the screen and you just dived into the story and you fell like as a part of its decisions. The actors playing and emotional part with brutal traps are making it a good saw film. I have never written reviews for movies, but this one truly deserves it. 10 out of 10!",2023-09-29
"It's really not that good. John is great however the rest of the cast are like they're out of a episode of Eastenders! (the acting is awful) . A few good gory scenes help the film but unlike the other saw films there's no twist at the end.! An absolute let down. The stroyline is very predictable, you've seen it all before really. They need to end the series now, in my opinion just stick to the first 3 saw films. I can't believe the scores, I've got too be honest I have to question whose giving these. Overall I wasn't expecting a great film just an average one, however it's not even that in my opinion. 2/10.",2023-10-22
"I didn't watch all of the Saw series, but out of 4 Saw movies I've seen, this one is the most interesting one. I guess cause it shows Jigsaw's humane side. He was being conned, being taken advantage because of his illness. It's refreshing to see him on the bad side of the game. The plot twist was really good, I liked it a lot. It's just that the ending isn't so satisfying. Seeing how not all of the guilty being punished accordingly. He let the mastermind lived! How could he?! Why would he do that?! Out of all of those criminals, she's the one who deserving the harshest punishment! That's very disappointing! Because of that, I took one star from my initial rating. I hope to see a better Saw installment next time. I'll keep my fingers crossed for Saw XI...",2023-11-01
"Up to this point, I've never expected much from the Saw franchise. I've always seen the movies as average at best, with few selected movies being the exception. But I must give credit where credit is due.Tonight, I had a double feature with my friends. We started the night with The Creator and topped things off with Saw X. Never would I have thought I'd come out of the theater saying Saw X saved the night. My disappointment in The Creator is just... well, I'll save my thoughts for the review.But Saw X blew me and my expectations away. My only complaint is that it took so long for quality to show up in this franchise, and this movie just proves without a shadow of a doubt how much Tobin Bell as John Kramer/Jigsaw carries this franchise on his back.If you are anything like me and always wanted more of John Kramer out of Saw, then look no further. Saw X brings Kramer front and center with a good story, good writing, good characters, and good acting. From a franchise that I expect none of these things to be in. I mean, the horror genre in general, in my opinion, lacks all these things with very few exceptions.But the writers and director really stepped things up in this installment of Saw. I still can't believe how much I enjoyed this film.So if you're a horror fan and / or Saw fan, do yourself a favor and watch this one. I can't say it's a must-see in theaters, but I want to see this movie succeed in the box office because it genuinely deserves the support.PS. Stay for the mid-credit scene it was so satisfying!IMDb: 8/10
Letterboxd: 4/5Watched in Theaters.",2023-09-29
"I had the privilege of attending the world premiere of this film tonight. It is hard to argue that 'Saw' is not the most consistent horror series ever made. To be 10 films in and still producing masterpieces is truly remarkable. And 'Saw X' is, in my opinion, a masterpiece. This film exceeded all my expectations.The motivations of John Kramer and whether they are justified or not have always sparked great discussion among horror enthusiasts and 'Saw' fans alike. This film acknowledges that. It cleverly references this debate in a way that is both playful and serious when spoken by Kramer.However, this film differs slightly from others in the series. This time, we have a revenge plot and regardless of where you stand on Kramer, he is likely to be your undisputed protagonist here. I found the addition of the revenge element to be brilliant. It adds another layer to the darkness we are witnessing and makes everything more complex.In terms of set up, this movie is probably the most patient the series has seen yet. It takes its time to align all the pieces and get down to the intense business. Once it does, the second half of the film moves at an electrifying pace.This film was incredible. It exceeded my expectations. 10/10.",2023-10-29
"By coming in at just under two hours, you knew 'Saw X' would change up the formula somewhat. Previous entries have had a story (and unlike most, I actually enjoy them) - and no matter how convoluted they may seem or get, by this point I've rewatched them to the point I have an encyclopaedic knowledge - but this one is more character-focused and straightforwardly structured.I liked the revenge angle. John Kramer may have a demented philosophy in the way he ""rehabilitates"" bad people, but underneath all the engineering and gore is a worthy goal at least. Here Jigsaw is the victim, and goes to extreme lengths to make those people pay. It was a neat idea to make the traps relevant to the victims in some way whilst also keeping them medically linked. Each trap had purpose - and was appropriately gruesome.Tobin Bell puts in a great performance. He has the most screen time here than in any of the other Saw films, but he holds himself admirably even in some of the most demanding physical and emotional moments. Having Amanda by his side worked well, fleshing out their working relationship and showcasing a bond that has grown between them.And of course there's a trademark twist ending to wrap everything up. I didn't see it coming so was pleasantly surprised, and the iconic theme music is always welcome. Overall, this proved a worthy addition to the franchise. The focus on a purposeful story was good, the production design is yet again faultless, and there's enough gleefully nasty gory bits to satisfy longtime fans. Make sure you stay for an awesome mid-credits scene too!8/10.",2023-10-12
"I enjoyed it. I saw it in a theater and it was definitely worth it.I really loved the story. After finding out that he has brain cancer, John Kramer travels to Mexico for a medical procedure. After he discovers the entire operation was a scam, with a help of his partner Amanda, he kidnaps the people behind the whole thing and he tortures them.I love the twist, they were very surprising. I just can't believe how good this movie was. There were a lot of scenes I barely watched.It's more a thriller movie rather than a horror movie.I never saw any Saw movies but after seeing this I'm definitely watching the first one because Saw X is a prequel for this one.It's a great film with great twists.",2023-10-22
"I enjoyed the first two Saw films a good deal, but after that I have not liked much since. This new one I had no expectations for and I was surprised at how good it was.It felt like the old movies again and Tobin does a wonderful job with his acting here. Saw is back and its wonderful to see it being at a high quality for a change.I never expected the Saw franchise to get back on track but whoever put this together did a wonderful job, its fantastic. I hope we get more movies in this trilogy like this one, keep whoever was in charge of this in charge of the next movies please.I think new people who never saw the Saw movies would even enjoy whats here. Newcomers and old fans alike should check this out.",2023-09-30
Overall I'm not going to give many spoilers but I didn't pay to see this movie in theaters I found it on a free website and overall if you're looking for a great saw movie this is not it... In my opinion I do not think this is one of the best saw movies but it does fit in the entry. Overall I decided to give it 5 stars out of 10 because I think it's fair. It's not really that scary. The movie is very predictable. You can definitely guess what's coming. The traps were definitely new but I think they should have added more traps in the movie with more violence and Gore. The music could have been better. You only get to see Hoffman at the end credits of the movie. John Cramer did talk to Hoffman on the phone for a few seconds but that's all you getfor hoffman. I was definitely looking for more of a Hoffman showing in the movie which you didn't get. You get more of Amanda than you do Hoffman.Don't go into this movie thinking you're going to be scared out of your seat. Don't go in this movie expecting to be blown away. Don't go into this movie expecting it to beat the original Saw movies because it doesn't. Where would I put this movie on my list. I'd probably put it towards the bottom of the bucket. I think jigsaw is probably one of the worst movies I've seen and yes this saw 10 movie is better than jigsaw in my opinion. But that's not a bad thing because like I said this is technically not a saw film. It's more of emotional film where payback is certainly coming to the bad guys. It's not about killing The bad guys it's about teaching them a lesson for all the people they stole money from. It's about payback revenge because they didn't just hurt one or two people in this movie They hurt close to 40. If that makes sense You might have more emotional feeling in this movie than any other saw movie. I got more emotional in this film of what these bad guys did to John Kramer with his brain surgery than anything else. It's not your typical saw film like the others. It's totally different and the reason why I'm giving it so low of a rating is because I'm not treating it as a real saw film but I guess everybody's rating and opinion is different.. It's not a terrible movie but it's certainly not a great movie in my opinion. I am happy they released it but I'm hoping for the next movie for them to bring Hoffman more and go into a better storyline of if Hoffman actually lived. I would like to see Dr Gordon More. I would like to experience a better storyline to see if Adam is still alive. Things like that so overall where do I want to leave this review.There's not much more to say except it's not a bad movie. It's not terrible. It's just not one of the best like the first two saw films. My personal favorite saw movie is definitely saw IV. But overall I think people probably will enjoy this movie but just don't go into this saw movie expecting to be scared expecting it to be very bloody expecting it to be like an original saw movie because it's technically not in my opinion .. I'm doing the best I can here to explain myself so hopefully you'll understand what I mean...Would I watch this movie again. Yes probably two more times and that'll be it. Is it worth seeing in the movie theater. Definitely not... If I can find it online for free you can probably do the same if you put your heart into it and actually research the movie and don't believe other reviewers that state this is the best saw movie ever made because it's not. The best saw movie is number one according to ratings. But I did the best I can for my review for saw x 10!!!!!!,2023-09-30
"I am a fan of the Saw franchise and have seen them all. After the death of John Kramer it was all about the kills and the story was totally lost. I'm so happy about this one because of John Kramer and the story it has to tell. It is nice to get a little depth in how he gets his ideas. After the first half you really want the baddies to get hurt. He is true to the first ones as in every ""player"" has a fighting chance. The gore is up to par, but especially loved more story. Saw some of the plot twists coming, but that didn't ruin my experience. Better than the previous sequels, give it a watch and enjoy! Hope they make more inbetweners like this one 😉",2023-10-19
"Meh, it was better than a lot of the sequels, but of course it was never going to top the first couple.It gives you a lot of what you ask for out of a Saw film. But what I loved the most about the first couple of films is that it wasn't just stringing people up in traps, it had a sense of crime/mystery to it as well, and that's something that these films lost over the years.They began to focus too much on the gore and trap elements that they forgot to tie in an interesting narrative to go along with them.The first half of this film was pretty decent, but it did start to dwindle a bit, and the 'happily ever after' ending seemed a bit incongruous.Wouldn't feel compelled to revisit this one. If I ever rewatch the Saw films I only ever do the first 3 or 4.Farewell, John Kramer. Hopefully they don't feel compelled to carry on the franchise, because we know it won't be the same without Jigsaw.",2023-10-21
"I have yet to see all of the Saw movies. I've seen the original, Saw 2 (apparently, but I don't remember anything about it) and Spiral. I went to see Saw X because I heard good things about it.Saw X is pretty good, but not perfect. The plot is pretty compelling, but I think the baggage of the franchise sort of put a hamper on the story. Imagine taking the same story, but it's the first Saw film you've seen. I think that would've been far more interesting. Everyone in the audience already knows that John Kramer is the Jigsaw Killer, but what if that was the twist to the story?Anyway, enough ruminating on hypotheticals. Let's judge the movie by what it actually is. Spoilers from here on out.The kill on the poster was wasted, honestly. It was by far the most creative of the kills but making it a daydream where Kramer watches a hospital cleaner steal from a patient before then changing his mind was disappointing. I understand why they did it. It puts us in Kramer's perspective, a man who knows he's dying, and considering what he wants to do with the rest of his life. But the fact that it happens to no one of consequence is just...ehThen we get to the big set piece. The group of scammers who pretended to give Kramer surgery only to take his money and run. Making the victims of the 'Games' this unlikeable was a pretty smart decision, considering that Kramer is the protagonist of the film as opposed to his usual role as the villain. The lead scammer is especially entertaining to watch as she eggs on the others to complete their games, revealing at the end that she wanted them to die so she could keep all the money. That was clever.The one person I think didn't belong there was Gabriela. The rest of the team of scammers played crucial roles in the scam, pretending to be doctors, nurses, other patients etc. But Gabiela was just...there? She didn't really do anything except say ""yeah the lead scammer doctor, she's good I guess"". I mean, sure, she lied to Kramer, but compared to the others she didn't deserve to be in the games at all.Again, I haven't seen all of the Saw films, so I'm guessing there's more egregious examples of 'victims of Saw that in no way deserved to be', but Gabriela is up there IMO. I will say her 'game' was the second most creative of the lot, or at the very least most visually interesting.Overall this film was a fun watch. I need to catch up on the rest of the franchise now.",2023-10-09
"No one but him knows what kind of things a man who lives with artistic and artistic vision will be inspired by, and likewise a man who has the intention of murder!. In this way, when ""John Kramer"" approaches the country of ""Mexico"" for treatment in this film, he is inspired by a new strategy of taking life through the statue of ancient ""Tlaloc"" and the scene is amazing! ""Tlaloc"" Aztec rain god statue. Representations of the rain god wearing a strange mask, with large round eyes and long fangs date back at least to the Teotihuacan culture of the highlands (3rd to 8th century AD). In the cult of Tlaloc, the Aztecs would offer him human sacrifices, usually children. As with many sacrifices, children are ripped from their chests while their hearts are still beating. When the character John Kramer, who is a giant, pleads for his life, we, the audience, feel sorry for him, forgetting the atrocities he has committed before! While there are usually many reasons given to justify killing in the ""Saw"" movies, I'd say the best writing in this story is John Kramer's emotional murders justified by the tragedies and betrayals in his personal life!",2023-10-21
"I admit, I was very skeptical towards this movie, I deeply hated ""Jigsaw"", I consider it the worst of the saga, and I find ""Spiral"" a nice spin off but nothing more, so today, having reached a tenth chapter I asked myself ""But what's the point?"" ""what else does this franchise have to say""???Well, Saw X has demonstrated great maturity, yes because it is a very touching and intelligent film.The first part, focused on John's illness, destroyed me, as I am a very hypochondriac, every time we talk about illnesses I am very impressed and this film tells the drama of sick people in a very realistic way.Then we get to the second part and the game begins and...wow, the new Jigsaw game is among the most brutal and ferocious of the saga, a scene, I admit, bothered me for its high level of sadism, the final twist it's not the most surprising, but it actually suits the story told in this film.To conclude, I would like to spend a few words on the interpretation of Tobin Bell, a masterful interpretation, it is a shame that Bell is so underrated, he is truly very good, he has an icy gaze that freezes the blood and at the same time he manages to give very empathetic and suffering expressions that make you they tighten the heart, so Bell is a truly very versatile actor, but today we prefer to give Oscars to Top Gun 2 or Barbie.....",2023-10-30
"Honestly this movie was absolutely fantastic. Both serving as a direct sequel to the very first Saw, but also an origin story for John Kramer himself. It was everything I had hoped for and more, it did not disappoint. The return of Amanda was also a very nice addition, but also necessary for the story being told. Saw X is basically Saw 2 within the timeline.The story was beautifully done and I felt the relationship between Amanda and John rather touching. The dynamic was there and portrayed perfectly.I feel like this movie has been a long time coming given how the franchise was going, Spiral was nothing more than a disappointment in my view, and Chris Rock shouldn't be allowed to touch the Saw franchise again.You don't need to have seen any of the others for this to make sense to you other than the very first, but this is for both newcomers to the franchise and those of us who have been around for some time.The post credit scene was also a joy, it was great to see Hoffman back even if it was for a small scene. But this was clearly setting up for another movie to follow on from Saw X and I cannot wait to see what that may be.Easily a 10/10 from me. If you're yet to see it, then please do enjoy. You'll love every second of it, I sure did.",2023-09-29
"The best things about sequels in franchises is watching your favorite characters on screen again. Amanda Young's return to the SAW franchise sure made me watch the movie. People think that saw is all about gore but for me, it has always been about ethics.Would you want a criminal to be sawed in half because he wronged you? That's the question. Before watching this film, sadly, I had to watch the unimpressive prequel called 'Spiral'. And I was tuning in expecting disappointment but this Saw X brought in the original flavour of the franchise and enthrilled me.I'm excited to have seen more of John Kramer's character. This film takes its time to unfold, builds up slowly, connects all dots and finishes. I didn't particulary like the ending ethic but still the movie is impactful.You also get answers to your questions as to why Amanda Young turned into an unapolegetic nightmare later in the series. Saw X also explores the dynamic between her character and John Kramer. I'm glad that the film had more to offer than I expected and I recommend this to SAW fans.It is the best one after Saw and Saw II.Vetrrich Chelvan

"Slicing into cinemas for its 10th instalment Saw X turns the gears back to when the Jigsaw Killer's crusade against the wicked was gathering steam.Taking place between Saw 1 & 2, John Kramer (Tobin Bell) seeks vengeance against the con-artists who tricked him into believing they cured his brain cancer. For a series too often overindulged in torture, gore and questionable at best stories, I was delighted to see Saw X return the spotlight to Bell, a character whose iconic presence and performance is simply unmatched. If you dig through all the blood and guts in this latest entry (and trust me there is a lot), you're likely to find a little heart hidden underneath as Kramer's human side and moral code are given some depth for once.Saw wouldn't be Saw without some delicious deadly traps and this latest game delivers gallons. Going back to the classic grindhouse aesthetic that made the original so memorable, the atmosphere surrounding these new abominations perfectly complement the bloodshed, guaranteed to make even those with an iron stomach wince. Saw fans or anyone in the odd mood for some bloody carnage and even the return of Billy the Puppet will be satisfied.",2023-09-30
"First things first, I'm a big fan of the SAW franchise and all the characters linked with it. This is my favourite horror franchise of all time. Saw X is easily one of the best sequels in the franchise and it ranks among one of my top favourite Saw movies.Seeing John Kramer, played by Tobin Bell, is the real appeal of this movie. He lends so much heart, shade and range of his emotions to his character and the story along with Amanda, it's just a big treat for Saw fans. He truly feels like a protagonist, though I always believed him to be so, who has been wronged and he has set out to reawaken his wrong-doers. The movie is more about the human side of John Kramer than being of the legendary teacher Jigsaw, so Billy is sidelined in this movie and only has a short screen time but it is Tobin who has acted his heart out for this one.Speaking about the traps of the movie. Some of them are so brutal, gory, and nerve-wracking, it's really hard to see even for hardcore Saw fans. But most of them stand out to be unique and in line with the theme of the movie. I bet it will be a hard time for almost all the viewers watching them. Also, the soundtrack of the movie by the veteran, Charlie Clouser is ever-expanding, heartfelt and at the same time rocking as Saw movie deserves.This sequel/prequel is not like other movies in the franchise. It has a lot of things going for it. The direction, cinematography, soundtrack, etc., all are back to make it feel like a 2000s Saw movie but at the same time it feels new and like a movie set in modern days. It also pays some homages to previous Saw movies. The twist of the movie can be a little underwhelming but what preceded it was shocking and has never been done before in the franchise yet. The screenplay has also been amped up than the previous Saw movies, it feels more like a complete movie in itself with a beautiful ending.Just as much as this movie depicts a personal story of John Kramer battling his cancer, it feels as personal to a loyal Saw fan to witness him suffer. He stands out among all, even though other characters were pretty good too. I loved the Hoffman cameo in the post-credit scene. Good to see him again too.It was one of my precious moments of life to watch and live a Saw movie in a theatre, Saw X was my first one of the franchise and I had a wonderful time watching it. The SAW horror movies and their immortal characters will always be dear to me. I thank everyone involved in the making of this film for letting us, the fans, witness the glory of Saw movies once again just like the old days.So, yeah, every horror fan and, definitely, every SAW fan should see SAW X, it's one of the most thrilling, bloody, and emotional horror movies of the year. SAW X is much more than just GAME OVER!",2023-09-28
"Yes! Yes! Yes! They finally did it! The best Saw movie since the very beginning of the franchise. John Kramer is back, not for retribution, but to awaken the bad guys and gals, anf this time you will be rooting for Kramer and his protegé, Amanda while ask some ruthless and heartless conmen to make their choice: live or die?! This time his moralcodex is excactly where it's supposed to be.For the first time since the original I feel that the franchise is back on track, and I'm hoping that they will continue on this track. The ending of Saw X gives us hope for arleast one more installment. I want more from this Saw crew.",2023-10-09
"Like many modern horror films, Saw X uses the first 30-40 minutes of its 2 hour run time to set up John Kramer's (Tobin Bell) story. You wouldn't notice that it was a horror movie but for a clever scene which comes as a bit of a surprise given the marketing for the film.However, once the games begin, it's as gruesome as ever. This is certainly not for the feint hearted! The games are terrifying. The series massively benefits from being set after the original SAW and having John Kramer on screen for the majority of the film. We witness the story through his eyes and his character brings the atmosphere, moral dilemmas and stoicism that the series is about. The would be victims play their part in making Saw X a gripping watch with a range of personalities from frightened to defiant. The film also manages to briefly touch on the issue of Big Pharma and alternative medicine along the way.Those familiar with the SAW franchise may be able to predict parts of the third act and whilst I do question some of the choices made by the characters it was still an enjoyable watch.Overall Saw X was a strong return to form aided by a straight forward plot told through the eyes of John Kramer, insane traps and fun dialogue. Recommended to SAW/Horror fans and absolutely do not recommend to anybody that can't stomach blood, gore, injury or violence :)",2023-10-04
"Okay I watched it yesterday in the cinema and to be honest, I really enjoyed it! To be fair, after Jigsaw and Spiral I wasn't expecting much, maybe that's why I'm so amazed right now. The movie was really fun, the plot twist actually got me, I didn't expect it at all! For me, it's the best one since the second movie (ofc Saw II is the best one tho haha). The acting was good, the traps were really brutal this time, like really. I haven't been this disgusted at a Saw movie trap in a long time and I LOVED it!!! I totally recommend the movie if you're a Saw fan, if you're not, the movie is made in a way you understand what's goin' on even without watching the others, so you'll enjoy it! Probably one of the best horrors this year!",2023-10-22
"As a fan of the original I must say that for me this is a worthy addition to the series. The relationship between John & Amanda still works and even sheds light on how they were early on. Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith absolutely provide the heart & soul of this chapter. And I enjoyed the twisted end: what a beautiful double-cross.I cannot understand the bashing some people are giving in reviews here other than it seems horror films are never deemed worthy of any positive praise. Some folks don't seem to understand that Hollywood's main job is to suspend your reality for the duration of your viewing. Nothing created by humans will never be 100% perfect as humans are fallible, wake up to that already. Although, my opinion is that this one is very near as perfect as the original.",2023-10-30
"I had very low expectations for Saw X, mainly because the horror genre has been lacking the magic of what it should be. I'm finally happy to see films like this getting back to what the term HORROR is. Frankly there's been a lack of good horror films in the past decade. Nowadays they tend to be your typical tacky cliché jumpscares gimmick with annoying loud banging sound and mainly focusing on cheap demon/ ghost filth "" the conjuring, paranormal activity and those dreadful insidious films. Finally, Saw X takes it back to the roots of pure horror because humans are the one that you should be scared of.",2023-10-01
"Saw X is a cinematic masterpiece that reignites the franchise's signature elements in a fresh and captivating manner. I would wholeheartedly give this movie a 9-star rating, and the only reason I'm removing one star is due to a slight hint of predictability.From the moment the opening scene unfolds, Saw X grips you tightly and refuses to let go. The return of Jigsaw, the mastermind behind the iconic series, is nothing short of electrifying. Tobin Bell's portrayal of the character is as chilling as ever, and his presence on screen sends shivers down your spine.The plot, which is both intricate and engaging, takes you on a rollercoaster ride of suspense and psychological thrills. The ingenious traps and moral dilemmas presented in the movie are not only horrifying but also thought-provoking. They challenge the characters' wits and morality, leaving you on the edge of your seat, eagerly anticipating the outcome.The character development in Saw X is commendable. The cast delivers exceptional performances, and the new additions to the story bring a fresh perspective to the long-running saga. The film also revisits some familiar faces, providing a satisfying continuity for fans of the franchise.The production quality is top-notch, with the signature gritty and gruesome visuals that have become a hallmark of the Saw series. The score and sound design intensify the atmosphere, making each scene more gripping and immersive.Now, as for the minor setback - predictability. Given the extensive history of the Saw franchise, avid fans may recognize certain patterns or anticipate some plot twists. However, it's important to note that this is a challenge that many long-running series face. Despite this minor issue, the film's overall execution more than compensates for it.In conclusion, Saw X is a remarkable addition to the iconic horror series. With its clever storyline, strong performances, and relentless suspense, it keeps you hooked throughout. While a hint of predictability might deter the most die-hard fans, it's a minor blemish on an otherwise flawless cinematic experience. Saw X is a must-watch for anyone who loves horror, suspense, and a masterfully crafted story.",2023-10-21
"One of the things I appreciate about the movie is the players of the game actually having the will to live. In prior movies, they're always so incompetent and its just a bit painful to watch. Another thing is most of the saw movies are on the shorter side but the fact this one has that extra 20+ minutes really makes a difference for me. The pacing is actually really enjoyable and I found myself liking the slower feel this movie had. Rather than jumping straight into a game, there was quite a bit of build up that made the actual game feel a lot more significant. Honestly this is one of my (if not the) favorite saw movies in the franchise.",2023-09-30
"I have always wanted to give a chance to the next franchise instalments and I'm glad I did. For me, this one even surpassed the first one. Loved that we had to see John's journey throughout this movie, watching how simple of a man he is when you act like you supposed to do in life, and what happens when you choose to walk through your life over bones of a human decency. Saw X brings something that other instalments didn't, a closer look into John's life and that is part of what makes this movie one of the best Saw instalments.I can simply and wholeheartedly recommend this jewel of a movie. Tobin Bell once again proofs why he is Jigsaw. Through his traps we see how big of a human he is and what happens when you cross him. Choose wisely, I know I did!",2023-10-20
"The difference between the original saw and the rest is the original saw is written like a book, the rest is written like a movie. The rest of the saws are made with the perspective of an outsider, it's like being taken around a jigsaw puzzle tour. Saw one though, everything is setup to provide the viewer a toolbox of imagination, the first question you ask when the game takes place what and why are we in this room, what and why is this dead body on the floor and more. You are no longer on a jigsaw puzzle tour, you are participating in the puzzle and actively trying to solve it as the puzzles.",2023-10-22
"I've seen every movie in the Saw franchise. I would say that this (despite the obvious age difference of Amanda and John) not only fits well in the lore, but was actually a compelling story. This isn't a story about some protégé, or story that takes place in the Saw universe. John Cramer/Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is front and center here, and does an excellent job. I would say that this is probably the best one they've done since Saw 2. 3 had its moments, but the Jeff storyline didn't work for me. The others had their moments too, but with some exceptions, they ultimately got progressively worse. I hope the success with the audience on this entry, doesn't lead to more entries, unless they can make more that are at least as good as this one. However, the history of this franchise tells me, that isn't likely.",2023-10-26
"Amazing! What a movie. The story-line is amazing. Even if someone hasn't watched all the previous SAW movies he/she can go and watch this. It's really difficult to make a good part of any movie but SAW has done it again with its 10th part. As we all know that SAW is not a horror movie but rather a thriller movie with gruesome scenes, so, this part delivers that. It has gruesome scenes but also a good story-line so someone who is not really a fan of such scenes should avoid watching this movie. It can be argued that this part (SAW X) might be the best one so far. The acting, the story and everything else just fits the shoes of Jigsaw's story.",2023-10-01
"This was better than the last three Saw films. It Is easily one of the most cohesive films in the franchise. The motives for Jigsaw are clear and this film actually makes the audience root for him. The traps in this film are gruesome and are filmed in a way that makes one want to look away but also keep watching. I enjoyed the simplicity of the story without the excessive flashbacks or the convoluted number of characters that are made to tie with one another. It reminded me of the simplicity of the very first film. There wasn't a boring moment in the film and it was great having John Kramer at the center as he should have been all along.The only negative I have is that having seen all the other films made the twist in this film very mediocre. There comes a point where you just know what's going to happen and it takes away from the suspence that was building up all along. With that said I felt the ending was the weakest part of the film and a bit of a cop out. However, this is still a good film and it does uplift the franchise and gives audiences something to look forward to.",2023-10-12
"This movie is EASILY one of my favorite movies in the Saw franchise. I have been rewatching the whole series, and this one is my favorite along with the OG and the second. I had medium-low expectations, since its a newer movie, and sometimes newer movies in franchises can suck sometimes. Although when i watched this movie, i hadnt seen any other saw movies than the first and second, and a bit of the third. Now I have seen all of the movies. This movie was good and it had an interesting plot that was easy to follow along. I DID have some questions though. One of them is, why does John Kramer even care about his cancer at this point? He's been very sickly since the first movie, and hes also been elderly, so he should be greatful that he's lived this long, because living approx 20 years with bad cancer is very miraculous, especially at the stage and severity of his cancer. Another question i had is, how did he make all these contraptions so quick? He is visiting mexico from the US and hasnt had any time after the ""surgery."" Speaking of the supposed surgery that he found out was fake, wouldn't he have felt at least somewhat in pain? How didnt he know that he wasnt ACTUALLY getting a surgery. Even with anesthesia, its still a mystery to me. He wouldve at least felt something post op, even if he was on painkillers that doesnt take the pain away miraculously. I know that it's just a movie and im not supposed to think about these things, but these are just my curiosities!Also i liked seeing amanda, cuz she's kewl.Jigsaw has really became a good guy, cause those doctors got what they deserved.Also, how did that one guy have a surgery scar if it wasnt a real surgery? (Sorry i just thought of that question after losing it in my packed mind lol)
Jigsaw has really become a good guy over the years, he was basically just giving killers and selfish people what they deserve!",2023-10-23
I'm a big fan of the franchise. I just watched 1 hour ago and i loved it. I think its a one of the best movie of the franchise with a deepest storyline of the character of jigsaw and his cancer. We see the main character looking for a cure for his cancer and the story takes place in Mexico . The mexican actors are great. The last movies weren't so good. Because it was a kind of mess but this one is different. I think Spiral was the worst.... Traps are brutals as hell and very imaginatives (Mention special for mateo's trap ) and the end is great. Perfect movie. For the fans go and watch it !!!!,2023-09-28
"It's the second best SAW film in the franchise along with the first film. We should have seen X, after the original SAW, back in 2005, that's what it should be, because it is simply phenomenal. It's Jigsaw's personal story, when it all began, his drama and the start of his trip to vengeance and of course to rectify all of his victims.We finally see A LOT of the protagonist throughout the film and oh my god we needed it so desperately! Tobin Bell is iconic, at least, he simply shines as the brilliant character of Jigsaw and he is of course relentless!! The gore is fantastic, the film doesn't fail there, how could it, it's SAW for the love of god!I really hope there will be a sequel to this, i want Tobin again to be present from start to the end of the film!",2023-10-13
"Although I find myself somewhat, and unfortunately, hardened to horrors these days, this movie had me squirming much to my surprise. Fans of intense visual horror will be in for a treat! The movie begins at a steady pace and builds, forging a convincing storyline, I found myself calling for the much-loved SAW-like visuals to begin...and oh my word, they came and did not disappoint. The effects are faultless, the creativity boundless. The movie delivers in many areas, compassion (oddly), unapologetic violence that SAW fans have so come to love, twists and turns, and more. I left the cinema feeling gorged on SAW visuals and totally satisfied that it was money well spent.",2023-10-09
"Hoping for a miraculous cure, John Kramer travels to Mexico for a risky and experimental medical procedure, only to discover the entire operation is a scam to defraud the most vulnerable. Armed with a newfound purpose, the infamous serial killer uses deranged and ingenious traps to turn the tables on the con artists.Not going to lie, my expectations were low, based off the fact that the previous saw instalments haven't been very up to standards. This movie takes place in between saw 1 & 2, following the life of John Kramer, a cancer patient. Aw X is a refreshing sequel to a franchise that suffered with the previous two instalments as it has a story that puts John Kramer as the centre focus main character. I think that long time fans of Saw will really appreciate this sequel and will definitely be able to enjoy every minute of this movie's runtime. Saw X's start is a key difference to other openings we've seen before in these films as the slower pace sets up what would turn out to be a well-written emotional story. I recommend that everyone watch Saw X either in cinema or on streaming services.",2023-10-27
I was blown away with Saw X amazing writing and acting. I was sitting at the edge of my seat.this is what you call a saw film. NOT jigsaw or Spiral this is my favourite sequel now love it. Tobin Bell does a phenomenal job of playing John for the ninth time. And great seeing Amanda back yet you could see she had aged and a bad wig. Tobin has hardly aged but that could be put down to the fact he's dying. I wish they never killed him off in Saw III he had so much potential for another film like this one ore two more then kill him off.but I do love the flashbacks. Hope everyone enjoyed it very much.,2023-10-01
"The second film franchise to reach its tenth instalment this year following Fast X is Saw X/10. I hope we don't get another X this year otherwise that will make XXX and the last thing we need is more Vin Diesel on the big screen.Sax X is the tenth instalment in the Saw Franchise which began in 2004 and last hit the big screen with 2021's Spiral. The new film is set between the first and second instalment and returns to following the work of John Kramer (Tobin Bell) who for those who don't know anything about the Saw Franchise is the lead character and sees himself as Judge, Jury and executioner to those that he feels have done wrong but are yet to be punished for their actions. Also returning is Amanda Young (Shawnee Smith) who's almost like a disciple to John and aids him with his traps.This time around the franchise goes back to its routes and focuses very much on John Kramer in fact I think he's in this film more than any other instalments in the franchise. So much so that if it wasn't for 2017's instalment having been called Jigsaw then that title would have perfectly fit this film. Whilst the film is returning to its routes with Kramer, it also differs from the rest of the franchise as this film tells its story chronologically where as most of the previous entry's start with the victims in traps and use flash backs to tell the audience why they're there. I appreciate this quite significant change but I will say it does mean that the film takes a good 30/40 mins to get going however stick with it because it's for good reason. In here we get to learn more about the John Kramer than perhaps we have in any of the previous instalments. We get more of an insight into his mind and to the why and how he comes up with these elaborate torture devices. This is a big plus for me as since the second film we haven't had much character development and a lot of the characters had started to feel like merely meat for the grinder so to speak.Whilst I have nothing against the 'torture porn' (after all who doesn't like a bit of BDSM) that the franchise is known for you can't build a whole film just off of that like some of the previous instalments have done.While we are on the subject thought let's talk about the traps and gore and I'm happy to say that If that's what you mainly want from a saw film I think you'll also be in for a treat. Whilst after 10 films it's going to be hard to make traps that are completely unique there are some unique ideas that lead to grisly consequences for the victims. One in particular made me feel a little light headed, I won't spoil it but I will just say the word thigh.As for the victims, I don't want to talk about why they're in the traps so much as you should experience the film for yourself with that being said it does make you bring into question your own moral code as these are some pretty disgusting individuals and you may just find yourself wanting them to die.I think the most controversial element of this film will be the ending and yeah to be honest it wasn't quite as satisfying as I feel it could have been. It is however a very small gripe for a film that is a solid entry in the saw franchise and has something for everyone.",2023-10-01
"I have to admit I was pretty sceptic about the 10th movie from ""Saw"" franchise. The last one was the worst and I had the feeling that this legendary movie franchise has reached the end of it.Kevin Greutert was back as the director and Tobin Bell is back as the John Cramer. We all know that from a certain stage all ""Saw"" movies upgraded their gore and try to make their adult audience to vomit as quick as they can.Well...this one is doing a pretty good job at that. Almost un-watchable scenes which you cannot believe someone has thought about writing or directing. The narrative and storytelling got the famous twist instead the big ending-shocker.This time Cramer is finally the main character in his own game and almost telling the story himself. It is refreshing after watching almost each variant of trying to tell play this game nine times before this one sets.It is not the best film from this film franchise, but it is totally meeting the high standards and vision which James Wan and Leigh Whannell had almost 20 years ago.Though it was almost unbearable to watch, sometimes, it was a pleasure to meet the double morality of Cramer and see him, for the first time, as the main character and almost hero.""How the tables have turned"" is a sentence you'll find yourself saying more then once, during the watching in this movie. It is well directed and almost perfectly acted, by the Veterans of the cast.Hard to believe to both main characters, which are supposed to be 20 years younger then how they look in the movie, but for this we can compromise.It is a fan service and a movie which totally resurrects the franchise and maybe in another decade he will be able to celebrate a Bar Mitzvah with the kids of his old fan base.",2023-10-28
"This is a genuinely good movie.Not mediocre(at best) franchise fare.The production values seem pretty high for this kind of movie. Although it's limited locations it's a solid production.The script is well written. The acting is good.It is by far the most grisly and violent Saw movie made.There's some scenes where it gets really intense. There are scenes with that combo of terror and violence that go really hard.Now, the set up is long. A good length of film. I think that has brought the imdb rating down because alot of people will feel the set up is too long.But it is never boring.Personally, I like the long set up because it gives to the film some substance and makes the second half of the film more compelling.But I can understand why some horror fans won't like the long setup.Now, personally there are some problems with this whole movie.John Kramer is the protagonist.I have seen the Saw movies thru the 4th one.The motivation of John Kramer has always been an interesting one. And fairly unique to an extent.But he was always the villain. We could appreciate the ambiguity of his motivation and action but it was always ultimately wrong. At the end of the day.This movie really takes John Kramer's side very strongly. He is the main character. He is portrayed as right. The movie sides with his methods, at least partially.Regardless of that, it is a good movie.",2023-10-23
"As you may already know the favorite movie of the franchise was the first one but not anymore... This movie was something else can't even describe what I felt while I was watching it. That script,those actings,the traps all of 'em was a MASTERPIECE. Guys whatever you do see this movie on cinema while you still can. I've seen all of the movies in the franchise several times but the traps are way much better and has way more violent. The one who amazes us with his intelligence is showing his intelligent part in an unexpected moment which was so stressfull. Hope y'all will see it on cinema and youl'll experience this.",2023-10-01
"""Saw X"" marks a commendable entry into the enduring and iconic horror franchise. While it may not attain the heights of the earlier films, it still manages to captivate viewers with its blend of grotesque traps and narrative intrigue.The film smartly reintroduces some familiar characters, which not only adds a layer of nostalgia but also serves to deepen the overall story arc. Longtime fans of the series will appreciate the effort made to connect the dots within the Saw universe. It's clear that the filmmakers aim to reward those who have followed the series from its inception.One of the standout aspects of ""Saw X"" is, unsurprisingly, the inventive and gruesome traps. These macabre devices continue to be the centerpiece of the franchise, and this installment doesn't disappoint in that regard. The sheer creativity behind these setups, as well as the visceral and visceral reactions they provoke, are what the Saw movies are known for, and they deliver in spades here.However, the film is not without its flaws. Some plot elements feel somewhat recycled from previous installments, and at times, it becomes evident that the franchise's formulaic approach to storytelling is showing signs of fatigue. Additionally, the pacing, while generally effective, could have been tighter in certain segments.In conclusion, ""Saw X"" manages to strike a balance between nostalgia and fresh content, offering an entertaining and, at times, shocking experience for fans of the series. While it may not reinvent the wheel, it remains a solid entry that delivers on the core elements that have made Saw a horror staple. If you're a long-time fan or just someone looking for a gruesome thrill, this installment is worth the watch and deserves an 8/10 rating.",2023-09-29
"After a decline in the 2000s, along with 2 latest sequels/spin offs that did not work well. The franchise returns to its origins, thanks to the direction of Kevin Greutert.The film takes its time to introduce us to the main plot, unlike its predecessors, where we used to follow 2 story lines that intersected each other. In this one we will only follow the story of John Kramer, who is the protagonist of this interquel.Among the good points, I highlight Greutert's direction, which recovers that gloomy and dirty atmosphere of the first 3 films. The performances of Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith were well done, which helped a lot to see the bond between their characters, who share emotional moments. Without forgetting the excellent practical effects with digital retouching, which together provide fans with bloody and tense moments very well achieved.In weak points, there are several very convenient script holes. The theme of morality that the film deals with may be questionable for many viewers. This makes act 3 decline a little, but it still leaves a good note.Highly recommended, this is easily the best sequel the franchise has released.",2023-09-29
"If you love the SAW franchise, you will definitely appreciate this movie. You get John Kramer back as jigsaw from his POV. In this movie he was already jigsaw and was mentoring Amanda so you can say this timeline was right before 2. I want to say they had John as the protagonist but more of a vigilante. This movie wasn't just about the blood, guts and crazy traps that rips people apart. The storyline was well written. At one point you can see John happy and rips up a piece of paper like he's done with all this. I enjoy all SAW but some got repetitive when Hoffman was playing Jigsaw jr. You do get the typical blood and annihilated bodies from Jigsaws trap but it has a good storyline behind it. Very nice to see Tobin and Amanda back to reprise their roles. Having Jigsaw actually performing his made traps in real time and on the go within the movie was something new and it felt refreshing and nostalgic at the same time, especially when the theme music hit. IMO this could very well be the best of all the SAW movies within the franchise with 10 and going. You would actually think, after having all these saw movies coming out almost every year up until the last one that people would think this franchise is exhausted and outstayed its welcome.They did right by the fans with this new installment of SAW. Something the fans definitely can appreciate. My wife and I saw it in the afternoon and she was glad she rewatch the first 3 because she really never paid attention but she loves the franchise now. I am sure future SAW movies will have cameos from long time characters from the original or within the earlier timeline. Just like how it took 9 saw movies for us to finally see what ever happened to the doctor that cut off his leg from the first movie. Going back to the first SAW, it only edges Saw X due to the ending. That first ending was epic. How John was in that room the whole time without them touching or think of check on a body that looked dead. I am sure 99% of us would have never predicted that ending and if you are the 1%, i would call you a liar. Lol....
Overall a great SAW movie with past characters back to play their roles was awesome. If you never seen or gotten into this franchise, it's good enough to enjoy as a stand alone. This movie was a special treat for us Jigsaw fans. It even makes you wonder if a Jigsaw really did exist in this world that there would really be a lot of people cheering for him. It is a disturbing thought but story was good enough to get you thinking that way.Much respect to Tobin bell because the man is in his 80s still going strong and giving us another great jigsaw movie. If you love this franchise and give it no less than 9, you aren't fans of this franchise. It is an easy 9 or 10 for me. 10 installments is a lot because any franchise that makes it thus far is special.",2023-10-05
"I was super lucky to see this opening day in Canada, and being a HUGE fan of the Saw franchise, I was super excited for this movie (I also got the Billy cup lmao).This movie met my expectations! To me, the first few minutes of the movie felt a bit robotic in a way? (Probably not the word I'm looking for) But other than that, the traps were absolutely exciting, terribly gory, and nerve-wracking. We got all these amazing traps, while also getting to see a more human side of John and Amanda, which I'm super glad for.Also, I'm taking a moment to point out Octavio Hinojosa. His character was my absolute favorite, and his acting was phenomenal :DOverall, this was a GREAT movie in the franchise, and I hope we get to see another Saw movie in the future that just as, if not better, than this one!!",2023-09-30
"I'm a huge fan of horror flicks and gore. John Kramer stars this one and what is fascinating about him is no matter how vindictive he is, you will stand by him. He's not really evil; he's just smart, patient and fair.I was expecting this release to be a bit far-fetched, but little did I know. The beginning is a bit slow, but once you think everything will be fine is when the real stuff begins. Kramer is not the type of guy you can fool, oh no.In the second half is when the real action starts accelerating and you will be glued to your seat. As in the previous releases, everything will be explained in flashbacks by the end.This film has some sudden twists and Kramer has a chance to show that he's not really evil. Go to the theater and watch this one!",2023-09-30
"After the total train-wreck that was Spiral, absolutely nobody was interested by another Saw sequel starring Marty the Zebra from Madagascar, but what a surprise! This tenth installment of this franchise is without Marty and focuses on Jigsaw himself instead, and it's worth an arm and a leg for! (Ticket prices...)The movie's biggest strength is building up and establishing characters to the eventual traps rather than throwing them in your face. Tobin Bell gives his best performance in this franchise to date his age might not fit with the franchise's timeline but it adds to the frailty of his character. The traps here are superb, boosted by the urge to finish off these wicked people ALTHOUGH I did have an issue with some of them being practically impossible due to the time limit or inconvenience of the characters surviving. Performances are acceptable but I did have an issue with Shawnee Smith's acting in some parts though.Overall, a solid, if forgettable horror fare thats better than most of its kind. The ending might not be as satisfying as one may expect but its surprising amount of heart to go along with the gore might win some non fans over. Check this one out, must-see for avid Saw fans.",2023-10-21
"This is an excellent sidequel.Its meant to fit between 1 and 2.However there is a big big pothole that was established in Saw 6.In That film he makes his Medical insurer ""play a Game"". It's due to the fact that they will not fund or even allow John kramer to go to Norway, or Europe somewhere, for experimental procedure. They even threaten to cancel his account and force Kramer to pay all the medical bills. In the US it can be very expensive to treat cancer.But in Saw X he's allowed to go to Mexico for this ""New"" treatment with no problem from his medical insurance issues.But if you Overlook the basic plot of Saw VI it's a brilliant but a different type of Saw film.",2023-11-01
"Just have seen SAW X in the theaters. What a bloody movie! Not gonna lie, i had to take my hands sometimes before my eyes. But... i like the movie. Story line is good. Nice build-up what most horror movies are missing these days. It felt realistic. Second, the lead actor was good. I am not sure if he plays all the jigsaw movies because i did not see them all.What did suprise me is that the ''victems'' did not had to walk arround some old building but instead they just stayed the whole time in the same room. It was good.. and probely refreshing but i like to see them move arround a bit. But thats probely my personal desire.Ending was good also. Not really suprising but still decent.All by all; a nice 7.",2023-10-29
"This movie was interesting. I think all of us know that, for the most part, Saw is going to be one gore kill after another, and there will be some minor plot. Well, this time the plot is actually all over the movie, pretty much from start to finish. I'm not sure how to describe it, but the movie was REALLY good. Not just splatter. I'll move on from this!At first, you figure out that you are seeing a prequel to the whole franchise, but then along the away you figure out that this happens sometime between part 3 and 4 (I think) because you see characters who are dead already. That was the fun part of it!!I think on balance, it was the most entertaining movie in the entire series. Of course, you can never replace Saw 1 as the master of the series, but this was just easy to watch, and I believe the kills didn't over take the entire movie.I actually hate to say this, but I'm not sure I follow the end. (The end before the credits start, then there's more after the credits.) I'm going to research this and see what other people think. You'll get it when you see it.See it. It'll fill in a few blanks!",2023-10-30
"This movie was GREAT!!!!In this film you get another great background into Johns life...
I felt bad for John and I was rooting for him and his traps in this film.... The people going through the traps all deserved what they had coming to them...
Amanda coming back to be in this film is great. The connection between the two of them you see again just like you do in the third film..
I didn't give it higher than a 7 because I do feel like the traps were a little boring compared to some of the ones we have seen in the rest of the series of films. They definitely focused more on the story and Johns pain than the traps themselves.Amanda also definitely looks older in this film (obviously) so that kind of messes up to me since this is supposed to be between the first and 2nd film.Stay after the credits start to roll for a nice little tid bit featuring one of the hated men in SAW.All in all it's a great film to see and definitely better than Spiral mess.",2023-09-30
"Let's start with the basic stuff:1. Saw X takes place between Saw I and II
2. Established characters, Amanda and hints of Hoffman return.3. The traps return in gruesome fashion.Now, the more complicated part of the movie is that it provides a revenge factor that adds an edgy element and it turns out rather well.Because this is the 10th movie in the franchise, you may be a bit disappointed if you've been there from jump. The ending is not all that special. The twist is kinda so so and easy to see coming. Since this takes place between Saw I and II, we obviously know our anti-heroes aren't going anywhere.The traps are pretty good but like any Saw movie, they really never take into account a body going into shock and freezing up/passing out when that much physical trauma is placed on a human body. That's a bit of an eye roller here.One irksome thing that no one has mentioned is that Amanda returns, but they did absolutely zero anti-aging or makeup adjustments to her. She was supposed to be a young woman in her 20s between Saw I and Saw II. Shawnee Smith looks great for a 54 year old but it definitely shows here and they did so many closeups and zoom angles with her. It's a little insulting to the die hard fans. That little bit threw me off the entire movie. Same with Costas Mandylor. He looks older in his brief glimpse and it seems the producers didn't give two craps about it.Those gaffes lower it down to a 7/10. While the story adds to the overall canon, it doesn't do anything more for the series outside of filling in a gap that no one really had any questions about to begin with so hopefully the next movie doesn't fill in more blanks with unnecessary canon fluff. Saw X stays gritty but adds little to nothing special to the canon.",2023-10-17
"I cant say that it was the best saw movie since the first one but it was still good. The acting of Tobin was so so so good, spot on! Bloody, gory, and everything a Saw movie should be. At the beginning i didnt like the start of the film because it didnt feel like a Saw movie. But when i saw the plot twist where they actually didnt perform the surgery i immediately changed my mind, it was good. I really liked the plot twist. When it comes to the traps i didn't enjoy them very much. The first Eye vacuum trap i would prefer if it actually happened. The bone marrow trap was very very nice, the best one. The pipe bomb trap was kinda okay but still meh. The brain surgery trap was good. The radiation therapy trap not good. The blood waterboarding trap i also didn't like. The burning gas chamber trap was also meh, didn't like that one either. But the movie was good! Not the best, but still enjoyable.",2023-10-30
"Back to vintage Saw! Highly recommend seeing the movie at cinemas, great cinematography, high in gore and solid acting and plot, the movie is set between saw and saw 2 and explains Johns journey in between, if you are a fan of the series this will take you back to its roots and Tobin Bell (John Kramer) being bought back in as the main character throughout the movie is what the franchise needed at this point especially after the previous release (Spiral) in my opinion, you don't need to be a horror buff or Saw fan to enjoy this but you will need be able to watch some gory scenes and not be queasy.",2023-09-29
"While the direction/production on Saw X attempted to capture continuity with the original through the use of color and film, the writing failed on one major front. See, Saw X is a prequel to Saw and yet the complexity of the ""tests"" in part X are completely disconnected from part I. In the original, we run through the paces for an extended period of time for a guy to eventually muster up the strength to saw off his own leg as he is chained to a pipe (or something). That's it...that's the test. Suddenly, all sequels suddenly have this overly elaborate tests using contraptions that would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to build. Saw X is no different. The tests are over-the-top in comparison to Saw, and it loses all continuity for me. On all other fronts it's really well done, but that one right there is a doozy and looses some stars in my opinion.",2023-10-09
"It isn't quite the return to form we were promised. It doesn't quite feel like an early Saw film. Instead, Saw X focuses heavily on John Kramer, and he takes the lead instead of the lead being someone involved in the traps.The story takes a little longer than I hoped to get going, but once it takes off, it is quite a fun and cringe-inducing ride.But the good is that the traps are memorable, and Jigsaw is back baby!! Also the editing is frenetic and reminiscent of the originals without being as over the top as the originals.The twist at the end is sufficient, but not mind-bending. It's not so much a twist, actually. But I can't expand on that without spoilers. So just go see it. It will please fans! Stay for the credits too.",2023-10-01
"The new saw is reasonable.You'll see things you'll like, you'll see things you won't like, you'll see things that aren't even remotely credible (and I'm not even talking about the challenges)Half of the film has a paradisiacal aura - everything goes well, everything seems incredible, everything is too good to be true. You start to speculate where the error is - is it really that easy? Is that character really friendly? And the scenario?It's all very strange, but at the same time it all seems credible.Until it isn't.The simple desire to offer something to someone who had treated him so well leads John to discover the reality of that scenario: a scam.This leads him on an incessant quest to ""restore justice"" and fight against those who defrauded him.Here the games begin.In this second part everything has a macabre effect, of physical and psychological terror, with blood, money, conversations, games and challenges... But everything is as expected for the genius John. Everything predictable.Until it turns out that there are more characters in the story, who can rewrite the end.Of course, knowing from the outset the time space he occupies in the franchise, we know that the protagonist survives... But we wonder how, since something doesn't seem to be in his plans.Finally, the film ends like all the films in the franchise - with a review of the conversations between the characters, indicating what would happen even before it happened - and as predicted by John.",2023-10-30
"How could this movie score a 6.8 instead of a 8 or higher. This was 10/10. I'm a real SAW fan and this.... this movie gives me goosebumps everytime I see it. I have watched the film 3 times in cinema with my mother, friends and alone! The first half is mainly about John and his story about his cancer. I was feeling so so sorry about John and he was so happy when he finds out he was going to heal. The end of the first half he and Amanda kidnapped everybody who were scamming John. Then the pause starts so everybody could prepare for what was coming. That was a really good timing pause! And then the second half was so good. That scene that John speaks with the scamming doctors and said: you promised dying people, DYING people! Gave me goosebumps. Every minute of the film was good. Believe me or not I have watched so many horrors and this was my best horror movie I have ever seen. I'd say again this is a 10/10 and I don't know where that 6.8 is coming from but that is not coming from a real SAW fan.",2023-10-28
"Just left the theater after seeing Saw X and I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed it!My problem with the whole Saw franchise wasn't with the movies themselves, it was the whole convoluted plot line and confusing story that goes back and forth. To this day, I haven't been able to figure out the exact storyline. However, if you are able to let go of wanting continuity, each movie is relatively good as a stand alone piece. I, however, want continuity and have yet to understand the whole ins and outs of the Saw saga.This film doesn't require any of that. It's a stand alone movie and very easy to follow the storyline. The characters all had me engaged as the bad guys had my blood boiling; a sign of great acting! I don't want to elaborate too much as I don't want to give anything away. Just let me say that, with the exception of the first 2 movies, this is by far the best. You don't need any timelines; just sit back and enjoy the movie.I will say, as I mentioned in my headline, the movie was compelling until the last 2 minutes. Let's just say it will leave most viewers frustrated.However, I am happy I saw it (no pun intended) and I think Saw fans will consider this one a long overdue and fairly easy Easter egg to follow.9/10 from me. I have to subtract a point for something viewers will understand once they see the film.",2023-10-05
"Let me be the first to say that I am not a huge fan of Saw movies. I watched the first 3 or 4 films when I was young, I guess I could handle characters being tortured more back then. Through the years it seemed to be focused solely on comically shocking kills and less about a solid plot. However, this film steps away from the convoluted mess that is the last entries and brings it back to basic.I was quite surprised to see this movie doing so well and getting very good feedback and I wanted to see a horror film so it was between this or The Nun II. By the looks of it I chose wisely. I turned away halfway through all of the deaths, but I still had a good time. It is a solid film with a fleshed out story and it is refreshing to see in any series with 10 movies, especially Saw. If you are a hardcore fan I'm sure you will rate it higher.",2023-10-03
"I love every Saw movie, but I know it became a little lesser at the later releases...especially Spiral being one of the least good ones. I went in blind; no expectations. Like I haven't seen any trailers or any info whatsoever. And my god, I was blown away. So much nostalgia , And John actually being on screen MOST of the movie was incredible. I think this is one of the best entries into the franchise.It's nothing like the previous movies where it's super focused on the victims and the traps; its kind of a mixture between that and more emphasis on the story itself. Again, I was blown away. 10 time's the charm i guess.",2023-10-26
"I'm a fan of the Saw Franchise. Yea some of the films can be hit and miss and some of the scenes can be easy to predict but the story telling in the franchise is always great. The way they can switch back to different Saw films and link them without making it confusing is one of its usp's for me.I went into this expecting the usual saw film. The first half hour of the film is very slow. I found myself looking at my watching wondering when the film was gonna 'kick in'. The 2nd half of the film was what I expected a Saw film to be like. The traps are creative, Kramer is more unforgiving in this and there is a lot more blood. I'd recommend giving this a watch if you're a fan of the series.",2023-09-29
"I cannot describe how happy I'm after I watched a new Saw movie!I remember the first one I watched, I was a school kid back then, and it made me admire the main character, his good intentions and BIG brain!From the Saw to Saw X I'm your fan!I watch all of the parts time to time, it's a wonderful flash back into my childhood. I remember how we exchanged DVDs with my classmates!Not many films give me those nice warm feelings and memories!With new Saw X I wasn't disappointed! It made me didn't take my eyes away from TV from start till the end! Each new film I wait with a big passion!I was happy to see John teaching people again!Thank you very much, everyone who has a part in creating this and all other Saws! You are genius, guys!Waiting so much for another perfect product of yours - Saw XI!",2023-10-21
"Saw X set the stage for a lot of hype and speculation with fans, especially through my own eyes, however to keep it short and simple, this was a great time for Saw and horror fans alike.Nod-offs to the original, character development that'll catch you off guard and a captivating overall story that brings a breath of fresh air to the Saw legacy, this film keeps things simple and inline with most of the expected Saw tropes and happenings, yet rears a new head with this unique installment story that shows character development, leading to ( again ) nod-offs with the original and Saw II. This film is worth seeing, redeeming 100% for ill feelings fans may feel from the previous two installments, Jigsaw & Spiral.This captivating new installment doesn't fail, falls in line perfectly and doesn't skip a beat with it's loyalty return to roots. Recommended, fan or not!",2023-09-29
"Can't even describe how much I loved this movie. I've been a fan of Saw since I was very young, and this movie made me fall in love with the franchise even more! I do truly believe it is the best in the franchise yet!! Shawnee Smith and Tobin Bell were phenomenal once again, and the cinematography was undeniably stunning and everything was unbelievably magical. The traps were outstandingly original compared to the more recent installments, which I loved, in addition to there being plot twist after plot twist!! Nobody could have expected this coming!! Great job to everyone involved in the movie, and have fun watching!!!",2023-09-30
"Did John Kramer just become a hero?Great return after a few hit and miss attempts at reviving the Saw franchise. This felt more personal than the more recent attempts and definitely the first one to make sense since Saw 2..
Good traps and good reasons for them. The cinema sound adds to it, so watch it on the big screen if possible.There is more reasoning for the traps this time, and weirdly you end up rooting for Kramer.. Can't give too much away but it's very satisfying. I think people who left the franchise as it became convoluted would enjoy this one. And stay for some mid credit action too.",2023-10-11
"Genuinely thought that Parker Sears chap was played by Mark Duplass!Three people walked out of the cinema which is usually a good sign.Found it quite predictable with a number of plot holes but wasn't expecting a masterpiece. They should make a spin-off of how he managed to get those traps through customs in this day and age. Oh and a ""backstage"" film of setting them up and realising he's run out of cable ties and gaffer tape.Nothing will quite have the edge or twist of the first one for me which was incredible the first time I saw itAnyway, I enjoyed it. Looking forward to the next instalment!7/10.",2023-10-02

Good saw film I reckon and good story it's meant to be set between the first and second saw movies showing you the story that has never been seen is always a nice touch kind of like a prequal I just wished it was more bloodier and gruesome compared to the other saw films this is nowhere near as bad Amanda looked so different I know time goes on and you get older looks like she has had liposuction or something it's really hard to find out what to write as you need to write atheist 600 charactors so I just keep going til I reach the limit my favourite saw movies are this one and saw I hope a they make another one.,2023-09-29
"It was a good movie, i mean entertaining to be sure. Its just that a whole bunch of parts were very unbelievable. To me personally Saw 1 till 7 are all really, really good. And after that there's just these movies being released as Saw movies and they just don't hit that mark. Sure most of the stuff isn't believable, but when the traps themselves also just aren't very believable it falls flat on its face. I don't want to name specifically what parts jumped the shark but I have no doubt other viewers will notice them as well. As far as sequels go after part 7 this one was definitely better than the other 2 sequels after 7, its just kinda sad they had to nuke that fridge. Although arguably they already jumped the shark many sequels ago, I'd say that this one was the worst in that regard.",2023-10-21
"Here's my personal (& perhaps unpopular opinion) on Saw X film.Tobin Bell was obviously great to much of the audience praise, however, for me Cecilia was the Queen of Saw X. She is precisely the sort of villain we didn't think we need, but is exactly what is needed at this point of the Saw franchise. Her profile is perfect to go head-to-head with Jigsaw. An internationally renowned Dr, daughter of the pioneering Norwegian cancer researcher; she's cool, calm and collected, elegant and poised; beauty with brains one could say in contrast to her ""Scandi-noir"" cold, calculating, cunning, narcissistic and possibly psychopathic personality traits - these attributes are exactly what's required to ""win"" these games and go head-to-head with Jigsaw.Perhaps arguably, no one will really ever outwit, outsmart, outdo Jigsaw himself, but Cecilia went head-to-head with him and although did not succeed (not surprisingly), her attempt in doing so is worthy of much praise & applause as no one has even remotely come close to what she attempted in the entire Saw series - torturing Jigsaw himself and ""testing"" him in his own game, pitting him against an innocent boy. We must encourage such characterization and plot development more so in the future series to keep the franchise alive and unpredictable.We know for a fact that Cecilia got out alive (she ""won"" her test). She knows Jigsaw's true identity (and Amanda's) not to mention the severity and vulnerability of the state of his brain cancer. I want to see this Scandinavian psychopath go to great lengths to exploit this and ultimately outwit Jigsaw. Future series should also explore just how dark Cecilia actually is capable of - as cutting open someone's stomach only to use their intestines as a rope to retrieve a cellphone demonstrates, we want to see her twisted ways of achieving her self-vested goals. We need a formidable foe at this stage of the franchise to counter the unstoppable force of Jigsaw and his philosophy and methods ""in giving people a second chance at life"".PS 1: I found her kissing that con-man British guy that came to her rescue really cringey and too-hollywood. Not to mention we all knew that he's just another of her scapegoat.PS 2: I really like that Saw X was completely devoid of the police/detectives/SWOT team presence. They are extremely useless and clueless and only serves as filler materials IMO.",2023-10-24
"I'll be honest: I'm not a hardcore fan of SAW, but I can't deny that the first film won me over. It had a nightmarish, in-your-face quality that made it hard to turn away. What followed, however, gradually turned my curiosity to dust, although I won't say the entire series is a complete disaster. I think it just became stale. Now that I've seen SAW X, I'm happy to report that I truly enjoyed this entry, and even that it might be the most well-crafted film in the franchise. Whether or not it's the best, I leave for you to decide!One thing that makes SAW X work is the greater focus on story, one with a surprisingly creative and emotional pulse. For once, it felt like the filmmakers really wanted to make a real horror film with a real story. They abandoned most of the wild, overly frenetic visuals that became annoying after a while, and although there were a few of those moments here they weren't overused. The ""traps"" themselves were also delightfully over-the-top yet surprisingly well-staged and quite scary.The biggest asset this time was Tobin Bell, who does manage to give the film a little more emotion, and his grounded performance really made this worth the time. I do have mixed feelings about the final act, but the overall experience was a fun and genuinely gripping entry into the struggling franchise that, in the same hands, could open the doors for more sequels like this.",2023-09-30
"Let's face it, it's hard to keep a franchise going. Every franchise waxes and wanes, it has its ups and downs, as has Saw. This one was definitely a high point though. The fact that this outing is concentrated on John makes this entry something out of the ordinary for the franchise. Humanizing John makes gives the franchise fresh life. It allows us to understand, from a first hand perspective the motivations of the character. The writing in the movie was spectacular as well. It balanced the gore that we have come to love with real heart; so we can understand why John does what he does and why he is who he is. Bravo to the writers and I 100% recommend this for ANYONE who is even a moderate fan of the series.Can't wait for the next installment!",2023-10-20
"I can think of many titles for this movie but I will admit they aren't better despite being more accurate. Saw 1.5? Saw: Mexico? That's basically what it is and it would probably have gotten one of those titles if it had premiered on Netflix, for better or worse. Some things are strange about this movie like being the highest rated out of any Saw movie? It's not bad I just disagree that it deserves that level of praise. Again, the title doesn't make sense as this chronically lines up with being arguably a sequal to the first movie but a predecessor to the 2nd movie. This is my background with the Saw series: I watched the first 7 movies as they were released and there are definitely some I like more than others but I would say I enjoyed them all and I am a fan of the series, however I have not seen Jigsaw or Spiral and have intententionally been avoiding them based on what people are saying about them. So Saw X is basically trying to stitch itself in between the first and second movies and the transition isn't exactly the smoothest. Overall it tries to have an emotional story with some ""surprises"" that aren't exactly hard to see coming if you have seen some other Saw movies.",2023-10-26
"This Film Is Just Awesome! THE Twist was not as surprising as you might think it is. It's still huge and the story is overwhelmingThe acting Of Bell as Kramer is incredible.. I nearly teared up. Every actor did a good jobMy only downgrade is the actual look of this movie. Some times you see that this movie had 13M dollars budget. If they had spent 30M or 20M it would've been much better.I love this movie. The end credit scene is very cool and also the score of Charlie clouser is awesome. It reminds me of Saw 2,3, 7 score and also jigsaw. The scores never dissapointed and will. Zepp X is okay but awesome.",2023-09-29
"I saw this opening night in Dolby which was pretty epic overall. I honestly lost track of the series after the 4th or 5th, so I am probably missing context which may have made this one better within the scope of the entire series. But from my perspective, it was much less of a horror movie than I wanted, but more of just a well rounded movie, with flashes of nostalgic jigsaw moments which I couldn't get enough of.I think seeing the softer side of jigsaw potentially made sense in the context of the series, but as a stand alone movie it was not really what I had imagined. The mystique surrounding jigsaw is non existent, which makes the movie not scary at all in my opinion. They also spend the entire movie making you hate the female doctor woman and you watch all of the people she dragged into her scheme get tortured, yet she makes it to the very end and it is not even certain that she is trapped. She very well may have escaped. As a viewer this was highly frustrating I thought. I did enjoy the movie though overall and felt very nostalgic when the theme music played at the end when it was revealed that he had planned everything all along. 7.5/10.",2023-10-01
"This is the first Saw movie that introduced me to this franchise. And 'Saw X' is a masterpiece in my opinion. This film was everything I wanted and more.SAW X is a clever, solidly written, has the best characters, succeeds with the emotional aspect it was going for, those spins that make you say WTF, and ties up loose ends perfectly. Great cast ensemble lead by Tobin Bell. I can promise you one thing this movie is just like Saw 1 and has everything and loads more of gore than Saw 1 & 2. There is a mid credit scene that will leave the fans surprised.A must see, go and watch it and experience the shocks! 8/10.",2023-10-19
"Return to form for the saw franchise. I have seen this movie twice already and can say with confidence it is up there with my top 3 favorite saw movies. Its so well shot, with the look and feel of a traditional saw movie, the traps are, in my opinion, some of the most brutal we have seen in the franchise. This is one of the only saw movies that when the traps are happening you actually get uneasy and uncomfortable watching them and I say that in a very good way. The way Tobin Bell plays Jigsaw and Shawnie Smith playing Amanda was incredible. The movie builds their bond so well and we get to see John Cramer actually vulnerable for the first time in a while. The plot feels solid and well paced with no boring parts, the scammers are also rightfully tested. Later Saw films put people who didn't deserve to be in traps in un-winnable situations and it did not feel fun, this movie does the opposite with their traps feeling disturbing but satisfying. All in all this is one of the best Saw films ever, a pure return to form that will please hardcore fans and new fans alike. P. S stick around for the mid credit scene. You will not be disappointed.",2023-09-30
"A Saw sequel (set between Saw and Saw II) I didn't think I needed!The story which is a little more personal and directly related to John Kramer took its time to build before getting to the expected carnage.The ""grungy/early 2000's music video"" editing style that's a signature element of this series is a little toned down here which is nice - but that's of course subjective, and a matter of preference.Saw and Saw X make an excellent double bill. The other entries are entertaining but never reach the level of care that these two receive.A solid entry into the twisted world of Jigsaw. Recommend!",2023-10-25
"Absolutely astounding, the best saw film in years. Centering around John Kramer and giving us twists and turns never before seen in the franchise. This film is easily one of the best films of year and should be see by every saw, bringing back the color palette and choppy editing style use in the original films paired with graphics of todays films really made for and amazing film. The emotion and depth put into these characters, to see just a little more behind the mask was an amazing touch. Adding to the fact that we got a cameo with @jiggysawgirl and mark Hoffman, this truly is a masterpiece in the saw franchise.",2023-09-30
"I was happy to see a legit ""Saw"" aka ""Jig Saw"" movie return to the big screen. This was like Saw 1.5 because it's timeline takes place between Saw 1 & 2. The last Saw movie I seen was ""Spiral"" by Chris Rock (yeah the black comedian) which goes to show that NOT every black comedian such as Jordan Peele can pull off good writing & great horror movies. I was to say the least VERY disappointed in ""Spiral"" which led me to question if I even wanted to take a chance on Saw X. I'm glad I did take a chance because I really enjoyed Saw X and I'm hoping to see lots of more of John Kramer & the Saw franchise!",2023-10-07
"I've neven seen any of movies since i do not like horrors. I went with my child age 17 since she can not go alone under 18. I tried to watch some movie on my phone, but the sound was too loud for my headphones so i gave up and watched the movie. When we walked home i realized that i watched something that has 9 movies before that that i don't know nothing about. But i had questions, about Amanda and traps, i knew something is off. Lol.But i liked the movie in a way that i have spent an 40 min walk home and conversation with my child about morality and how it is subjective and subject to comparison of what we believe or not to be better or worse, justified or less justified, and on the basis of which my daughter and I draw conclusions Only thing that was constantly on my mind was that people can not go through this without loss of consciousness.So i have found some grounds to share my opinions. In first 40 min i aksed my child 10 times ""where is the horror"" and i was also little bored (maybe way more without context lol). So i took from this movie what i do like to analize and found it very good. I give it a 6 even tho i think i am not compatibile to rate this.",2023-10-22
"If the perfect Saw movie I can imagine gets a 10/10 than Saw X gets a 7/10 from me.Warning SPOILERS!I liked that they had Jigsaw as main protagonist and Amanda was right there too. They had a little scene with Detective Hoffman too. That was nice and that was good.The leadup/buildup of the story was kinda long but it was good too. It made you really feel as betrayed as Jigsaw must have felt.The trap designs were all somewhat logical as in that they couldnt just escape them without playing but some sadly were unrealistic like the radiation device. Overall the traps felt pretty simple or when they were more complicated the focus sadly wasnt on the traps.The biggest problems I had with this movie is that the subjects who pretty much completed the tests and endured all the pain that was supposed to make them cherish life still died one way or another. If they took for example all the pain but have to wait 30 seconds for a key to disolve thats kinda dumb if thats the reason to fail the trap...
The death of Gabrielle was the worst to witness. I know that Amanda changed the order and stuff but I dont like the writing if I have to get angry at Jigsaw.The end was a typical I am not trapped in here with you, you are trapped in here with me plottwist that however was pretty obvious considering that Jigsaw somehow had to survive.Then the archenemy of the movie had a very easy fight for her life and survived. Afaik she even must have made it out. That was very unsatisfying.The acting was great, especially the actor of Jigsaw was fantastic. The leadup was great but then it didnt really deliver like the early Saws did.",2023-10-30
Honestly the new horror movies that have been released from last year and this year so far saw x has been the best one yet I really like how it was gory thrilling and all of the torture gadgets were incredible plus the setting in the movie was a nice touch not to mention the story behind it was easy to consume and you didn't even have to watch the other saw movies just to understand this one overall I totally enjoyed watching this movie and if your looking to go to the movies and haven't decided what to watch come and see saw x but you shouldn't bring young kids if they get scared easily thanks.,2023-10-09
"Tobin Bell plays a somewhat emotional John Kramer who's looking for an (impossible) cure for his cancer. When a shady organization reaches out, he uses the last hope he has left for a possible treatment. In the first part of the movie, we go on an emotional ride along with Kramer, something we rarely experienced before. It sets a perfect story for the movie.Also, though a common mistake in many horror-movies, the movie doesn't rush to kill off some random people just for the sake of blood and gore on your screen; it takes its time to build a story worth watching. And it pays off! When the killing starts, (and oh dear ... it's gut-wrenching,) it's worth the wait.A good story, the characters feel right, and a typical Saw-ending with big twists; what more can you wish from a Saw-movie?Take out the popcorn and enjoy!",2023-10-20
"The Saw franchise is 20 years old now, they have typically been fun movies with lots of twists turns and traps. Convoluted plots and reliance on gore have been major tropes in the franchise that have put it down.The heart and soul of every Saw movie and when every Saw movie is at its best, is when it focuses on the notorious morally grey antagonist and in some peoples eyes protagonist of the series Jigsaw himself John Kramer. This movie does what some how no other Saw movie has done prior. It completely focuses on the character of John Kramer and puts the audience in his shoes. Seeing everything from his perspective makes you understand him more than ever and even having you cheer for him, in arguably the best movie of the franchise . Jigsaw has always been a sympathetic character but he was always more of a side character in the majority of the movies. Seeing everything from his perspective, breathes so much fresh air into this long running franchise. Despite his cruel nature and horrific sense of justice, He always kept his moral integrity and lived by a code of ethics. We see this done ten fold in this film.He is without question the protagonist of this movie. After being deceived by people promising him a cure for his cancer, we see just how horribly deceptive and ambiguous human beings can be. The traps as always, metaphorically reflect the victims dirty deeds that caused them to be trapped in the first place. This time with more suspense and build up then most of the prior Saw movies. They are as gruesome as they are poetic.What this movie as the title reflects does so well and prominently is honor the legacy of Saw and its characters. John Kramer is better than ever with his story out in full display and his born again apprentice Amanda is handled very well in this outing really showing off the emotional dynamic between her and John. Also watch out for the post credits scene for it is great fan service for Saw fans!I have minor criticisms regarding the timeline and characters physical appearances, but that's about it!Saw X surprised me with deep compelling storytelling, character study, and gory good suspense. If this truly is game over for the franchise(doubt it), then it was really well played.",2023-10-01
"The Saw franchise is one of the longest running sagas in film history. We can think of few films whose history spans such a long period of time. But there are still exceptions (Fast and Furious, Phantasm, Halloween) in 2004, when the first movie was released, after that the rest of the parts did not seem to match the audience's expectations. However, the 10th film did not leave the audience disappointed. The film has grossed 80 million and it has only been in theaters for a month. So that financial success will increase over time. In my opinion, John Kramer is the only antagonist you can root for. This man's moral code involves punishing sinful people. Kramer kidnaps criminals, criminals, crooks and the like and engages them in sadistic games.Producers assigned Kevin Grotert to direct the 10th episode. The experienced filmmaker, who took part in the shooting of many Saw series, did not refuse the new offer. Why is this episode one of the highlights of this film saga? Because the franchise concept has not changed. Kramer is still at it. I'm not a fan of this serial killer, but the 10th movie seems to encourage the audience to not be indifferent to the saw. I would pick John's transformation. Which I would divide into three segments. 1) The beginning of the movie (a desperate Kramer performs surgery and looks like an innocent person) 2) The middle of the movie (an enraged John starts torturing the employees of a fraudulent oncology clinic) 3) The end (This is where I first saw a pity-obsessed killer who is confused) The climax of the movie was really amazing, In an unexpected turn of events, but the last scene felt a certain injustice, because the main organizer of this fraudulent scheme, Dr. Cecilia Pederson, survived, and because of this fact, I think they will make an 11th film.",2023-10-30
"So as the digital release date got nearer, I ran a SAW marathon & watched the entire 9 films before watching X.Believe me when I say this, Tobin Bell really deserves an award for his performances in Saw, especially for X!This isn't your typical SAW movie so when you get ready to watch it..keep in mind that you're in for an emotional thriller.I really liked the direction and the acting of every vast member as this portrayed a surely high budget film.Surely X comes in the top 3, following SAW 1 & SAW 2 (those really were the classics).It was really a fan boy moment for me & I enjoyed every scene of this movie.10/10 for everything.",2023-10-25
"So I only got into the franchise about 3 or 4 years ago having not been a horror fan up until recently. Saw quickly became my favorite series even if it got a bit ridiculous in the later movies. It was really interesting to see how this movie portrayed John Kramer. We never really saw the previous movies from his POV for the majority but there was time and care put into showing us what its like as he is controlling the games as well have a bit more sympathy towards him, something that got harder and harder to do as the movies went on. Tobin Bell put on an amazing perfomance and is still one of the greatest horror icons of all time. Shawnee Smith returns as Amanda Young and she didn't miss a beat, getting a glimpse of her lust for blood but also seeing her relationship with Kramer and her attachment to the games was amazing to see play out. Some of the players of the games were a bit cheesy but Saw has had plenty of cheesy characters so it fits in perfectly.",2023-10-10
I am fairly impressed with how in the TENTH installment in this franchise they can still manage to not feel completely on replay. Quite the contrary we get to see more of the man behind the traps and that made it feel more like a third movie in a series.The usual stuff is the usual stuff. Offend Kramer. Pain. Repeat. The traps are standard except the last one where it builds up to a long finale that feels a bit contrived albeit ok. Decent emotional landings.If you like Saw this is good. Definitely in the top 3 of the franchise I have followed for decades now. While this is a win I'd still advise the team to consider retiring the franchise around here to go out on a high note. The risk is that with none of the actors getting any younger the flashbacks and the plot twist will eventually just come up snake eye sockets.,2023-10-27
"I really love this instalment because it shows the vulnerability of John Kramer as a serial killer by playing his most personal game with medical scammers.If you love blood and guts, this movie does not disappoint as the traps are very brutal and medical in nature, symbolic of what the medical scammers deserve after what they did to John.The movie starts out a bit slow but picks up rather quickly into the main plot and the plot twist is rather satisfying, albeit leaving the fate of one victim unknown.Another thing I love are all the references from Saw I/II and even Jigsaw, such as when John tells Valentina that the tourniquet and Gigli saw are the keys to her freedom, he says the same thing to Anna and Ryan in the shotgun collar test in Jigsaw. Also, when Cecilia, Mateo and Gabriela are trying to reach the cellphone in the middle, it reminded me of Dr. Gordon reaching for the cellphone in the bathroom test in Saw. And finally, when Cecilia and Parker were trapped inside the control room at the end and when the room started filling with a toxic gas, it reminded me of the nerve gas house in Saw II (which John will get inspiration to set up with Hoffman). There is also a small reference to Saw III when John is in the park and he is sketching The Rack trap which will be used for Timothy Young.However, I would have liked it if they showed not just Amanda and Hoffman, but also Logan Nelson and Dr. Gordon, another 2 of John Kramer's apprentices who were in the medical line to assist John with the medical aspects of the traps here, since they were around chronologically.It wouldn't make sense for John to set up the traps with just Amanda and Hoffman as they have no medical background. However I guess the directors left them out due to screen time and to focus more on Amanda's character.Overall, Saw X has definitely put the Saw series back on track and I will definitely watch it a second time.",2023-10-22
"The saw movies aren't know for being great works of art, and most of them could probably be described as exactly the opposite. The only movies that are generally considered ""passable"" in their own right would be the first two. Yet, somehow, by some miracle, this tenth instalment may be the best one so far. The acting was surprisingly good. The story was interesting, and whilst calling it ""deep"" might be a stretch, it undoubtably had more depth to it than most main-stream movies do these days. The twists were clever despite the many plot holes. That being said, it is still very much a Saw film and thus contains the same typical flaws and cliches of this franchise. On a final note, I appreciated the fact they didn't de-age the characters, but never have I ever had to suspend my disbelief so much before in regard to a character's age: There is no way in hell John Kramer is a man in his 50s!",2023-10-23
"The ending of the film wasn't that great, but the post credit scene had me jumping in my seat. The traps were brutal and the action was intense. Even though Spiral put a new spin on the franchise I really didn't think it felt enough like a Saw film, but this movie brings back so much nostalgia from the early 2000's
John Kramer was so intimidating in this Movie. His mere presence was immediately known. Zepp X is also such a banger in this movie. It sounds like a mix of the well obviously Hello Zepp theme, but mixed with, MK techno syndrome and Mad Max: Brothers in Arms.If you love the original 3 Saw movies you will absolutely adore this film.",2023-10-01
"Other than the over-the-top satiricalesque yellow filter that appears out of thin air the second the characters are in Mexico, this was surprisingly a very good movie, one of the best to have come out this year.All throughout the first act you can feel Kramer full of hope, wishing that this new alternate medicine will be the treatment he needed to get rid of his cancer. Everyone there is a con-artist, there are little clues later exposed in the movie.The gore scenes were brutal, typical Saw torture devices (cut your leg off or you die to a guillotine type of mechanism, break your limbs or you'll burn to death, etc).The plot twist at the end (trap) was again foreshadowed by the short dialogue Amanda and Kramer had with Sears.Overall, this movie is what Saw needed and I'm excited where the franchise goes next.",2023-09-30
"""I want to play a game...""Saw X was marketed quite well, especially for a horror film these days! So, my expectations were high.Being a massive fan of the franchise (yes, all of the original films; not Spiral) I had high hopes for Tobin Bell's triumphant return to the big screen. And it did not disappoint.Bell delivers the best version of John Kramer yet. A complex and flawed anti-hero. You get a clear view of the world as John sees it, and it isn't hard to understand why he does what he does.The traps are great. The designs are more ""home-made"" than the previous films, which I really enjoy. It gives it much more grit.The characters (aside from Kramer and Amanda) are fine, but they're the weakest point of the film. You're basically waiting to see them die. But make no mistake, it is truly horrific to watch the carnage unfold.Tobin Bell breathes new life into the franchise that has been kicking for nearly twenty years - which not an easy feat. And please stay for the mid-credits scene!",2023-09-30
"Extremely innovative traps, brilliant twists, incredible music score, mind blowing ending.The movie was everything a diehard Saw fan could have ever wished for. So much fan service and so many moments we never knew we could have gotten.The traps were so innovative and gruesome, but just as good as any other Saw trap! I almost had to look away at some of the more intense moments, but that would be a waste of a good movie ticket ;) The ending and mid-credit scene were surprising in all the good ways. Never saw them coming! Stay seated folks!The soundtrack was blasting its way though the movie and it only added to the atmosphere of EVERYTHING. Highly recommend listening to it after the movie!",2023-09-30
"At first just as a seriously sick man suffering from terminal cancer & desperately accepting an alternative therapy in Mexico where everything is supposedly going well... Until he finds out that it was all a big hoax & the tumor in his head was never removed.So he sets out for revenge, in the good old Jigsaw style! Hell yeah! It's bloody and sadistic with his traps, of course including a little chance that they all let slip by again and again.(Most of) The characters get what they deserve and that's just wonderful.John Cramer is definitely the hero here, he has the sympathy of the audience, the fake doctor is the number 1 object of hate here!Amanda is also back & helps him diligently. I never liked her but she still does a great job!However. The ending was more than disappointing. I want to keep this review spoiler-free, so watch the film yourself!",2023-11-02
"This film, in no uncertain terms, is an egregious waste of both time and money. From start to finish, it fails to deliver on even the most modest of expectations. The plot is a jumbled mess, lacking coherence and leaving viewers with more questions than answers. The characters are one-dimensional and unrelatable, making it impossible to invest emotionally in their fates.Cinematographically, it's a lackluster effort with uninspiring visuals and a disregard for artistic innovation. The script is riddled with clichés and poor dialogue, leaving actors with little to work with. This results in wooden performances that further detract from any potential enjoyment.The direction of this film is baffling, as it seems to lack a clear vision or purpose. It's as though the filmmakers had no idea what they were trying to achieve. The pacing is all over the place, with moments of mind-numbing tedium followed by chaotic, unintelligible action sequences.In short, if you're considering spending your hard-earned money and valuable time on this film, I implore you to reconsider. It's a prime example of what not to do in filmmaking. It's devoid of entertainment value, creativity, and any semblance of a coherent narrative. Save yourself the disappointment and steer clear of this cinematic disaster.",2023-10-31
"Saw X marks a notable return to the franchise's roots, following a string of less impressive sequels. Set in the narrative space between the original installment and its sequel, the film delves deeply into character development for John Kramer, known as Jigsaw, in a manner unparalleled by any prior entry. With a dramatic opening that spans the initial 15-20 minutes, the movie ultimately retains its hallmark Saw essence, punctuated by visceral violence. While the intricacy of the traps may not reach the extremity witnessed in earlier entries, they still being the teeth grinding discomfort. Additionally, a post-credit scene is poised to offer an unexpected twist for dedicated followers of the franchise.",2023-10-15
"The original Saw is hands down one of the best movies in the genre - such an original but simple concept brilliantly executed. Then we had the sequels, and the sequels to the sequels, and sure there were some gems within those individual movies - a few very creative traps or nice twists that added more backstory and lore. But never was there a entire movie in the franchise since the original that was as impactful, and with each new release fans started to lose hope. With that piece of total BS that was 'Spiral' I gave up hope for good - I didn't even know they were making 'Saw X'. I happened to catch a trailer a few months ago and was intrigued but not hopeful. I've just watched it and holy S...does it deliver. So good I instantly watched it again - it has that feel of the original, but with John and Amanda leading the narrative and the underlying motivation of revenge. Fans of the franchise will absolutely NOT be disappointed. Great stuff.",2023-10-30
"After the last couple of movies in the franchise, I went into Saw X without much expectation and came out pleasantly surprised. The film was immensely gory as expected, but the foulness didn't feel overdone. Each trap was super unique and refreshing, nothing felt rehashed.The motives of John Kramer were written remarkably well as he isn't a serial killer-just an avenger. Even if his methods are questionable and fairly undesirable, he carries his belief of righting wrongs throughout the whole film and absolutely delivers with each waking moment.The lesson I learned from this movie remains as one should: never mess with John Kramer; it won't end well for them.",2023-09-29
"Well it's the tenth movie in the series, so if you're squeamish or put off by gore and horrendous ways to meet your end then you probably won't be reading this.Saw movies lost their way in recent years and veered off the winning formula that made it such a successful franchise to begin with. Well I'm finally delighted to say that Jigsaw is back and Saw X marks a return to form.Whilst not completely flawless, Saw X delivers the most compelling story to date which makes the movie feel more.. well human. It gave more meaning to the participants John Kramer (played by Tobin Bell) selected to put through his disturbing array of death inducing puzzles. Not simply plucking criminals from off the street.John Kramer acts wonderfully here. The film, set between the events of Saw 1 and Saw 2 deals with the issue of John's cancer diagnosis and his struggle to accept that he had months to live. A friend who he meets in a support group later bumps into John and tells him that he is miraculously cured of cancer and refers John to the clinic that cured him.This is the most vulnerable we have seen the infamous puzzle master. Blindly following his hope of a cure to Mexico where he would under-go medical treatment. What follows would completely spoil the story but it educates us more on how John Kramer became who he is.I have a couple of niggles though. Jigsaw the eerie tricycle-riding puppet only makes one brief appearance. And the entire murderous trial part of the movie is a little bit short for my liking. With that being said, the sadistic contraptions and panic driven choices make a return here in true Saw fashion.",2023-10-30
"It surpassed my expectations. Kept me gripped to my seat the whole time. Have to say I haven't been as happy with an horror movie for a long time as I was with this one.Brilliant acting, amazing storytelling, you actually feel something for the characters. Movie starts slow as it builds up the characters and then second half starts the fun.This one really makes you question John's reasoning for what he does and if he is actually in the wrong here as this movie has such a great antagonist.Worst part of this movie is that it finished. I think I would be happy with one more hour of this. Happily Saw 11 now, fingers crossed!",2023-09-29
"These days you dont see much good movies in terms of horror, slayer or psychological thrillers on box office. Some classics like scream and Michael Myers belongs to two decades ago and are not thrilling anymore, some others like those about supernatural entities are also not creative ideas, but jigsaw still surprises you, no spoiling, It has amazing plot and traps as always. Wonderfully everything fits to the main storyline as a good prequel, good actors, now i believe choosing Tobin bell for the first time was very smart decision. Hope it continues, with more movies. I am afraid talking more about anything spoils the nice movie.",2023-10-20
"Listen guys!!!!!! I made the mistake of reading good reviews and getting myself hyped up!!!!! Yes the film is brilliant... but couldn't help feeling let down because of the amazing reviews. Don't have any expectations!!!!!!! It's a good movie, very different!!!!!! Takes it back to when saw was about story over traps (and I love the traps) I can't say anymore without giving spoilers. It's 7/10 but maybe that's because I felt slightly let down from the buzz. Movie is very good, one trap literally made me scream.. the whole movie theatre was looking at me 😂Go see it ! I hope they do more from here... good to see a decent saw movie at the theatre again.",2023-09-30
"This film is very interesting and amazing. Saw X provides a good narrative, with strong Jigsaw characterization and a very interesting twist. The script by Josh Stolberg and Peter Goldfinger moves quite slowly towards the heart of the story which is full of surprises.Tobin Bell, the actor who plays Jigsaw, delivers a great performance in this film. He not only plays a master trap maker, but also as John Kramer, a retired civil engineer who is diagnosed with cancer and will soon die. In this film, Jigsaw is not an antagonist but a protagonist or more precisely an antihero.Saw However, this trip did not go as smoothly as expected. Doctors who offer false hope turn out to be frauds. Kramer feels betrayed, leading him to not only fight for his life, but also to get his revenge on these cheaters.Through Saw X, the audience is invited to see the other side of Jigsaw's motivation. This film opens up a new perspective on this character and gives it a new dimension of depth. Viewers are invited to see that traps are not just tools of torture, but rather educational media for people who are considered perpetrators of crimes and do not value other people's lives. The trap show in Saw X is one of the most impressive and creative elements.",2023-10-19
"Very rarely does a movie shock of surprise me. This movie is the definition of a twist. Probably the best saw since the first one. Totally blew my mind. Absolutely incredible. Normally the twists are at the end of movies. This movie contains twists and shocks thru out that you WILL NOT expect. And also explores a side of jigsaw himself that we previously haven't seen. I loved seeing amanda back as his side kick. Not only does it explore a part of john's personality we've never seen but we also get great insight into his life and even how he comes up with ideas for a new ""game"" can't rave about this enough. I'm a die hard saw stan and i can't decide which is best. This one or the first.",2023-10-22
"*SPOILERS* About the Plot Through The Main Story, and Characters Throughout SAW X. Including *SPOILERS* About the Best Post Credit Scene in this Latest 10th Installment throughout all of The SAW Franchise from SAW(2004)-(Written and Directed by The Legendary James Wan(The Atomic Monster Production Studio Creator))- SAW X. Including JIGSAW(2017) and The Spin-off SAW Film: SPIRAL: The Book of SAW(2021)
This Review.It does everything and more and for the First Time in Out of All 9 SAW Films it was based on The Jigsaw Killer John Kramer instead of a side character that will turn out to be either working with Jigsaw or be made into another one of Jigsaw's apprentice. Just reiterating my thoughts. I walked away, really, liking this movie. My enthusiasm for the software and Charles was at an all time low with the past 3 movies. And this one just saved it. And It turned out being a really fun SAW movie. But it was also just a great story. Having a focus on John Kramer and his personal vendetta to get back at these scammers for stealing money and tricking all these people that they can cure their cancer was such a satisfying revenge plot to go through. The traps in here are also very bloody and grotesque. I mean, I've watched the whole SAW Franchise over and over. This is the first time in a while where I was actually going Oh My God No. Overall, this movie just finally reminded me. Why I fell in love with this franchise so long ago. Frankly, so diving into specifics on the movie starting off from the very beginning, it starts off kinda slow. The creative team really wanted us to spend time with John Kramer and not necessarily Jigsaw and that was kind of refreshing, although through flashbacks of other saw sequels, we got to see a lot of john's personal life, this felt really common, really chilling. You are feeling that John Kramer is dying? And although I have seen some people criticise the beginning for being a little slow like I just feel like it was so necessary to just breathe into this world with him. Because although John Kramer is the villain of the series and is the twisted psychopath, putting people in these traps, the way they made us care about him and go. What a sweet old man, I hope he cures his cancer. And like I knew the plot of the movie. I knew what was supposed to happen and they where fooling me.",2023-10-01
"I'm a huge fan of the franchise. I loved this film, despite the first half hour being quite boring, but necessary to give background to the victims and, of course, to feel more hatred for them. However, I found the plot twist very weak compared to the other movies.The humanization they gave to John was perfect, something we never saw so much in other films. He's on screen all the time. The return of old characters was a great thing to see.I'm excited for the next films and also curious to know what they'll do from now on.I don't think it's better than saw 1, 2 and 3, but definitely better than everything that came after them. So watch and draw your own conclusions.",2023-09-28
"It was very nice to see Toby after a long time, 2 hours of Toby were stunning, the Story is interesting, it looks like a breeze. If we compare it with current films in the primitive genre, then this is more interesting and at least more logical, or something, unlike the slag that is being shoved at us today. The scenes of violence are executed 10/10 there is also a pleasant ending, which is typical for the genre) Good and evil. Truth and lie. Whole and Part. Light and darkness. The road of life for every person lies somewhere in the middle of these concepts... Who can condemn those who stumble? Who can teach a lesson about fate to people who do not value their lives? Who would risk replacing themselves with retribution? Rock? Are there people who are not guilty of anyone, not even themselves? Who decides who should live and who should leave the scene of life? John Cramer !!!",2023-09-28
"10 movies in a 19-year series, all masterpieces. But this movie was Jigsaw's most personal game. As in every movie, the action was at its peak and Jigsaw again showed his intelligence from a place I never expected. The movie starts nice and calm and ends in a way reminiscent of saw 1. John kramer's trashing of his toy plans after he thought he was cured of cancer showed again and again that he was truly innocent.as usual, every word that jigsaw says is not understood at that time, but as soon as the players start the game, it comes again and then it is understood.this movie, which I have re-watched every movie from time to time and have been waiting for since 2017, was for me a masterpiece on par with saw 1.",2023-10-30
"This film is an amazing addition to the franchis e, and it's particularly noteworthy for individuals who have been hesitant to dive into the Saw series due to its reputation for excessive gore. The movie successfully strikes a balance, offering a fresh take that's less gruesome while retaining the suspense and psychological intrigue that the franchise is known for.One of the standout aspects of this installment is the lead actor's phenomenal performance. They skillfully navigate the complex character dynamics and bring a depth to the story that's truly commendable. Their portrayal sets the stage for the franchise to continue exploring this new thematic direction, which is a welcome change for those who may have been put off by the excessive violence in previous Saw films.In my opinion, this film merits a higher rating than it has received. It not only breathes new life into the Saw franchise but also shows that it can adapt and remain captivating while appealing to a broader audience. This kind of evolution is precisely what the series needed to stay relevant and continue to engage fans and newcomers alike.",2023-10-12
"Hey, a new Saw movie! I didn't really believe it when I first heard it, but now that I've seen it... It was surprisingly good! I like the storyline, and that it's like played out in the past when John was diagnosed with cancer.The plot twist later hit me like a brick, when John found out that he hadn't actually been cured from the cancer and that the 'secret hospital' thingy had tricked him. I can say, I was shocked.Anyway, the traps are amazing as usual! I love the amazing designs of these traps, they really inspire me! I think it good that John got revenge >:)9/10, all the saw movies are good!",2023-10-30
"I was on a date. I didn't realize I would be playing a game while on this date.. I don't know about yall but John Kramer didn't like what he Saw. But I did. I wouldn't have blinked. But it was a 2 hour movie. I thought the movie was going to be a scam (a cash grab) but no. John was the one who was scammed in this movie. Not me. Don't scam your own life. But frfr, this is my favorite of the entire franchise. This may have some spoilers but if you know you know type of thing.. but if you really knew.. do you really value another's life? How about your own? This movie will show weather if you really value John Kramers life or not. In this movie, I fully feel John's feelings. But can you feel as I feel? Can you see as I see? You might get taken on a shotgun carousel by watching this. This movie might put you on edge like you're in a scalping seat. This movie is the in a needle pit of all of the movies. This. Is. Twisted Pictures. BEST production. Lionsgate is known for making good movies. But this. This was the movie that makes me think they messed up by killing John off so early. I wouldn't be surprised if they scrapped saw 3+ to remake and keep him alive for a good few movies. I'd be okay with it. But I love all of them. But this is the movie to see.",2023-10-03
"""Saw X"" is an unexpected and quite good return of the franchise. Proving to be one of the best installments, it takes us back to the roots of the series. Here's what you can say about the movie:A quality story that knows exactly what it wants to tell the audience. Impressive challenges and interesting traps. The trademark violence is still there. Tobin Bell's acting.Nothing fundamentally new about ""Saw X"" when you watch it. Some may not like the attempt to ""whiten"" the character of John Kramer.The movie unfolds between the first and second part of the series, ignoring the complex plot intricacies that have accumulated over the years of the franchise. This allows ""Saw X"" to be the most focused movie possible, with a clear story and its own moral lessons. The traps in the movie aren't overly extravagant, but each one has its own interesting meaning. The trademark brutality is also present on an appropriate level.All in all, Saw X is a good movie that will please fans of the horror genre and has all the elements we love about the series.",2023-10-27
"The best movie of the saw franchise after of course saw 1 ,the traps were great and the movie was not very long and you dont have to watch any of the movies in saw franchise before watching it.Before watching the movie i thought it will be just a cash grab in the name of saw franchise but i was wrong the movie was great and worth the time and in my opinion the was a great horror movie but it is not for fait hearted people obviously because of the intense gore i think this movie have taken the whole franchise at a new level .But the worst part is that Gabriella dies in the end so i am giving 4 stars otherwise it deserves 6 stars ..",2023-10-29
"I loved this movie!!! That being said, if you're expecting a well written super scary cinematic masterpiece, look elsewhere. This is a saw movie through and through, if you've learned to love the convoluted storyline, unnecessary plot twists, obscure dialogue such as "" I guess you could say this is EPIC BAD LUCK"" you will love this film like I did. The traps were really well done, except for the fact that they were all a little unfair. Nevertheless it was a fun watch. My biggest complaint is the end of the movie, it feels honestly like they wanted a twisty turny gasp-inducing final scene, but that was a swing and a miss. Also what the heck are they doing with that little boy???!",2023-10-01
"I was inspired to create an IMDb account just so I could review this film. Although spoilers are allowed, I'll do my best to keep my review spoiler-free because I don't want to rob any one of experiencing this film in all its glory. I've been enthralled with the Saw franchise ever since the first one in 2004. I love that very little of the sick, twisted, gory violence throughout the franchise is gratuitous; almost all of it is done for a specific purpose. I also love how certain scenes throughout the films that seem like a throwaway moment at first glance, prove to be significant later on. Saw X is the most masterfully crafted installment in the franchise, competing with the original 2004 film for the top spot. It's a truly unsettling, chilling, nail-biting, edge-of-your seat experience. As a character said in a previous installment ""you wanna know the only thing wrong with killing you? I can only do it once."" Similarly, I wish I could experience watching Saw X for the first time again, but even on a second viewing, I noticed things that I missed the first time that added to my enjoyment of this masterpiece. I don't hand out 10-star ratings haphazardly, but this film earned it.",2023-10-22
"Its really different from other movies coming from saw franchise wich was little refreshing but also a little anoying becouse in all other Saw movies police is one of the main plot lines and in Saw X police doesnt evwn apear wich kind of makes sanse becouse movie happens somewhere between Saw 1 and Saw 2 . On the other side traps are interesting but kinda stupid and there is a lot of gore even for a Saw franchise wich was little shocking becouse last 2 movies were a lot less bloody. Movie focuses mostly on john kramer and it does it pretty well maybe story is a bit predictable and the main ""villain"" was lazy writen and annoying but you wont get bored though people who watched previous saw movies may be a little disappointed with the ending. I would recomend this movie even to people who didnt watched any previous thing from this franchise there is absolutely no mention of previous and past events and characters apart from john and amanda.",2023-09-30
"I am a huge fan of the saw franchise ! It's awesome how they can keep it fresh with 10 movies and still keep us hanging...the only thing you can take from this being a spoiler is trust me there will be more (really hoping so).I loved this movie it was soo bum clenching and had me hiding behind my hands from the beginning. I loved how we seen more of John Kramer, Tobin bell is an amazing actor he made this movie and the traps are even better than you can imagine.Loved it can't fault it...well apart from John looking older than he did in previous movies the cap doesn't appear in this though 😂",2023-09-30
"I went into this movie not thinking much of it, I enjoy most of the Saw movies (the only one I haven't seen is Spiral) but other than the first three, I don't really consider any of them all that good. Things changed with Saw X.This movie takes a much more personal touch on John Kramer's story, and it delves much deeper on the questioning of whether his reasoning for what he does is justified, which was present since the first movie but not to the extent of this one.The games are well thought out and the death scenes are about what you expect from a Saw movie. It delivers everything you could want from Saw and much more. Some of the twists are a little predictable, but they're very satisfying and well done nonetheless.In the end, this movie is quite possibly my favorite in the entire franchise, I recommend it to both Saw fans and non-fans alike (as long as you don't mind gore, of course).",2023-10-01
"I have seen all the movies a couple of times. Amazing script, makes us smypathize with Kramer, showing us the human part of him. Before this movie, Kramer had accepted his fate and his death and we as the audience thought Kramer has no desire whatsoever to live. This movie changes that and its wonderful. Acting is significantly awesome. Of course, the plot twist was predictable but once you saw a Saw movie you know something fishy is coming and you cannot quite tell what it is-Genius.Until this day you made great movies: Make new Saw movies just like this, the choice is yours.Note: Amanda never ages.",2023-10-21
"It's been over a decade since Saw: The Final Chapter (aka Saw 3D/Saw 7) was released. The film finally wrapped up the storyline between Doctor Gordon and the villainous Detective Hoffman. As with the rest of the original films, alongside the story ran an awesome trap about a man pretending to suffer a jigsaw trap, and profiteering via books and publicity.After that, the story was left finished for the most part with a few open ending questions. Was Doctor Gordon taking over? Who were the other masked vigilantes working with him? How far did the legacy of John Kramer (Jigsaw) go?Unfortunately, the studio heads at Lionsgate and Twisted Pictures opted to go in a different direction. Rather than go further ahead, they decided to go backwards with the awful ""Jigsaw"" stand alone film that left more plot holes and a bad taste in the mouth. More than anything else; it's different take on the franchise was hollow and confusing. After this, a few more years pass and we are given ""Spiral: From the Book of Saw"". This was a film that we all could of gone without. Not only did it 'Spiral' downhill further than ""Jigsaw"", it was riddled with horrible characters, a story that had no connection to the other films and just felt disingenuous to the core of the franchise. As it stood as somewhat a sequel, it was a great example of all the WRONG ways to go with a Saw film. After this abomination it seemed like we were left with a dead franchise... until Saw X was announced and boy did it deliver.The format wasn't completely back the way it used to be, however it's hard to complain about much with this film. The timeline taking place between the first two Saw films, it made an excellent addition to the canonical series. Not only do we get a new story with John Kramer (Jigsaw) once again reprised by the great man himself, Tobin Bell. We also get to see Amanda Young (Shawnee Smith), Jigsaw's other half in her learning curb days. The story broadens on Kramer's life battling cancer with a breakthrough treatment that could cure him once and for all. He seems to change to a degree where it seems like things would of been different... had this not all been a scam.Since bad people have to learn not to take life for granted, Jigsaw returns to teach the scammers some hard lessons with some innovative and new painfully exquisite traps.I won't go further as this is supposed to be a spoiler free review and if you've read this far, trust me you will love this movie and welcome it as part of the saga. It's not completely back to where it was, but it's a HUGE difference between the previous two abominations and actually stands very well. There's a large chance we will see more (hopefully!) of the franchise as this has done very well, rightfully so. 8/10 for a great comeback; hoping for more.",2023-11-01
"I was reading through the reviews and I was so disappointed at the bad ones. This movie was made for actual fans of the Saw franchise. Tobin Bell is amazing and so is Shawnee Smith. This movie really has you rooting for the villain. The anti-hero if you will.John Kramer should have been the star of all the Saw films, because he is very easy to love and very easy to relate to. This movie has all the normal markings of a Saw movie with so much more heart and feeling. If you are a true fan, you will love this movie!It is a little slower than all the rest, but I actually preferred that! Such a good movie and I highly recommend watching for anyone who wants their adrenaline racing and their hearts pounding. You will love John and Amanda in this movie which is such a strange feeling. Watch it! You won't regret it!",2023-10-31
"For the SAW films to be successful they need to be worked on by an artist and collaborator like Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith.I have seen all the SAW films once, two or three times, for me they were all phenomenally successful, but the weakest one was without a doubt Spiral 2021,
I didn't even see a quarter of it, it was so poor, as the saying goes Maltese proverb ""bread is given to those who know how to eat it"" and this proverb continues like this ""and the work is given to those who know how to do it"" Congratulations Tobin Bell.Saw I Saw II Saw III Saw IV Saw V Saw VI Saw 3D Jigsaw Saw X. ⭐⭐",2023-10-22
"Saw X is not only a brilliant film, but an incredible sequel and addition to the franchise. The series has redeemed itself since the release of Jigsaw and Spiral.The film focuses heavily on Kramer's emotions and brings a more personal touch to his traps. Rather than the usual fast paced rushed editing of the traps, it focuses on John personally punishing his victims for what they did to him.Shawnee portrays Amanda perfectly in this sequel and shows her empathy for some of the victims, which is an interesting addition to the movie.The traps included in this movie have all the usual gore and shock factor to them that the rest of the movies have. The Saw movies are well known for their plot twists and this one was no different. The end plot twist was very clever as usual, and rounded the film off brilliantly.The ending of the film was a generally happy one as far as Saw goes, and it was a refreshing ending for once focusing on mainly John and Amanda.The post credit scene was an amazing addition, clearing up a question many viewers will have from the beginning of the film. It also answered a long awaited question for a lot of fans of the franchise.One of the best movies of the franchise in my opinion!",2023-09-29
"The story , effects and acting in this movie are all very good. I personally liked the movie because of John Kramer acting and the points he make about killing and torturing bad people. Saw movies all have a point that killing and torturing bad people is not a sick act but is to bring justice to society. But on the other hand this is a horror movie and it's not meant to teach us anything and is for our enjoyment . Which me and my girlfriend enjoyed watching this and was so excited when people were tortured and killed . For a horror movie they nailed it I don't see what more they had to do to make it better I think it's perfect.",2023-10-22
