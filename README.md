## 📝 Abstract
The study explored the capability of machine learning models in classifying sentiments in movie review texts. A dataset of reviews from the IMDB platform was used, applying a methodology involving data preparation, model implementation, training, and evaluation of their accuracy and efficiency. The results showed that BERT outperformed Naïve Bayes by 8% in accuracy, demonstrating the importance of deep learning techniques for sentiment analysis.
